0,98,98,98,98,Arjun: The Warrior Prince,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review21 Critic Reviews 4.4/5.0 2 Reader Reviews 5/5.0 8 Tweet Reviews 3.8/5.0,/movie/arjun-warrior-prince-review/,4.4/5.0,5/5.0,3.8/5.0,4.4,"Arjun: The Warrior Prince has decent animation by Indian standards which equate to very average ones by international ones, notwithstanding the differences in budgets. Also, the great epic has been tinkered around with to no advantage.","The quality of animation in the Walt Disney logo video (producer), despite repeated views, gets your hopes up for the animation film coming up. And of course, you are disappointed with the first scene. But, it won't be surprising if the money spent on that logo video is close to that spent on the whole Arjun: The Warrior Prince. Given that, I understand it's an unfair expectation and comparison. Even so, the faces and expressions in our animation is far behind.The backdrops on the other hand are much detailed. Even the patterns on clothes and jewelry is pretty intricate. Even the long shots, are conceptualized really well, the colors, the formations in the war sequences are aesthetic. Then, why the lack of imagination in the facial expression department. 2-3 variations each of how eyebrows, eyes and lips move are the only things you see. Same goes for body language and any movement - be it trees, water or animals. All these movements do come across as a few frames are missing between two gross movements. These things take away a lot from the experience of an animated film. Sure, some of these must be a function of money available but a lot of it also comes across as lack of talent. Another department our animated films lack in is the voice animation. That too doesn't have as much variation and thus distracts from the story being told. Mahabharat, the war itself - the events it encompasses, the many characters and their complex relationships - is humungous enough for a movie to cover in entirety. We know, the events leading up to the war are far beyond a single session of story-telling. So, it is indeed unfair to expect a 100-minute to cover it all. And thankfully, Arjun: The Warrior Prince doesn't attempt to do it all either. It clearly conveys that it intends to tell only so much and the rest is either to be looked up outside the film or it indicates that there is a part 2 coming up. However, seeing the war of Kurukshetra as epilogue text was hilarious. Like one would expect, it is assumed that we know of the central characters from earlier on. While I'm glad only few characters are explicitly introduced, the abrupt way in which characters are brought into the picture is rather disconcerting. As if no time was spent in thinking about how and when the character should blend in with the story, case in example, Bhishma Pitamah. Then come some liberties taken with the great epic. While some are acceptable as input by the maker like a tall Gandhari accompanying a short, blind Dhrithrashtra or the short and stout Shakuni (who is the tall Gandhari's brother). But there are others that are a no-no. For example, the way in which the chakravyuha formation of soldiers is shown - it didn't look like a maze at all! Not to mention its use in the Virat war with Arjun and Abhimanyu together is questionable. And a few other such changes in story, while wanting to narrate the story as we know. For a film titled Arjun: The Warrior Prince, I'd expect a lot more of Arjun's point of view. They do try, but it still feels like episodes one might have heard from a grandparent as a bedtime story. There isn't much more insight than that. Arjun: The Warrior Prince works as much as a comic strip book about him would. Except for much more intricate backdrops sans the speech/thought bubbles.

1,99,99,99,99,Arthur Christmas,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/arthur-christmas-review/,,5/5.0,,4.4,"Christmas. The season to be jolly; saccharine sweet holiday wishes and clichés floating around like the winter chill. Amidst all of this (had we in India been given the choice of a timely release), when a film comes out debasing and deconstructing  the main Christmas tradition (by employing Santa’s klutzy son to save the day) in a funny, charming way you know it’s a holiday (or the first month of the year, for us) well spent. ","Christmas movies are usually so predictable, you want to abandon the entire act of movie watching during the holidays. (Okay maybe Home Alone 1 wasn’t all that bad). While sometimes the cliché works, it becomes a delightful movie watching experience if you can pack in some innovation along with your regular message-in-a-film Christmas movie. Arthur Christmas is just that; a witty, creative and sparkling film based on the one question every kid wants the answer to: How does Santa deliver all gifts in one night?We are taken into the spectacular world of Santa’s elves (or in this case, the term military base would be appropriate) with a stellar opening sequence, which is a spoof on the mad rush before Christmas Eve. The setting is a battlefield and the mission is to deliver gifts to each child in the world. We are introduced to Santa’s army force then, who climb down roofs with black masks and heavy-duty equipment, (like gadgets to determine how asleep the children really are) dodge alarms and deliver. Reindeers to this force is like bullock carts to us. Back in the North Pole, having completed his 70th mission, we see that Santa is ready to retire. His older son Steve (Hugh Laurie), also responsible for modernizing the whole gift delivering process, is uptight and employs whip-cracking meticulousness. His younger son Arthur (James McAvoy) is the klutz; the underdog who we know will rise to occasion very soon in the film (exhibit A of clichés that work).  Before Christmas Day, they find that they have missed one delivery. While Steve thinks they can ignore the little girl, Gwen’s gift (voiced by Ramona Marquez), Arthur is bent on making the delivery. Every child is special, he says. And that is Arthur’s first win.Arthur Christmas is a delightful film, the kind that makes you really feel up to the holiday spirit. An intricate CG animated feature by Aardman Studio (in association with Sony Pictures Animation and also the studio that brought us Chicken Run) Arthur Christmas is a fascinating film with a sense of humor. It’s witty in many parts, indulging you in some clean, intuitive comedy. The film’s real gem though is the swift action, coupled with background music that could give any thrilling film a run for its money, that is used first in the opening sequence and then by Arthur and his team later in the film. The action, intervened welcomingly by fast humor every now and then, will keep you fidgety and involved, even though you know the outcome of the film. Rest assured there will also be a smile plastered on your face. Too bad Arthur Christmas released a bit too late in India. That remains the only disappointment of the film, but hey, Easter’s on its way?

2,100,100,100,100,[The] Artist,Owner's Pride!,wogma review,/movie/artist-review/,,,,4.4,"If you answer this question – How do two heavily French-accented actors pull off a silent film as a homage to the cinema of the 1920s – with an, “Wow, I have to find out”, you know The Artist has won its battle. Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo play George Valentin and Peppy Miller; the most charming lead pair you’d have come across in a while. Watch the film for its ability to make you feel nostalgic and genuinely smile, at almost every second. ","It’s a bit overwhelming to write a review of a film that has won 3 Academy awards barely 4 hours ago. Every person around me is throwing their opinions on The Artist – ""Did it deserve 3 awards?"" ""How it’s preposterous that so-and-so did not watch the film over the weekend."" ""How it’s actually an overrated rom-com""
 and the likes. While the Academy awards usually bring about healthy debates post its early morning broadcast, this year The Artist has been favored by most. Allow me to reason out why. The Artist is set during the mid-1920s. The plot seems adapted from films like Sunset Boulevard and Singin’ in the Rain (which talks about the rise and fall of a silent superstar with the introduction of the talkies), but where the The Artist stands out is in its lead pair’s ability to convince you that you’re actually back in the day. Not once does it give you the feeling of watching a homage film and primarily for that, The Artist holds your complete attention in its first 5 minutes. Jean Dujardin plays George Valentin, a famous silent star with the charming smile. It’s one of those pre-requisites that the lead actors walked around with: a charming smile, a thin mustache, a tap-dancing ability and you’re good to go. In Valentin’s case, he also has a pet dog, Uggy, who remains faithful to him till the last breath of the film (admittedly also my favorite character in the film, as he reminds me so much of Odie from the Garfield series). Anyhow, Valentin bumps into Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) at a movie and they have a moment. What follows reminds me severely of a scene in The Social Network
The Social Network, Eduardo mentions how Sean Parker made his biggest contribution to Facebook by excluding the ‘The’. Valentin in all his star wisdom adds a mole above Miller’s lip with a pencil. It’s this same mole that takes her places, that turns her into a superstar just when talkies have started to trend.We then see the fall of Valentin, his charming smile stands as nothing compared to the epidemic of hearing one’s favorite superstar speak. Every dramatic emotion is played out beautifully with orchestrated background music – from Valentin’s silent fears manifested in his dreams, to his tragic loss of fame as compared to Miller’s instant shot at success. And yet, every time they both appear on screen you wonder when all troubles will come to an end, and when life will only be about the dances. Berenice Bejo is downright lovable; you can see why the audiences adore her. She appeals to all also because she’s not the typical poofed-blonde-hair, curvaceous, uptight heroine (although a rarity now). Peppy Miller, on the other hand gives every woman who aspires to be a Hollywood star the permission to dream. The real winners of The Artist, then are not Dujardin and Bejo but the characters George Valentin and Peppy Miller, because together they make you fall in love with the movies. They make you forget you’re being told a story that is not new, and make you concentrate on the medium that is being chosen to tell it. Together they make you believe no matter what the mode The Artist, cannot be made without a charming lead pair. Where The Artist holds a disadvantage is addressing an audience that is so used to verbosity. It does tend to drag a bit, in parts where you have managed to overcome the awe of experiencing a silent film. That is so because even in similarly plotted films, the medium is contemporary and the silent era is only being referred to and discussed. Whereas, The Artist uses the very same medium to tell its story – the 4:3 aspect ratio reminds us of noisy projectors through which the movies were screened, glow lighting that created a unreal halo around the superstar of the film and heavily orchestrated music that serves as your cue to emote. For its sheer courage and innovation then, you willingly keep debates and speculation on hold, and MUST watch The Artist on the big screen – because anything else would be a crime. But more importantly because The Artist makes you fall in love with the movies all over again.

There are a few ""aawwww"" moments too. But, it is a tiny lecture on the changing value system and gets a little sarcastic. Cute in a very domestic sort-of a way.","The title by itself has the power to touch any urban, nuclear family. And I wouldn't be surprised if joint families and not-so-few households in the smaller towns would be similarly affected by the title. (Now whether they acknowledge it or not is a different issue altogether.) O unannounced guest - most likely an Indian phenomenon - will thou depart in this lifetime? The humor in the title is sustained in the film. It's not laugh out loud comedy, it's not very subtle either. It keeps that smile more because your day-to-day life is echoing on screen. The writer tries real hard to balance between two generations; between a village simpleton and the smartened, outwardly-hardened suburbanite. One has its value system intact, the other needs a little bit of dusting to reach the embedded 'good guy'. As one can imagine, all the stereotypes are in place. But they manage to get through without stepping on too many toes, too hard. You can't point at any one event or sub-plot and say, ""hey, no one does that!"" And yet, it steps into slapstick-villa or preach-zone every once in a while. It makes you go cringe-cringe. And then there are times at which Ajay Devgn and Konkona Sen Sharma go over-the-top. And that makes you go cringe-cringe too. Sure, between those cringes are the smiles and the laughs. At the silliness, at the good jokes and at the repetitions that work. There are also songs which are parodies of old, popular songs. Much fun and entertainment they are. And then there is Paresh Rawal - the perfect annoying, intrusive, meddling house-guest! It is just fun watching him a clean, nice comedy. Yet there is so much missing! Atithi is also another attempt at a Hrishikesh Mukherjee/Basu Chatterjee type of a film. There is even a tribute to Hamari Bahu Alka. But Atithi gets nowhere close to that charm or the warmth that those films exude. But the sarcasm is hard to miss. And sarcasm ain't all fun. I mean parents today sure can't teach their kids Sanskrit shlokas just like the older generation can't teach polished English or higher level Mathematics. Anyway, shouldn't all that be done by the people who are trained to do that - the teachers?! Then, what's the point of that whole sub-plot. Why use it to belittle that the parents are doing? I could literally go on and on about this issue. These are stereotypes we learn to live with. We flare at them when we see them in films, and move on. SO. Yeah, Atithi is serious about what it wants to say, very serious. But tries its best to keep it light. Keep the laughs going. And it does do a decent job of it, too.

And can we face their terror with anything but helplessness? A little tact, a few fumbles. A little beyond the obvious, a few facts edited/changed. ","""What...are these people? What kind of hatred...is this?"" Jt Commissioner Maria (Nana Patekar) is as baffled by the inconceivable ruthlessness of the 26/11 attacks as we were on 26 November, 2008. In another scene he's seeking help from the Central Government while the attacks are on, and his helplessness comes through with an exasperated, ""I don't know what to do."" The thought behind these two sentences reverberate within, even before they have been said out loud. The large space between these lines is what makes any terrorist attack what it is. Its attempt to address these lines is what makes The Attacks of 26/11 a movie worth watching. Unprepared, untrained, unequipped - that's how any police force would be when facing a terror attack of this nature. It's not that nothing should be done to prepare, train and equip ourselves better, but an attack without any tip, is bound to catch local law enforcement off-guard - people walking around with limitless ammunition, willing to kill or die. Just like when an airplane crashes into a building or several cases of serial bombing. The first half numbs you with episodes of the 26/11 attacks one after another. In this half though, weird camera angles, ridiculous focus on various statues (Laughing Buddha being the favorite!), loud screeching violins in the background - all annoy and distract. But the content is so close to home that you can mostly ignore them. The body count too seems exaggerated, be it at CST station or at the Taj Hotel (even if the film uses the Taj lobby as a symbol of all who died or were injured in all other places on that day.) But, throughout you make small connects with people who you could care for - children of course, but police officers and regular by-standers. The connect is obviously because it could have been you or me or someone we know. And Ram Gopal Verma appropriately cashes in on this connect, even if with little finesse. Whether or not the film would be more human, more engaging, if in the hands of another director - I don't want to know. In fact, that issue remains throughout. Am I connecting with the film because of the characters and how the film is narrated or is it inherent with my connect to the incident itself? Unfortunately, this is something I will never be able to answer. And this will work in the film's favor forever. Also, I am sure there are many unsung heroes in this incident that didn't make their way into the film. Surely, there are many changes and additions to the events to provide for that bit of drama needed to make a story into a film. Way too many times in the first half, you wonder, ""How do they know that happened?"" because everyone involved died. Also, the film covers only the events of 26/11 and not the two days after. Yet, that is the cinematic liberty we can allow to a maker who is trying to go beyond just the occurrences of this one event. The second half has two main scenes which bring about a balance that I didn't think a film on this event could bring about. It would be safe to say that we as a nation are not in the mood to understand the psyche of the terrorist who has the audacity of holding one of our cities at ransom. So, to try to bring about a sermon setting the right from the wrong might be considered a cop-out or brave; filmy or wise - depending on what your stand is. Surprisingly, I found myself in awe of (lapping up) Jt Commissioner Maria's word-for-word, thought-for-thought, concept-for-concept response in his spiel. All credit to some awesome dialogue writing and an overpowering dialogue delivery. Not to mention, the thought behind the said monologue, resonates with my attitude towards any strong religious sentiment used out of context and as a justification for hideous acts. Someone said it out loud. It doesn't matter then whether or not the Jt Commissioner actually had such a conversation in real life. Here the director is talking to us, the citizens of this country. And maybe he hopes to reach out to the oddball Jihadi who ends up watching his film. And if that does happen, the manner in which it is done reaches the viewer's gut and Nana Patekar's performance in that one scene could be enough to warrant a watch. What a relief it is to see him not resort to his typical style, but take a more restrained route. Even without the monologue, one shot where he is offered water shows you he needs no histrionics for a good performance. Here, the close-ups are used brilliantly.Sanjeev Jaiswal as Kasab induces enough hatred to not want to watch him in any other film again. Then again, that is more because the character is not fictional. Only a few more films will determine whether or not he is a good actor. For now, that the audience was restless whenever he was on screen and abused strongly shows that he didn't goof up.Despite all that was good about the film, it is difficult to shake off the disgust felt when I heard that director, Ram Gopal Verma had visited the site of the attacks the day after. Insensitive of him, irresponsible of the people who allowed it to happen. The negativity that his visit had brought about, will stay forever and will always be a black mark against his product. Yet, such films are important. If not to remind us of the difference between the fundamentals of religion and being a fundamentalist, to remind us of questions we should not stop asking our resilient selves, ""Are our shores secure today?""

One of the best films in the Japanese horror genre, despite being devoid of ghosts.","It's with some skepticism I allowed my mother to sit through a film, which has the reputation of having one of the most famous torture scenes in cinematic history. (Some Priyadarshan films are also torture…more on that later.)Mom reads English slowly and doesn't catch all subtitles, but it is clear that Audition has enough in it visually to leave her disturbed. When she woke up next morning, she complained, ""What a terrible film you showed me last night. You should not watch these kinda films!"" But then, she'd said the same thing while watching The Exorcist and I've stopped heeding her advice ever since then. Good horror and gore is awesome. A genuinely scary film generates nervous smiles and laughter amongst its viewers. Despite not stating itself at the outset as a 'horror film', Takashi Miike's Audition, has plenty going for it to make you squirm. In 1999, when it was screened at various film festivals, Audition gained a reputation of being a film that witnessed walkouts by members of the audience. Whether this genuinely happened or it was a publicity-driven rumour, is unknown, but after having seen Audition on DVD, I'm not surprised they did. The plot, despite being a feminist revenge fantasy, is wafer thin. Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi), a widowed TV producer pretends to be Auditioning young women for a new show, when in fact he's really looking for a wife. He finds a demure, young candidate attractive, but as the film progresses, he comes face to face with her suspicious past. Director Takashi Miike uses a mixture of gore and realism to good effect, often teasing the viewer using Aoyama's dreams. Thankfully, he doesn’t portray it all as a casting couch and Aoyama’s character is not that of a producer lusting after a young woman, but instead, simply of that of a person genuinely wanting someone to spend his life with. Nevertheless, when he sits down to audition, Miike’s opinion of the current casting process in cinema becomes clear. “Man, I feel like a criminal,” says Aoyama. Miike’s casting of Asami (Eihi Shiina), the prospective actress, is spot on. Her submissive self, clean as it may seem, makes her the last person you’d trust with having a suspect background. Her character – aptly described in her application form for the acting assignment – provides the right amount of intrigue for Aoyama to notice her, among the numerous other contenders who turn up for the audition.The writing has several highpoints, especially during the climax, where it depends more on Asami’s lines for chills rather than simply gory visuals. It makes the climax full of several ""facepalm"" moments. All this, despite not resorting to 'creaky doors', 'monster under your bed' and 'curtains and the wind' horror. Miike proves that psychologically traumatised characters are far more effective at sending a chill down your spine, rather than loud, thumping background scores and mutilated corpses. Instead, the story breaks new ground by mounting its horror on the ‘what-ifs’ and ‘could have been’, rather than ‘what is’. What Miike leaves the viewer to guess, is whether things would have turned out the way they do, if Aoyama was really looking to cast an actress. Audition has all the elements that have come to characterise Japanese horror cinema - long-haired actress dressed in a white gown with her head bent low, a troubled history of characters, jump cuts, and the absence of a background score that is intended solely to scare. All of them have been symbolic of Japanese horror through the noughties, a time when Hollywood has been facing a writers’ block in producing original and genuinely scary films.Watch it once, when you’re alone.

For that itself, it becomes worth a watch despite being a little drab and a little stretched out in the end.","As a skeleton, Aurangzeb comes across as Don with justification behind the sudden appearance of an underworld personality's look-alike. A look-alike who is willing to take the Don's place as a Police spy. But add on the flesh of complications and turbulences that the said justification brings along with it and you have an engaging, intriguing thriller. If only, it was a little less flat in its narration. It's been ages since I have seen a film that has worked so hard on a story; both in terms of the overall twists and turns and in bringing in the human factor to its relationships. That too on a theme as rundown as the underworld vs cops one. Of course, Aurangzeb is more than just that. It dwells on the themes of a father-son relationship from many angles. Interestingly, it doesn't dwell too much into the characters individually. Maybe that is why you don't get as involved as you could have been. Also later, the film does end up resorting to the most common thing that a gangster movie does to move the story ahead - kill someone. In that sense, one particular murder is more out of place and throws Aurangzeb into 'decent watch' categaory instead of 'must watch'. Otherwise, till this particular event, the film in fact, surprises you with its unpredictability. The change of hearts, for once, seem plausible. Motivations of the main players are clear enough for them to behave the way they do. And of course, the performances make all the events seem more believable than otherwise.Arjun Kapoor plays twin brothers, Ajay and Vishal well. He expresses the angst and turmoil well, however goes a little flat when he has to express the characters' softer side. Fortunately, Aurangzeb doesn't need him to show the mellow shades of characters for too long. You have an actor in a double role who does a good job and yet you have someone with a much smaller role outshine him. If you had to guess the name, Rishi Kapoor will be one of the people on that list. Even so, after Agneepath, this performance shouldn't surprise us at all. Prithviraj Sukumar remains his cool solemn-face self throughout and is teased by his screen wife about it too. Amruta Singh induces a slap-worthy performance which is good because her character invokes despise. Even with his two-minute role, Anupam Kher's face stayed back with me. Yet, I am glad they didn't add bits of his back-story just for the sake of it.Similarly, it is such a welcome relief to not see snazzy bits added in, just to make it 'commercially viable'. Whether in the name of item numbers or in terms of action sequences. Even if it means the narration feels drab as the movie progresses. Aurangzeb is one of those little surprises that makes you look forward to the director's next venture, even if you aren't completely satisfied with what was served this time. Just for the thought put in the story, just for making an otherwise done-to-death theme interesting, Aurangzeb is worth the watch.

But at its very essence, Avatar is a story about love, hope and the fight for survival. The themes of colonisation and destruction of the native paradise are universal as is the film’s take on capitalism. Perhaps written with the Oscars in mind, Avatar is a movie that holds up a mirror to current society by setting it in the future and in a world outside our own.","Avatar is a movie about love, hope and the fight for survival. It is also a dark reminiscent of the colonial times as also an ugly reflection of the times today when nature and human life are sacrificed in the face of economic development and financial profits.It is 2154 and a huge multi-planetary corporation is hoping to hit the jackpot by hunting for a rare mineral called unobtanium on Pandora, an earth-like moon of a planet in outer space. In the process, they threaten the very existence of the locals, the Na'vi a humanoid species that inhabits the unobtanium-rich area. While the story itself has nothing new to offer, Cameron’s conceptualisation, vision and direction makes all the difference. Simply by turning the tables on alien movies Cameron makes a social statement about everything from capitalism to deforestation. The director chooses to work with relatively unknown actors -- a popular trend in Hollywood that has thrown up a completely new generation of superstars in the last decade -- and narrates the tale with conviction and a passion that very few directors can claim to boast of. Indeed, it is his vision and perception that towers way over the actors’ performances but gives you your money’s worth. Despite being almost three hours in duration, Avatar hardly feels as long as it is. A tight screenplay saves the day as to the immensely brilliant computer generated effects. The concept of Avatar was written way back in 1994. However Cameron insisted that the technology required for executing his vision was not present then. He has waited for over a decade and a half for the scientific know-how to catch up with his imagination. Eleven years after Titanic hit the screens and swept the Oscars, Cameron returns with yet another grand project touted to recreate history. Boy it has most certainly been worth the wait.

9,107,107,107,107,Avatarachi Goshta,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review,/movie/avatarachi-goshta-review/,,,,3.766666667,An inspirational tale of innocence hindered by loose execution.,"Children's minds are full of fantasies, wonders, adventures and probably what not. They fancy the world as a fairyland and build their own around it. Their wings don't need spaceships to traverse through galaxies. The universe becomes a never-ending canvas, where the colours of their dreams fearlessly portray their desires to achieve impossibilities. Even the tiniest thing turns into a matter of obsession for them. Indeed, it makes for a fascinating story. Avatarachi Goshta tries to capture that craze in an absolutely candid manner, sometimes even reviving your own childhood memories. Alas, the film fails to get a lot of mileage out of its compelling story.The soul of this film lies in the Dashavtar tales from Indian mythology. Kaustubh - an innocent, little boy - finds a strong resonance with these stories. He tirelessly listens to Lord Vishnu's folkloric adventures. His granny once tells him that Vishnu will take a human avatar - the Kalki, to destroy the darkness of Kaliyuga (the present era). One thing leads to another and Kaustubh feels that he is none other than the Kalki avatar. what happens next is surely worth exploring. And this is despite prolonged dullness in the film's writing as well as execution.Avatarachi Goshta is adorned with innocence and has plenty of funny elements up its sleeves. It doesn't turn out to be a laugh riot though. The subtleness in comic moments goes in the film's favour. Nevertheless, it also ends up disappointing you in the long run. Lengthy sequences between Kaustubh and Amod (Adinath Kothare) could've been far more bearable, had they not lacked humorous touch. Well, you don't essentially require comedy to stay hooked to a film. This one, however, badly needed some solid, crisp dialogues.Writer-director Nitin Dixit tries really hard to make it engrossing, and some of the moments even set up for an inspirational ending. He smartly captures the insecurities faced by kids. Thankfully, he doesn't go detailing their problems. But his efforts fall short and create philosophical noise instead. Dixit's directional style is good, but not exceptional. His minor mistakes (really minor to even notice) hamper the story's freshness, making the film a little sluggish and tedious. Mihiresh Joshi plays Kaustubh's part very well. Had he been guided diligently, he could've been more impactful. Yet, I am glad to see Kothare in such a natural role. Not that he is an  excellent actor. Nonetheless, this atheist tenant looks significantly convincing than the chocolate-boy in his last film Premasathi Coming Suun.After seeing the film's trailer, I was quite impressed with its camerawork. Yes; it tries to be stunning right from the beginning, and pretty much succeeds in its endeavours as well. Unfortunately, it lacks purpose. It is not that Avatarachi Goshta fails. In fact, it is one of refreshing stories of the year. But the problem is that you won't live with it in the time to come.

I could overhear Marvel comic fans discussing the move rigorously during the interval, and surprisingly, I also overheard a bunch of new-comers talk about how they’re going to buy the comics and read up on the film. We all collectively, however, walked out of the theatre starving for more. Don’t miss The Avengers!","Forgive me as I’ve not been an avid reader of the Marvel comics, so this review might be one of just the film. That said, I found myself hooting, cheering, laughing out loud and enjoying every minute of The Avengers, without being the comic-book fan. I did, however, read up at length about each character and their graph before the film, but even without a background study, The Avengers is a must-watch: for sheer indulgence into a world that is action-packed, entertaining and thrilling all at once. The Avengers intertwine the lives of previous superheroes (with their own movies): Captain America, Thor, Iron Man and Hulk. With Black Widow (Scarlett Johanssen) and Hawk-Eye (Jeremy Renner), they are brought together to prevent an event of global danger. Our heroes (and heroine) are tracking down the Tesseract, a cube of cosmic super-power, which was also present in the movies Iron Man 2, Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor. The Tesseract has landed itself in the wrong hands of Loki (Tom Hiddleson), the film’s wily villain and also Thor’s step-brother. Loki’s intentions are clear - to rule to world and subjugate as King. Director of the secret international peace-keeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D, Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) is worried and desperate. He rounds our super-heroes to save the world from this feudal monster – and it’s a cliché that works superbly. It holds you, makes you sit on the tiny, uncomfortable edge of the seat and rejoice/scream/cheer. The film takes no time to establish each super-hero, and through the film makes sure every characteristic of the heroes are brought in. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is sassy and suave as ever, Chris Evans as Captain America is brave and confused as the defiant World War II veteran.  The new entrants are as charming: Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk fits the part to a T, and Scarlett Johansson plays the sly Russian Spy Black Widow incorporating her personal flair to the character. Oh, but you spend roughly 10 mins of the film analyzing the characters. Before you know it, you are picked up from your seat and taken on the epic adventure that these Avengers take. Director Joss Whedon maintains an engaging pace, while the film shifts between blasting action sequences and witty repartee between characters. Ofcourse Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is at the fore-front of the humor, but surprisingly every character follows through. You are given enough moments in the film to laugh out loud and generally, have a good time. It’s a balance that has been struck to perfection. Although the plot-line is formulaic and a tad bit predictable, the film does leave you spontaneously wide-eyed with its compelling chemistry between each character and the witty-dialogue/grand-action routine. The Avengers is a mammoth spectacle. And yet, in retrospect you don’t feel deceived by an overdose of mindless action. Each character holds their own in the film, and is therefore a treat for those who prefer one particular character over another (Iron Man!). The 3D version adds to the grandeur of the film, with fluid camera work, you feel like a part of an adrenaline-pumped videogame. At 146 mins, The Avengers is worth every minute of your time.

11,109,109,109,109,Avengers: Age of Ultron,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review2 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/avengers-age-ultron-review/,,3/5.0,,3.1,"It seems impossible that a film could be bigger and better than The Avengers, but Joss Whedon’s follow up, Avengers: Age of Ultron, delivers and how! Always bitingly funny; sometimes scarily dark; and never once dipping in terms of just how much information it feeds you, Age of Ultron is a big film to absorb, but worth every minute of it.","When Avengers: Age of Ultron was announced, the biggest question fans would have had is, ‘How does one top The Avengers? How does one even match something as insanely fun as that, never mind surpassing it?’ The immediate pressure on writer-director Joss Whedon, of course, would be – how does he begin this next film, after that gargantuan extended climactic battle set in New York. Hardly any film has landed in theatres with the kind of expectations loaded onto it, as Age of Ultron has. Whedon, though, doesn’t merely beat the expectations – he subverts them, does his own thing, and  trumps it by creating a film that goes past the first film in just how grand and stunning it is. He does this from the get go, with a jaw-dropping opening sequence featuring all the Avengers appearing one after the other in a single take ultra-action shot, choreographed to gobsmacking perfection. From there, the ride only gets crazier.The elements that made the first film fun are all there – the all-star lineup; beautifully etched characters that bounce off each other through rib-ticklingly written snark masquerading as dialogue; the push-pull magnetism of these characters stretching in every direction to create a harmony between what they do and what they say; and of course, outrageous action set pieces that keep you hooked every second. Whedon quite simply pulls off a bigger, more complex film that doesn’t only broaden its scale, but which also travels deeper into the characters and opens them up from the inside.You see, this time they have a different adversary to contend with, when a brainchild of tech genius Tony Stark (or Iron Man, of course) that was meant to save the world becomes sentient, intelligent, and decides that the world is safest without the Avengers in it. Ultron comes to life, and the Avengers have to deal with an enemy born on the inside. To make matters harder, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch enter the fray, as they bring with them powers that seem the Avengers are no match for.The plot of the film is rather basic – a bad guy ascends and becomes increasingly powerful, until there is a big climactic faceoff between him and the ones who want to save the world from him. In that sense, those expecting to be blown away by ‘story’, may end up disappointed. Whedon’s genius really lies in how he manages to make such a hugely mounted film an intimate experience as well. The emotions the film plays with, the deep dark fears that pervade even the best of hearts, the element of sacrifice, of choosing to be a hero because you have the ability that others don’t, and so you also have the responsibilities that others don’t – these are all primal and elemental. Observing how he weaves these with this set of characters is a true joy to watch.So the Hulk and Natasha Romanoff have an interesting dynamic going on between them, even as Iron Man and Captain America haven’t ceased taking jibes at each other. Things get even more interesting as the Avengers deal with the twins Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, particularly as the latter has the ability to play tricks on their minds. It may not look it, but Age of Ultron is a dark film. Dolled up in the Marvel glitz, it never seems to slip into DC’s brooding Nolan-esque interpretations of a superhero (which first enthralled audiences, and now seems to draw their ire). No, Age of Ultron is very much a Marvel film, with all their staple ingredients, and it fits nicely into what has been seen so far in the Marvel cinematic universe, and what is coming up from them. In the Marvel cinematic universe, the ultimate battle of the Avengers will be with Thanos, who had appeared briefly in the mid-credits scene of the first film. So Age of Ultron is only a pitstop in the larger scheme of things. But Whedon ensures that Age of Ultron is a finite film in itself as well, because even as it sets things up for the next few films, it also has its own ending. When Age of Ultron ends, it feels like something has ended; that things will never be the same after this.This will be Joss Whedon’s last film at Marvel for the time being, so he makes sure that it ends on his terms.His framing and cutting are downright impressive. Sample this: Quicksilver, who can run at blinding speeds, is just about to engage in battle. As he preps himself, he reaches for… sports shoes. In a shot that doesn’t even last one full second, we see a stack of shoes of a popular global sportswear brand, before he one of picks them up. Aah, product placement, Josh Whedon style. Even the manner in which Whedon looks inside the minds of the Avengers – with expressionist montages cut with mind-boggling panache, is a big departure from stock Marvel films. Rarely has a film managed to keep the sustained pace and energy that Age of Ultron has. Even when it slows down to bring us closer to the characters, you’re still continuously bombarded with information (and, of course, delicious humour). In that sense, the film almost has a monotonous graph. It can get a bit too much to handle at times, but that’s only because Joss Whedon has under 150 minutes to leave his final imprint on the Marvel films. And boy, does he deliver in style.Age of Ultron is intense, spectacular and supremely fun. I’ve never subscribed to the theory that films are merely entertainment, but if films have to be entertainment, then Whedon shows the world that this is how it’s done.

There are definitely areas where it lacks, and some parts that were truly awesome. However, overall, I left the theatre not knowing what exactly what I thought of this one, and mildly irritated. Is that good?","Basically: I enjoyed myself. I really did. It was fun. The action sequences were better than the usual Marvel fare. The “war” part of it was commonplace. There were some witty lines, and some really funny ones too. But even though I had a lot of fun during the movie, I left the screen unsure, and mildly annoyed. The problem was the previous movies. Every single one before this have had the characters survive things that are absolutely un-survivable. Even when they died, they were fake deaths. The character revived only a few minutes later. Since death of a beloved character is an inevitability, I’m going to say, I wasn’t hit with the emotion that the music told me I should feel.Everything about the scene tells me I should be bawling my eyes out. Acting, camera-work, music, lighting, dialogue. Everything. But I don’t  feel it. All I feel is, “Nothing happened. They’ll just pop back in for the sequel. No harm done.”Since most characters in the movie have died once before, ‘knowing’ that it is a fake death is inevitable.  If they do come back from the dead, I’ll be really mad at the predictability, but if they don’t… well, the moment’s passed now, hasn’t it? I can’t feel the emotion again! It’s gone! That’s what leaves a sour taste in your mouth when you leave the cinema. The characters survive so much, that the emotional punch when they do die is lost.
Other than that, though, the movie is delightful.There are some REALLY cool parts, and some REALLY funny lines, the funniest being Spider-Man. Tom Holland shines as Peter Parker yet again, with his impeccable comic timing, and over-all dialogue delivery.However, it must be said that sometimes the jokes become a little too much. Yes, they’re funny, but  the time at which they’re said really doesn’t need a joke. It’s not just this film, it’s been done in a few movies before this one too.

Only this time he fails and gets another chance to do the right thing. A decent attempt at showing the psyche of a man who can kill without a thought. But nothing that cannot be missed.,"A hard-core, hot-headed, cold-blooded criminal has a past that resurfaces in unknown ways. It surprises him too by showing him his fuzzy, warm side. In the ""opposite attracts"" sense, it feels natural that another person's purity will amuse him and eventually draw him to the person. And all of this is played out well too. It is very clear that the story writer's focus is on the main character, Shivam (Emraan Hashmi). There is no attempt to talk about the other characters. They are a given, a fact that you can accept or reject - your call. Similarly the couple coincidences in the main plot are difficult to digest but they are presented in a very matter-of-factly manner - take it or leave it - the writer couldn't care less. There is an attempt to make characters more interesting. For example, Malik (Ashutosh Rana) is a person who takes pride in the fact that he is good at judging people and their motivations, but is it true all the time? How will he take it? Good thought for the audience to chew on, but it is not addressed satisfactorily. Such character developments are not given the strong conclusion that the set-up deserved. Very rarely does a Hindi movie build the whole story around just one character and sticks to that. No back story for the villain, the side-kick, the lead lady -  nothing!  While that hurts a little bit, at least my usual objection to the mixing of genres is held at bay. The focus on Shivam makes the character study at least that much more interesting. The product becomes worth the watch as the story of Shivam. The writer's implied arrogance however is easily forgiven, due to the justice done to Shivam's stylization and the depth in which his character has been portrayed. All of which would have been lost, had Emraan Hashmi not been composed and restrained in his performance. Be it as a romancer of the lady, the action-master gangster, the loner, or the loser who is looking for a meaning to his life. I just wish something could be done with his voice. (Or have they done it already? I don’t remember his voice being so jarring and whimpy in his more recent films.) The other person who really impressed with his performance is Purab Kohli playing the madcap goon who thinks he owns the world. It took me a while to recognize him. This was more because of his act rather than his make-up. On the other hand the women do nothing to evoke any emotion. It'd be unfair to blame them because the writing doesn't do justice to their characters. One is to plain vanilla, the other is in the most difficult situation a  woman could find herself in but the one scene that shows you the gravity of the situation comes way too late. Sure, the first scene does tell us about her situation, but it isn't followed up. The next scene shows her in the lap of luxury. It feels like a major continuity glitch in the writing, like they forgot to write a couple of scenes. The introductory scenes in Mohit Suri's films are both impressive and disappointing. They have a CSI episode kind of an expose only the build up here is not half as exciting. That's because, the basic plot of a criminal seeking redemption has done the rounds often enough. They try to add a little depth by including a family feud and the chaos an efficient outsider's (Shivam's) presence can do in an already tense situation. But, it goes nowhere and ultimately falls flat on the face. The filmmakers allude to spirituality and existentialism throughout the film. Afterall you have a monster trying to become the Buddha. If only they had done so with more conviction and didn't have to succumb to out-of-context song and dance. It's a slow, serious film.

However, its punctuated by tiring romance. What could've been a gripping drama, stretches too long and outstays its welcome by just that bit.","Azaan opens out like a Polish war film. Both stylish and serene. And the slick execution continues well into the film. The style in writing can also be seen with the main characters playing mind games with each other. But, unfortunately, none of it is taken deeper. These things which do make the first half of the film interesting, stay at the surface, or rather as a check mark in the list of to-dos. Action - check, emotional drama - check, romance - check. The romance is draining the viewer's resources of patience. And this is despite the fact that the romantic angle is an integral part of the story and how it culminates. So, even though I understand why it is necessary, I don't feel like tolerating it. And this is despite a very beautiful Candice Boucher. The missing ingredient is context. Romance has to be a little more than the lead lady catwalking her wardrobe over a couple of songs on beaches. Sachiin Joshi is not very inspiring either. I understand, his character, Azaan is grim and serious and he actually has no reason to emote anything else. But, there must be something about his personality or the character's traits that makes me want to watch his story for two hours. I loved the fact that the dialogue was minimalist. There are long silences and a lot of reactions are with expression alone. It adds to the mystery of the characters and the plot. The story by itself is something we have seen in non-Indian cinema earlier. But not too much has been done in the area of bio-terrorism and more importantly the psyche of terrorists hasn't been talked about a lot in our cinema. That in addition to the proper use of action is a gaping hole. Usually Hollywood action is aped just for the sake of action. In Azaan it is executed appropriately. Hence, I'm willing to let go a lot that goes wrong in the second half of the film. If I were a teacher, I'd give extra points to Azaan for effort. And do we give leeway for improvement over director, Prashant Chadha's last endeavor, Aap Ka Suroor?

Yet, it brings some form of closure to not-so-happy trip down nostalgia, even if it is fictional.","Yes, a woman is wronged when her husband, who she loves and more importantly, trusts cheats on her. Yes, a sports fan is wronged when a player they love and trusts, cheats or is even accused of cheating. When Emraan Hashmi trying his best to convince us that he is Mohammed Azharuddin, pleads to the cricket board saying, “You know me. Could I do that? Could I sell my country out?”, you feel like he is talking to the cricket fan in you. Especially because, it was unbelievable, when it did happen. If Azharuddin is a cheater, anyone else can be, right? So, the film brings about some sort of closure to that unpleasant time. Even if it is not very convincing – as a film, as a story. It is a good thing then, that a voiceover reads out a long disclaimer absolving the film from the responsibility of being a biopic. Because that would then require it to give some context to the Hansie Cronje allegation, the South African cricketer who was part of another scandal himself. The film would also have needed to be smarter about showing why it took 8 years for the goofy lawyer (Kunal Roy Kapoor) to smarten up. The film could also offer some explanation for taking cheap shots at other cricketers. It would have had to dig deeper and be much smarter. But hey, this is not a biopic. So we get newspaper articles strung together with a not so convincing actor playing the cricketer. Emraan Hashmi's performance is earnest. And it's not like the actor has to bear physical resemblance to the player. Even if you put a 70+ Amitabh Bachchan and tell me to believe he is Mohammad Azharuddin from the 90s, I will give you a benefit of doubt. But, the mannerism, the body language, his diction, something had to be in sync, right? Prachi Desai is appropriately demure as the first Mrs Azharuddin and does most with the little space she has.  But there is a huge distraction in Kunal Roy Kapoor's act, more specifically his uneven and where-are-you-from accent. Lara Dutta, as the lawyer too is too superficially written a character considering she has a big enough part. In fact, the only actor then who manages to convince is Nargis Fakhri who has to play an actress who cannot act well. As a story then, Azhar doesn't pace itself too well. For example, to start his story Azhar spends a lot of time on the player's childhood with zero mention of his rise from the streets of a regular household in Hyderabad. After a brief mention of his glorious debut, there is no mention of his efficiency as India's best captain, whose record was broken only 15-17 years later. There is a passing reference to his rich taste but barely any incident that lets that come through. Even if this were a 100% fictional character, we would need these details to get involved in the story.Our involvement is taken for granted and actually we give in willingly too. So, despite lapses in the narrative, despite dialogue writing that makes almost every character into a preacher with an 'inspirational quote of the day', despite unanswered questions, we stay interested. This interest, this engagement which was so willingly given without any doing from the filmmaker, is not used to its fullest.  In the end, if you come out of the theater feeling that the film was 'not too bad' it is quite likely that it is because we like the cricketer, we like cricket.

A story with a lot of meat is dealt with pretty superficially.,"Not too often is women's sexuality or rather her openness about her sexuality explored in Hindi films. For that, BA Pass can be appreciated. But other than that, it is a pretty hollow affair. There are lots of bold, sexual sequences which are dealt with pretty matter-of-factly. That could be a good thing, if that's what the scene aimed at conveying. There were tinges of pity and hatred you were supposed to feel, but you don't. The way Sarika's (Shilpa Shukla) character is built up, you'd have liked to hate her; similarly you'd have liked to feel bad for Mukesh (Shabad Kamal) but that feeling to is very superficial.Fortunately or unfortunately, this has nothing to do with the performances. The screenplay and/or direction are the culprit here. The film has a strong base of sexually explicit scenes, and it feels like the actors have put in an extra effort to feel comfortable in those sequences. Wherein lies the problem. The effort shows, instead of the chemistry reaching out to you. Which is still better than the awkward sex scenes that you see in Hindi films otherwise.Sure, here are a bunch of characters, that don't really feel anything for each other and so that distance is acceptable. But, that I connect with no one, either in a positive or negative way, keeps me from getting involved in the film as an experience. That besides, the story has a lot of meat in terms of a cheating wife who is in general a manipulative opportunist; a shy boy who is used; women who express their sexuality. But all these themes are explored rather half-heartedly, except for the sex angle, which gets plenty exposure. It's not like I'm asking for the other possibilities to get attention - like the dynamics of marital strain or sibling angle. You are shown tiny sparks but nothing on is dwelt on for too long. Just would have worked better if the themes they picked on were fleshed out better.Later, BA Pass becomes a hotch-potch of moments of despair. They too are forced, as if they had to do what they had to do because it was pre-decided that they are out to make a dark film. You then have a weird mix of stylized treatment which comes too late and is quite out of place. Halfway through the film, I wondered if my experience would've been any different had I seen the film with a serious film festival audience instead of being seated between an easily excitable bunch of boys. But, as the film progressed, I was relieved to feel assured that it wouldn't make much of a difference. As disconnected as it may sound, the film's title is what impressed me the most. Ironical to the root, BA Pass is a title that fits the film perfectly in more than one ways. Unfortunately, that's where the impact of the film stops - skin deep.

For context, it's been an hour since I saw Baabarr. Can't think of much other than the brutality of the human being. It's the law of the jungle, only the fittest shall continue living. Sure, there's a story and an interesting one too. But again, very little is new.","Most underworld-crime based films more or less have to circle around the ""vanity of vengeance"". With an audience that mostly doesn't belong to the world from where the characters of the film come, the story writers pretty much don't have a choice. And yet, through this situation the writers here have made the going as interesting as possible. Building characters along the way. Creating situations for unrest at regular intervals. The pre-requisite for a crime-based action film is a swift pace and that is one thing Baabarr doesn't lack. There's always something happening and one situation leads to another in a clean and clear flow. And so is the flow of the ""boom-dishum-bang-dhickyau"". The gun-mania just won't take a rest. As if the little boy just found a new toy. I'm not easily disturbed by violence, but Baabarr in Hindi cinema takes it to a new level. There was one scene in which I actually felt sick in my stomach. And what can I say you can count the number of non-violent scenes on your fingers. And even in those scenes the dialogue is about the violence that took place or was going to take place. Yet, it's not like the characters haven't been worked upon. Each type of characters have traits that stay consistent and comply with the boundaries set for them. Thus adding to the believability. They were given decent dialogues too. Though all characters, most of the time, have to either scare or get scared, there's not much wrong with the acting department. Except for maybe Mithun Chakroborty who just can't seem to keep the actor's style out of the character. 
Also the grainy texture adds to the ""realistic"" feel of the film. The handheld, jerky camera is put to use almost continuously, but there is chaos and tension throughout the movie too. One refreshing aspect is that the backdrop is neither Mumbai nor Hindi cinema's favorite Punjab. They've also tucked in tributes to presumed inspirations like The Godfather and Satya. But, it would be only a shock if they didn't do that. We see 5, maybe even 10 films, based on some underworld concept every year. The storyline can only be so much different. The only basis for watching one and not another could be something different tried in the build-up towards the climax. Baabar has a couple of vexing situations but that's about it. And besides the excessive gore this isn't much of a variant from other crime-related fields.

It is obvious that the makers ran out of time using all the possible cinematic liberties and had to rush the content in the last half-hour. This one clearly has the same target audience as Baghban, but might appeal to a wider range of viewers because this time, people in the 30-40 age group will also identify with the characters. This is one of those rare movies where the second half is of a much higher standard than the first. It just might have to do with who has more dialogues. The first half has Salman, Salman and more Salman grunting out lines. But, the second half you are left mesmerized by the real boss, Amitabh Bachchan. Rani Mukherjee shows the audience what acting is all about and looks gorgeous, especially with less make-up. It’s sad when elaborate lines are used to sketch out characters rather than facial expressions and body language, when you have the top actors at your disposal. Hema Malini looks great but has given a very dry performance. To Salman Khan’s credit though, there is this very specific thing that he can do - get a grin out of you with no acting whatsoever. He can deliver comic lines really well. That’s how the movie starts - light, romantic moments. Some executed well and some absolute rubbish. But post-intermission, even though the pace slackens, the emotional scenes are portrayed with a lot of sensitivity. The movie is worth a watch just to see how different characters handle their grief. These sequences will surely bring more than a tear to your eye. The title song, composed and sung by Amitabh Bachchan simply leaves you speechless. Once you get over the fact that the songs don’t have any reason to be there, you can begin enjoying them. There are a couple really good songs ‘baawri piya’, ‘har manzar’, and ‘bebasi dard ka aalam’. “Chalo chalo” is a foot-tapping, sweetly picturised number. The lyrics are a very small notch above the usual unimaginative Sameer fare.What really went wrong then? The dialogues. There are some really good dialogues, but when you find out that they were actually implanted there to be repeated later for senseless melodramatic effect, all you can say is, “Oh God!!”. Not once, not twice… oh well, I lost count after five. Then there are the inane sermonizing dialogues that are repeated in passive and active voice, like a teacher would to drill a point into the students’ brains.The tedious length and lack-luster dialogues fail to retain attention despite a good choice of subject.

Alas, you come to expect what happens in the last hour and lose the thrill along the way.","It is easy to dismiss a film that has a lot of “style” with the “form over substance” argument. Baadshaho tries to counter that presumed dismissal with an attempt at balance between story and swagger. But loses steam post-interval and becomes predictably haphazard. That is as much a testament to the makers' consistency across films as it is to the seasoned Hindi action film watchers in us.Most films give enough mind space to the audience to predict what will happen next or a parallel thought on whether or not you are enjoying a film. Baadshaho doesn't give you much of a chance to think about how you are feeling about the film and succeeds in keeping you guessing about the next twist in a good way – but only in the first half. And that is a tragedy.Every time Bhavani & Co. (Ajay Devgn & Co.) get into a soup, you think of the many ways that they might get out of it. The film surprises with its solution. Only difference is in the first half, you think it is smart, as interval approached things become quite laughable. The last hour just goes loose. The only intention seems to be to complete a heist-action film to-do list:
Story-wise,
Double-crossing: check
Out-smarting: check
Execution-wise:
Chase sequence: check
Lock-opening sequence: check
Police torture sequence: checkWhile some of these could have worked to the film's advantage, as story elements they become tedious. It then becomes, any other action slick-flick in a different setting. Rajasthan, 70s. Rajasthan is used to give the film a dusty, grungy texture and 70s is used as a loophole, everything that sounds implausible is explained away using the emergency. All the signs of subtle character exposition (dare I say) in the first half are exposed and given a twist with an additional story. It could have been a study of changing perceptions as you know more of the story. But characters behave rather randomly and you lose all the interest you had in them in the beginning. For the action part, it became more about appreciating what wasn't there rather than what was. Again, in the first half at least the background score didn't become the ever-pulsating beat that we are soon becoming desensitised to. Also, it was good to see a chase sequence that didn't have the predictable shattering of property – a pottery stall here, a vegetable cart there. The climax fight sequence is well-shot but is long and is better positioned in a showreel rather than the film's reel. Unfortunately, though the songs seem nice to listen to, they are obviously fillers in the films. What we are left with then is the super-cool performances. Like in the trailer, almost every line has a “filmy” edge to it, irrespective of who is delivering it. But, the trailer has taken up the better lines and you are left with barely any new “super-cool” ones for the rest of the film. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the performances too are rid of their energy in the second half – across the board. Not that we haven't seen any of them – Ajay Devgn, Emraan Hashmi, Esha Gupta, Sanjai Mishra, Vidyut Jamwal – in these forms earlier. They continue their act. Ileana D'cruz is the only one who is slightly different because of the character she plays. Her act as a shrewd ruler to a dramatic and sympathetic one are both convincing. What doesn't work though is the way the character is written itself – it is with the intent to keep the audience guessing rather than serving the story. We go back to “form over substance” with a half-hearted attempt at form. As an audience, grateful for the attempt, I am. But, that attempt didn't make it an immersive or enjoyable couple of hours at the theater.

That, in the end, it all turns out to be rather ‘meh’ as expected, is another matter.","The thing about things unexpected is that you end up valuing them more than you really should. Like say the semblance of a plot about a missing 3-year old turning into something even more interesting. Baaghi 2 keeps you wondering about, “but why has the child been kidnapped?” through the film. In fact, you are waiting so long for the answer that you lose interest in it. And even worse, when you do come to know it all seems off-landish. Having said that, so little was my hope of being engaged or entertained by this film that I was surprised to find myself interested. Other than that externality though, Baaghi 2 has very little going for it. The action is aggressive and has lots of sound effects to make it seem more intense but is nothing you have not seen before or would miss if you haven’t seen it at all. The music is insipid and you sense a shudder down the spine as you watch the choreography team and Jacqueline Fernandez ruthlessly murder ‘ek do teen’. Haven’t songs that force themselves into the narrative, most of all item numbers, gone out of fashion yet? I didn’t if I ought to laugh or cry when Baaghi 2 was clearly at a point where there was no room for a song and had the protagonist go into a flashback to make room for a song. Sure, this particular song was weaved into the story but the jolt with which you are taken into the song makes that weaving lose the little credibility it has. All than I can do then is appreciate the attempt. Speaking of things that ought to have never come into fashion, why are characters still being introduced in slo-mo? What is the point? How are additional tools to add drama to the narrative applicable at the beginning of the film, while introducing a character?Anyway, maybe the makers are admitting that the character and/or the actor are not capable of holding our attention without this gimmickry. Which is evident when you see Tiger Shroff being earnest on screen and still not striking a chord or when you see Disha Patani on screen and wonder if you would know she is worried about a missing child had she not told you so repeatedly. Prateik Babbar’s act was unintentionally amusing. And while having Manoj Bajpai and Deepak Dobriyal is some consolance, it can hardly be fair to them. Randeep Hooda’s act is over-the-top and is yet another out-of-fashion element – the comic relief. It is difficult to fault some of these actors because while the plot elements are intriguing, the tiny details are uninteresting at times and at other times, they fall in the usual range of appalling casual sexism and pandering to popular views. That leaves me then with one question – why Baaghi? Not, why Baaghi 2? I wasn’t expecting to find that answer at all. But, why Baaghi at all? Where’s the rebel?

The background music is relentless, especially in the second half. Even if it takes a breather for a few seconds, you can feel it in the silence because of its assault thus far.  It is as if all the onus of building suspense was left to it, because – no story.You can't fault the writers though. They have been asked to fit the story to squeeze in as many action sequences as is possible. There is no building character, only piling one action sequence after another. In fact, the only way they allow the lead lady to hold her own is by throwing in a kick or two. The story is summarised as follows: Boy meets girl. Another boy also meets girl, kidnaps her. What happens next?What is going to happen next? I doubt there can be anything more predictable than the answer to that question. So, what can you do? More action. Of course.The actions sequences are repetitive and offer nothing in terms of variety. There are a few times they have a couple of characters hold postures that look mind-blowing and make you admire the ab-control. And there a few other scenes where bones are broken in a manner to make you jolt. The one main thing that that one-liner leaves out is the performances. But, that it was left out must mean a lot by itself, right? Tiger Shroff cannot act. Well, at least not so far. Each line comes out as if it is the dialogue of the decade. That is as filmy as it gets. Shraddha Kapoor maybe can but there is nothing worthy required here. Her kicks and chops aren't the best. Though, unlikely as it is, I hope that is intentional because her character is not really an expert. Other than that there are these 'comic relief' characters that remind you of the worst from the 90s. The attempt at tugging at your heart is so superficial that they don't even bother to give you a backstory or resolution. Oh well. The only good thing I can say about Baaghi is that I have seen worse.

The answer to each question could range from yes to no via maybe, but the answer to the most important of them all is an emphatic no - does Baar Baar Dekho engage us with a story that deals with these questions? And just in case you asked, does Baar Baar Dekho purport to answer these questions? Yes.  Baar Baar Dekho is a love triangle between the boy, the girl and the boy's work. However, you don't see the chemistry between the boy and his work. And that between Jai (Siddharth Malhotra) and Diya (Katrina Kaif) is intermittent, most of which you have seen in the trailer. So, there goes your involvement with the characters and their emotions. What you are left with then is an average romantic film with one of the two people involved isn't quite sure and it takes two hours worth of film to convince him/her one way or the other. Of course, this one has been done to death. The filmmakers aren't oblivious to it either. Enter – time-warp. The back and forth, if you can call it that, in the film's narrative gets tiring by interval. Thereafter the rhythm doesn't vary much either. What the writers might have thought of  as variation and/or a twist to catch the audience off-guard isn't much of either – change or surprise. The non-linear cum time travel exercise then, comes across merely as a cute idea, rather than romantic or insightful.The problem isn't that there is little romance or profundity. The problem is that the film thinks it is being charming and insightful. Even so, Siddharth Malhotra tries his best. You get his confusion. You kind-a sort-a get his eureka moment too. The one or two moments of “aawwww” felt over-written because they are repeated. The actor's conviction in dialogue delivery isn't enough then. Katrina Kaif on the other hand seems like she jumped into this one straight from Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara's “Live the moment” Laila. Of course, she has her teary and serious moments. But then, you are distracted from those with awful prosthetics. The other actors, Ram Kapoor, Sarika, Sayani Gupta, Rohan Joshi, Rajit Kapoor provide their few lines worth of boisterousness, composure, oomph, comic relief and mystery respectively. In the background is music that does its job very well. Compared to a usual Hindi film, there are long silences in the score. And when it plays, the music is a pleasant fusion of instruments. Yep, yet not enough to make it worth a watch. The unwieldy narration makes Baar Baar Dekho a tiring watch. The romance doesn't coo enough. The comedy is almost non-existent. The time travel bit makes it look like it is an attakh on nerds rather than the concept of passion for work. Let alone the question of why we are attacking the passion in the first place.

24,122,122,122,122,Baboo Band Baaja,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/baboo-band-baaja-review/,,,,4,"If a little tugging at your heartstrings is what you need, then Baboo Band Baaja is the film for you this weekend. This multiple National Award-winning film is a simple story of the tough circumstances a family in a village face, and the manner in which they deal with it. Embellished with some earnest performances that are hard to forget, this little gem is the kind of film that we should feel responsible to support. ","It has been a while since a film made me smell the earthen floor of a hut, the tulsi (holy basil) in the courtyard, the fragrance that rises when you spill water on the soil of dry, hot land. Baboo Band Baaja isn’t the first film to be set in rural Maharashtra, but it is one of those films that will not leave me in a hurry, no matter how many Housefulls and Golmaals I watch along the way. A poignant, touching tale of a simple family, Baboo Band Baaja has been made with the kind of honesty and sincerity that is rare to find in Indian cinema today.Jaggu is a man who runs a band that plays at every occasion in the village, be it a funeral or a marriage. A band that he has named after his only son, Baboo. Baboo’s mother does odd jobs for a living and has big dreams for her son – she wants to educate him in the best possible manner, against all odds. But their circumstances are such that they can’t even afford to buy him a school uniform. Jaggu, on the other hand, believes that his son should take after him in the band, since that is what the men in their family have been doing for generations. Stuck in the middle is Baboo, a bright little kid who is always thrown out of class for some reason or the other. The film is essentially the story of the cards that life deals this troubled family and how they cope with them. The most striking aspect of this film is the lead cast. Milind Shinde as Jaggu, Vivek Chabukswar as little Baboo and Mitali Jagtap Varadkar as his mother play their parts so well that, for the first time in many years, I forgot I was watching a film. The connect with the characters, their joys, their sorrows, with their very lives felt so real that when the lights came on, first in the interval and then at the end, it felt like a jolt back to reality. No wonder then that Mitali and young Vivek won National Awards for their performances in this film.Director, Pinjani deserves full marks for treating the film the way he has. When making a film like this, it is easy to get over-indulgent. But Rajesh Pinjani keeps any form of indulgence to a minimum, letting the village setting and the spontaneity of his cast do the talking instead. Also, a special mention must go to the editor of the film, Santosh Gothoskar. There is only one thing I can say about him – he has edited the film with love. Baboo Band Baaja is really about the little nuances of life that the director chooses to show – the love that a mother has for her child, the frustrated existence of a man who has resigned himself to the fact that neither he nor his son can ever rise above their financial problems, the spirited grandmother who warms your heart every time she protects the little child from a thrashing, the pride that a mother feels when her son recites the tables of 2. Every little scene evokes a little bit of warmth, a little bit of sorrow, and a whole lot of wonder at the choices that the debutante director makes in the journey of the film.Baboo Band Baaja manages to take a slice out of village life and place it before audiences who are ordinarily subjected to, well, tripe. Like Deool, it is one of those films that makes the Marathi film industry proud. I only hope that there are enough screens that are showing this film with subtitles, so that the audience is not limited to only people who understand Marathi. Baboo Band Baaja is a film worth investing in, not just financially, but emotionally as well.

","Babumoshai Bandookbaaz is as raw and rugged as any noir film set in the world of politicians who double-cross and hire contract killers can be expected to be. It stays crude through the sex and violence – both of which it has in plenty. However, what gives way is its limp writing in the last half hour. Over the years, I have learnt not to be led on by great starts and greater build-ups. Far too many times, the climax is well...anti-climatic. While I wouldn't call Babumoshai Bandookbaaz anti-climatic, but it is rather disappointing because it seems like a cop out. All the strength of the film though is in its characters. There isn't a good soul in this  milieu. They are all just different shades of dark grey. As sad as that is, it is sadder that that's the reason the film feels real. Of course, brilliant performances across the board help things along. I don't know if I will ever tire of seeing Nawazuddin Siddiqui in a crude villager's role. Especially the one who has a swagger. But then here, everyone has a swagger, and each one carries it with elan. Banke (Jatin Goswami), Phulva (Bidita Bag), the various police officers, their wives, the politicians and a politician's wife – all behave as if they own the place. The film has a very interesting set of women characters. Most of them are strong-headed. Most of them are the kind you wouldn't cross in a hurry. And very interestingly, the leading men and the main side characters – are all respectful or rather not threatened of the women's independence. Of course, there is letching and prostitution is shown openly. But, the women are far from submissive. And yet it all looks real. That's how well the characters are written. If only, the writers didn't lose steam towards the end. What is heartening though is that the main draw of this film was Nawazuddin Siddiqui and of the three films I saw today, the other two had two other people in the audience. Babumoshai Bandookbaaz was almost house full, and in a bigger hall too! Whether or not I like the film, that a non-standard film gets its chance with the audience makes this festive season even brighter. And this one does it despite being dark to the core.

","It's Pakistan incessantly organizing terrorist attacks in India. It's an Indian daredevil hero, who is almost a superhero. He is single-handedly taking the enemy out. What's not to like about the story? Even if it's predictable it has enough action sequences where the bad guy gets beaten up for you to feel good about yourself as a nation. The hero's victory is somehow your victory. All of this we expected from the film. What worked for me was the heart pounding through most of the second half. Even if, this one is no A Wednesday, especially in terms of having a  relatively tight plot, Baby has a few strong sequences that keep the suspense on.In fact, the said sequences can be thought of as short stories by themselves. The episode in Nepal and then the one in Saudi Arabia were, save for a scene or two, gripping from end-to-end. And this is even when you know any sequence has only two possible outcomes. It helps that the villain seems capable of anything. He (they) is ruthless and has no regard for human life, let alone sentiment. These sequences also make the film a little episodic though. It is a good thing then that the episodes are linked to one another, even if only serially. More like bogies of a train, lacking the character of pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. There are points at which Baby seems to go high on drama, but there are many other times that were ripe for drama but it was avoided, adding an edge to the narrative. It also helps that none of the performances, except maybe the whole wife-angle, are dramatic. It is not a routine slice of life, it is the story of covert operations and spies and all things related. Yet, you cannot let go of the fact, that Baby as a film doesn't show you anything new. It keeps you glued to your seat, but does it offer something that you've never seen before? No. Does it keep you glued through and through the 2.5+ hours of the film? No. The first half makes you shift in your seat rather than bring you on the edge. Yet, by far it is one of the most thrilling films in the last year or so. I don't remember the last time I was nervous for the hero (that too, one played by Akshay Kumar) even though I knew more or less where the film was headed. To top it off, for a good hour or so. It ain't new, yet it keeps you glued. That counts for quite a bit.

But alas, the finer points lack polish and the wimpy, predictable end completely disappoints.","Once Aditya Chopra is done patting his back and reminding us that he's the man behind Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge and once you get back into the habit of not looking for a reference to a Yash Raj film, the story begins to emerge. Women with strong characters and a fairly mature portrayal of relationships are the two things that Bachna Ae Haseeno can surely boast about. Falling in love is almost always a random occurrence in Hindi movies. You just ""come...and fall in love"". But Bachna Ae Haseeno deals with the complexities and the process of how the characters are led-on and betrayed, how they hurt, how long the healing process takes, and ultimately how all the relationship needs is closure.I'm a sucker for even relatively coherent plots. And here I have two! Ideally I would be ecstatic. But - yeah, obviously there's a but - it’s only the overall stories that are pretty neat and novel. The details that add up to the pretty bird's eye view of the stories are very ordinary. Also, this third story hanging around is so lame that it begs for negative marking. There are these other subtle things that blended pretty well into the story. Raj (Ranbir Kapoor), the boy whose only focus in life is to woo a girl because he's in Europe, grows into a person who would do what it takes to maintain his independence. Then he smoothly turns into a mature person who's ready to introspect and bear the burden of his responsibilities. For this you have to tolerate Ranbir's boyish chuckle and puppy eyes, though. To be fair, there are glimpses of very good timing, especially post-interval when he's reacting rather than being the center of attraction. He has the boyish charm because of which the audience feels for him, despite his character doing the meanest things to people around him.The women, each in their own right have a whole range of emotions to play around with and do pretty good justice to them too. Interestingly though, the character arc for each one of them is such that each one has to play smitten, confident, fun-loving, hurt, vengeful, shrewd at some point or the other and they all have the same way of expressing these emotions. So, an indignant  Minissha looks exactly like the indignant Bipasha or the attitude that Bipasha throws around feels very similar to the attitude Deepika is wearing. Almost as if, the briefing they were given related to only one character. And yet the characters are all different. So, what's going on here? We have pretty good performances. Though Deepika's voice doesn't vary much and her dubbing doesn't match the intensity with which the lines are said. But I absolutely enjoyed Bipasha's track - both, due to her acting, and the way her character is written. Minissha Lamba's story is actually the most charming of the lot. The characters in general are pretty well-detailed. Yet the film fails to touch in absolute terms. For one, the structure of the story is too episodic. Granted the chapter-like feel is intentional but it cut the movie too sharply into 20-25 minute pieces. Individually, these pieces don't always work either. The first two pieces in fact, feel like a set-up for the actual show. And they certainly need better lines than ""we're abroad, we can't miss a train"" (what does that even mean!?). Lighting a thousand candles and wiping off smudged kajal (eye make-up) from your girl's eye somehow don't generate chemistry automatically. The sincerity in the eye contact, the stance of the body, the way the two bodies hold each other are all missing in most instances. Even a nice human being can brutally mistreat the person who has wronged them. But if the mistreatment is exaggerated, with the sole purpose of arousing sympathy of the audience, it gets irritating. Ultimately, the climax kills the otherwise decent plot. It's rushed and thus dissatisfying. Aditya Chopra/Siddharth Anand come up with fairly non-standard (in Hindi cinema) concepts. These concepts revolve around the situations that the urban population in the mid-late twenties faces. You can almost see the concerns change over the years. Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge - Dil To Pagal Hai - Hum Tum - Salaam Namaste. And now the love vs. marriage debate. They take a very contemporary and relatively mature look at the problems and then cop out! They literally chicken out so that we don't feel too bad while walking out of the movie. That's sad because we as an audience are ready to take it, now. Then, there are these other things like having only one song before half-time which is picturized with Deepika Padukone. No doubt, this one is the typical good-locale-let's-dance-here kinds. But, if put in context with the placement and styles chosen for the two other songs with Minissha and Bipasha, you figure that its not without purpose, is very much in line with the subtext of the story and relates to how the male lead character feels for these women.

It’s a film about a bad teacher, that stays bad for the most part and (tries to) engulf you in her day-to-day activities. Yawn worthy - unless you want to go watch it for just Cameron Diaz. Now that I would recommend. ","Cameron Diaz is a BAD teacher. Oh and there’re no end-of-movie revelations or transformations. She’s a horrible teacher, with no real sense of responsibility, character or inclination to be of any help – and that stays. If anything, maybe one can find humor in this fact, because every other gag is either lewd or more lewd. The film is intermittently funny, but what makes Cameron Diaz a watchable film are the characters. Foul-mouthed, greedy and self-obsessed Elizabeth Hasley (Cameron Diaz) is an unapologetic character who’s returned to her teaching job at John Adams Middle School after being dumped by her fiancé. A wastrel by nature – she ends up showing movies in class for weeks at end, smokes pot in the parking lot and generally doesn’t give a rat’s... bottom.The pace of the film picks up when the new substitute teacher Scott makes an entry (Justin Timberlake) – he’s rich, good-hearted and the best bait for Elizabeth. That’s where the theatre begins. She does all it takes to get his attention – from competing with the goody-two-shoes Amy (Lucy Punch) to generally throwing her sexuality around. Meanwhile, she brushes off Gym teacher Russell’s advances (Jason Segal of How I Met Your Mother fame)Even if we manage to move past the sporadic pacing of Diaz’s character – the logic behind her nature shifts between being extremely rude and sexually explicit within seconds - there’s one thing that I couldn’t overlook. Not just merely a screenplay flaw, but this just stands as common sense. How Could Anybody Ignore Cameron Diaz (her highness hotness)? The very fact that Diaz has to fight for Timberlake’s attention is a big fat question mark on the writing or credibility of the film – especially since with this movie, Diaz is at her sexiest best.Bad Teacher starts out as a fearless, upfront film, but somewhere it loses its plot. The film steers in many directions – at some point you’re expecting the scene to get more vulgar but it cuts to a totally unrelated scene. The characters, Timberlake and Segal included, are funny in moments but in larger scheme of things, Bad Teacher heads in no particular direction and exists just for a handful. In the film’s defense, you can squirm around in these questions and still enjoy the movie because it doesn’t try one bit to be liked. Jake Kasdan is pretty clear in his agenda for Bad Teacher. You hate her so much, you will love the film. Unfortunately he got the first part right – but there’s a tiny flaw. You hate  Diaz but you also develop the major hots for her. That might or might not work for the film, but because I can be objective about this, I can tell you that the film is watchable for a few scenes and mostly for Cameron Diaz. She is crass, sexy and downright unapologetic – it’s a good film to watch if you’re in the mood for a sassy flick about, virtually nothing.

29,127,127,127,127,Badam Rani Gulam Chor,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review3 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/badam-rani-gulam-chor-review/,,3/5.0,,3.266666667,"Satish Rajwade’s Badam Rani Gulaam Chor is a film that hides a concept that had the potential to blow your mind. Since the makers squandered away the opportunity to make a memorable film, what we end up with is a fairly enjoyable little flick that isn’t half a bad watch. It has enough funny moments to still make it worth your while.","Despite the impressions that social and online media seem to be giving, there were other films that released this week as well, ones that did not have a caped crusader as their main protagonist. One of them, Mumbai Pune Mumbai director Satish Rajwade’s latest film, Badam Rani Gulam Chor, is an interestingly written and narrated film that is engaging for the most part, even if it often transgresses into being a tad silly. Upendra Limaye, Anand Ingale and Pushkar Shrotri play three friends who live together in a house named ‘Unbreakables’, something that supposedly signifies the nature of their friendship. What their characters have been named doesn’t matter, because they refer to each other as ‘Chaku’ (knife), ‘Maakad’ (monkey) and ‘Pustak’ (book), respectively. Enter Mukta Barve, nicknamed ‘Pencil’ - a woman who is destined to change their lives for good. Simultaneously, Anand Ingle’s character works at a news channel, which is currently covering a major political story, a bust up between two politicians who belonged to the same party.There is inherently nothing new about either of these stories by themselves. But start watching them together, start seeing near-metaphysical connections between them, start drawing parallels between the two and suddenly they seem to be far more similar to each other than it appears on the surface.These two story lines, the parallels drawn between them and the sheer thought behind intertwining them to tell a story is what sets this film apart. In fact, at the concept level it is a stroke of sheer genius. A tantalizingly intelligent use of a medium whose power is currently in shackles because it is easier to do what has been done and make money than pushing the envelope at the risk of losing it.Using comedy backed by strong performances, the film tries hard to do justice to this thought, and achieves it in some measure, but not completely. The reason? Instead of going full throttle on the concept of connecting two seemingly disjoint stories by using the power of narrative and editing, the effort seems to be more on providing a screwball comedy instead. Not a bad idea at all, but one that ends up affecting the basic premise.Still, Badam Rani Gulam Chor manages to have the audience in splits for the most part, not least because of some razor sharp dialogue and some extremely talented actors mouthing them. Limaye, Ingle and Shrotri are in top form, looking and feeling like their characters all the way. True, they almost seem to walk around with signboards bearing their character sketches on it, but that in part adds to the charm of it, the fact that at least the director didn’t hold back on how far over the top he was taking the things.Yet, it feels like a promising film that went unfulfilled. The concept and narrative technique needed a more evolved vision and guiding hand to take it to fruition; the will to hold back when required and to go all out when the need arose; the realization that such an opportunity, material like this, might not arise tomorrow, so why not make the most of it now.Badam Rani Gulam Chor is the kind of film that, had it been treated right, would have made for an intimate, stimulating watch, a home video cult. As it stands, it is a series of smart-and-silly laughs that would make for passable weekend viewing on the tube or a family outing at the theatres.

Does time elapsed justify forgiving a crime? Is revenge futile? Does it become justified because of the first wrong done? Is a cold-blooded crime less justifiable than one committed in the heat of the moment? Does your justification depend on the justification of the criminal? Is forgiveness less palatable when done by a criminal? You might have your answers to all these questions, but the ambiguity will remain. They are, after all, only “yours”. Your “justifiable” will different from mine. The point is, Badlapur makes you think about where you've drawn the line. Even if not entirely convincing. In that sense, Badlapur pushes the boundaries of a regular Hindi thriller film. We all know its going to go one way or the other – the wronged is going to either take revenge or not.  Badlapur makes you reconsider what and how much your conscience will  allow even if you are not in the judge's seat. But, it involves a leap of faith from your side.We make allowances for films that we begin to like while watching them or the ones we want to like. But very often, the story jerks in a way that you don't quite get. Badlapur did that to me with its character transformations. Sure, they are unpredictable and the unexpected is seldom unexciting. But unpredictable change towards something that was built up for over an hour of screen time doesn't convince you. For me that and the one passage of time  were deal-breakers.  Especially, a short scene just explains it off asking characters and audience to introspect. As a film, a story, Badlapur makes you think of it as a convenient contrivance. As a concept though the film stays with you and it is not only because of the intensity of the violence. If you take what happens as a given you will find yourself mulling over it in circular thoughts. And that is Badlapur's success. You are with the film after the 2+ hours in the theater. The actors stay with you for long after. Nawazuddin Siddiqui makes you laugh in the darkest moments to go with the noir tone of the film. The character and the actor compliment each other perfectly, as can be said about every character that the man plays. So used to his class act are we, that the one thing that I'll remember Badlapur by is Varun Dhawan's performance. It might be a cakewalk for a good actor to play a brooder/sulker. But, Varun Dhawan carries it off while drawin sympathy from the audience. You almost feel like telling him to let go of his anger for his own sake. Huma Qureshi plays aloof and concerned all at once exactly like her character would be in her place. All others in their bit roles from Vinay Pathak to Radhika Apte to Ashwini Kalsekar and Divya Dutta keep the film very rooted. Their expressions and body language make you believe what their character feels. But you might or might not be convinced of what the character feels in the first place. I am slightly ambivalent about the pace of the film too. Not that the slow build-up was an issue, but I can't help but think how the dynamics would have changed had the film lingered a little less and stayed crisp as one has come to accept of a thriller. Starting with a philosophy ""The axe forgets. The tree remembers."", Badlapur obviously aims at being a psychological thriller. Unfortunately, it neither is whole-heartedly psychological nor a thriller. Even though it makes you introspect your attitude towards crime and justice.

Everyone gets their just desserts and surprisingly all ends well.","Remember the Hindi movies of the 70s? The villain would be a moneyed sleazebag whose ill-gotten gains were the result of his smuggling activities. As the decades rolled by and the Indian politico-commercial environment changed, the smuggler was relegated to the role of a side-character, often the comic relief who would explain his livelihood as ‘import-export ka business’ accompanied by a shifty-eyed look and knowing nudges from those who knew what that was a euphemism for. More than a decade later, Bollywood takes us on another tour of the psyche of this interesting character referred to as the ‘smuggler’. Badmaash Company is a story of four people who board the express train of get-rich-quick schemes and where it takes them. A number of dubious schemes and their execution keep the audience entertained during the first half. At this juncture, I did wonder whether the director had run out of steam and if the movie would falter once the crime-gags were done.In the second half, the story turns to the characters themselves and their relationships with each other. The movie transitioned well from witty to a somber ending. The slight Dil Chahta Hainesque note (the Badmaash Company is actually called ‘Friends & Co.’) is concluded quite neatly. By the end, it more like a coming of age story. Shahid Kapoor essays the transition from a starry-eyed youngster to a cocky, hardened man-of-the-world with subtle grace. The potential glimpsed in Jab We Met and Kaminey comes into its own with this movie.Badmaash Company is contemporary in that the protagonist is shown in grey shades instead of the stark moralistic caricatures that were shown in movies made in 90s. Most people of this generation will be able to identify with the clash of attitudes with the earlier generation, the burning ambition and quest for fame, power and money, the disillusionment and even the peace that the characters make with each other and their choices.Despite the multiple issues that Badmaash Company seeks to address, it is quite light and easy to watch. Real-life witticisms like ethnic jokes, pop feminism and friendly banter (digs at movie stardom dreams) keep us grinning as the story unfolds. After the long dark teatime of the cinemagoer’s soul on account of the IPL, Badmaash Company comes as a welcome shout back into the theatres.

Too superficial for smaller town audiences to find believable.,"Hearts in the right places and good causes and a message in the film can take a film only so far. It still needs solid continuity, logical flow and a decent amount of believability. Because the message of “not accepting dowry” or “no showing a woman her place but having it for her as default” falls flat when adamant chauvinists change their beliefs before you could bat your eye. If only things were so easy, if only.I assume the makers didn't want us to “keep our brains at home” for this one. Some might claim that is an unfair assumption. In that case then, the message and attempt to make an impact is lip-service. The writing is way too weak for the film to have any impact at all. Scenes linger, and not in a good way. The film takes too long to say what it want to stay. While the main characters have grey streaks, the side characters are too stereotypical. While I didn't find a laugh in some supposedly funny situations - how is rape funny? -  it is difficult to appreciate the few laughs you get in the first half because of missing details. The lapse in logic is distracting. For example, our hero doesn't know the formula for simple interest. But, can the character really be blamed? The writer-director doesn't seem to have their Math together. Who pays the dowries for the two daughters doesn't add up? No one seems to be bothered about the cost of the lavish wedding. These are the exact things that would bother a person who has actually gone through the process of organizing a wedding. Let's not even get into the mumbo-jumbo that Badrinath's sister-in-law gives as financial advice. It boggles the mind. All that time, energy and effort spent on making a film, and no one could approach the film's accountant to give them a decent two lines? Let alone the fact that she said it all so fast, she might as well have been saying, “MutualFundinvestmentsaresubjecttomarketrisks. PleasereadtheOfferDocumentcarefullybeforeinvesting.”The other actors do play their parts alright, but the thick accents seem too put-on. It is difficult to believe that Varun Dhawan or Alia Bhatt have grown up with that background. Their performances are not bad at all. However, knowing what they are capable of, his performance came across as too generic and Alia in fact felt a little too shrill. Sure, the attempt at being progressive is obvious. But Badrinath Ki Dulhania seems to go about it rather lazily – taking the simplest “next steps” without a introspective and/or an exploratory eye at, what real life dowry cases or cases where a woman is held down, look like.

The sets look exotic, the cinematography is breathtaking. The entire set-up is extravagant. There is one long, awesomely choreographed war sequence. And that's it. It is a 2 hour  40 minute long film. It has unnecessary songs that in fact, seemed cheesy to me - and this I felt after a long time. The story has some thing going about it, but it runs out of steam and/or money by the time the climax approaches. Given this list of pros and cons, it finally boils down to whether or not you can watch and like a film mostly for its scale and visuals. Bahubali might have still been worth recommending if it were not for major plot points left hanging before  “the conclusion” was declared. There were at least two sub-plots that were dwelt on through out the film, but weren't explained at all, let alone satisfactorily. I also wonder, if the film would've worked better if it avoided the flashback and pasted the “history” before the current times instead of moving back and forth. A chronological telling of the story might have worked better in building the story. But, from the way it has ended up, looks like the story didn't feature in the top ten priorities. It was more like the idea of shooting a great war scene came about and a story was conceptualised to justify the big war.  A story that makes you feel it was reverse engineered, isn't what I like in my films. The rest is secondary. ~ ~ ~ps: I watched the version dubbed in Hindi.

In the latter, the story matters even less. It is the scale, the action, the special effects that the film is shooting for and achieves. ","Each frame of the film is exquisite - each one grand enough for you to stare at and admire for a long time. For that reason alone, Bahubali 2 could make for a theater watch – especially if all you want to consume, is the scale. For the rest of us though, who want story, minimal coherence, etc, we have no business loitering around in the general area where this film is playing.The latter part of the audience, meanwhile can amuse themselves by playing, “Which profile picture defines Bahubali (Prabhas) better? The one of him dreamily sitting on a tree or the majestic one on a throne or the one with him fighting the enemy's army with a tree trunk.” In the first half, you could also ponder over questions like, “Why did Kattappa (Sathyaraj) not get killed by Bahubali in episode 1?” Yeah, he annoys that bad. However, the first half also takes a step towards showing women as strong characters. The action sequences don't sexualise Devsena (Anushka Shetty), but are rather matter-of-factly. Also,  both the women, Devsena and Sivagami (Ramya Krishnan) – right or wrong – hold their ground. In fact, it is ironical that a film that is mostly set in a time before Bahubali – The Beginning, the women are treated with a lot more respect than they were by the next generations. The eve-teasing bit is given a solid, brash treatment that it deserves too. However, as the film tries to patch its way to “The Beginning”, you wonder what ever happened to the valiant, warrior princessIn all other ways though, the film continues what it starts in the first installment. Lots of action, so much so that by the end, the clinking of swords seems like background score. Some of it is brutal, even if done artistically or even lyrically. Unfortunately, it gently slides into amusing and then ludicrous. Look at any tree or animal around you and push your wilde imagination to use it as a weapon of mass destruction! The romance continues too, where clouds double as horses and flowers, soldiers turn into dancers and so on. That is all you expected from this film and that is what you get in abudnance. The actors join in, in the continuity with Ramya Krishnan as “She who doesn't blink” and Prabhas who is equally determined and passionate whether he is a noble warrior or a make-shift engineer. The expressions don't change. Rana Daggubati and Sathyaraj need add no new dimension to their character either. The only refereshing change is that of Anushka Shetty. This is of course, because the screenplay demands little variation. Bahubali has a broad Mahabharat-esque story. But without any of its complexities. Because all the screen time is taken over by dramatic slo-mo entry and loud background music. There isn't much room to bring in nuances and unfortunately, neither did the makers feel the need. But that is for the handful in the audience like me. The visuals are mesmerizing. You get an inkling of the scale as the censor board certificate is followed by an endless list of partners. The patient wait for the film to actually begin is well worth it. The opening credit sequence itself made me wish I had opted for the IMAX tickets, even if it was double the price. As I saw the film progress, I didn't think I would have regretted the decision, though I didn't mind saving the ₹250 – because ultimately, the want for a solid story always dominates. ~ ~ ~ps: I watched the version dubbed in Hindi.

But the manner in which all the characters are written or even presented, the film appears to be lacking enough conviction to create a long-lasting impact. Baji definitely had every potential to be one of the finest films of the year so far, yet it comes across as a dim-witted one – leaving you in a state of sulky dissatisfaction.Easily one of those films that are big on a strong idea, Baji falls short of enough strong voice to invoke your emotions or keep you engrossed throughout. Having impressed in his debut feature Pune 52, I was very curious to see what director Nikhil Mahajan does next. And Baji’s promising trailer added to my mounting expectations. While I wasn’t hoping for an out-and-out superhero film, I surely thought Baji  would push the envelope at least in terms of storytelling. But never in my wildest dreams did I imagine it would pave the way to mediocrity.The film is about an 11th-century legend of a masked man, who protects the dusty village of Shrirangpur. His strange disappearance for years makes the villagers wonder if this man ever really existed. But there is some mystery surrounding his existence that bridges the present world with the legend. This does sound extremely interesting; sadly all the excitement remains only on the paper (if any). It is formulaic and the shoddy writing makes it walk the path of regular potboilers.The writer-director wastes significant amount of runtime introducing characters in appealing ways, ultimately hampering the bigger picture. After an indie film, Mahajan seemingly couldn’t resist the urge of making a big-budget drama full of mindless lip-sync songs. Instead of advancing the story, the choreographed dance sequences relatively obstruct its natural progression. This leads to sluggish narrative and stretches the film to an extravagant almost 3-hours.Pune 52 had its fair share of weaknesses, but Mahajan managed to impress with his original voice. He doesn’t appear to have learnt from his mistakes though. He takes his slip-ups to another level instead. Clichéd screenplay doesn't open up any room for improvement, let alone its strikingly predictable nature. One of the several takeaways from his previous film was long sequences in a single, continuous shot. Baji deeply misses the absence of such shots.The director’s over-reliance on old-fashioned action scenes, over-the-top camerawork and dismal production values ruin his own execution in a big way. He overlooks novelty when it is neeed in some of the crucial moments. Also, the use of repetitive visuals to drive the point home was totally uncalled for. Abhijit Deshpande’s editing lets down time and again.Baji is quite contrary to Pune 52’s minimalistic, natural-looking lighting approach, making it appear needlessly stylistic at various points. Post interval, almost the entire village appears to be wearing black clothes for some unexplained reasons. I doubt if that really adds any symbolic value to the story.Shreyas Talpade plays Chidu’s goofy character with utmost honesty; however Jitendra Joshi’s outright baddy Martand stays with you. These two brilliant actors are pitted against each other, and they try their best to uplift a poorly-written film. The cameos of directors Ravi Jadhav and Nagraj Manjule were completely unconvincing. Run-of-the-mill fight sequences, loud sound and tacky visual effects fail miserably to generate the much-needed goriness. This results in an ordinary hero-villain film.Baji is certainly not awful, but it is definitely not something you would want Mahajan to do after Pune 52.

The film is good too. ","“One person can be in love with two people at the same time.” “Women are empowered and can hold their own.”  “Religion shouldn't be the basis for love or war.” - Each one of these is a bold theme for one film to take on by itself.  Bajirao Mastani takes it all on together and does justice to all of them. Film aside, I am in awe that these themes were picked up in real life, a few centuries ago. I hope this is how it all happened. I hope this is how Bajirao Peshwa was – not only a valiant leader, but also stood up for his women and when necessary stood up against them too; fought his wars but was absolutely clear about why he was fighting them – not for religion. I wonder when we regressed. I wonder what problem anyone would have in believing that the man and the women were as they were portrayed here. aso (so be it.)Such strong personalities - each one of them. Once you get over the each-frame-a-beautiful-canvas visuals that are typical of Bhansali films, you are taken over by the characters. The frames stay beautiful, of course, just that the three main leads weave an interesting web. Mastani (Deepika Padukone), the strong-willed woman consumed by love – yes some women are like that, then and now. Bajirao (Ranveer Singh), known as India's greatest warrior also fell in love and not just once, his vulnerability exposed ever-so slightly. And Kashibai (Priyanka Chopra) – wow! What a lady! Hurting yet holding her pride. Priyanka Chopra is an easy winner in this one. Maybe she is relegated to the background for most of the film. But in a couple of “her” scenes – she makes you forget it is her and holds you in awe of Kashibai where you feel her pain too. Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh come across as just pretty people when held against her. They do well, but you begin to notice how after a point they have to hold just one expression. Ranveer Singh overacts a tad bit and has an inconsistent accent. Not that these lapses are intolerable but they make you wonder how much better the performance would have been without. There were other things that took away from the film. Like the songs, especially the one with the Peshwa celebrating. No, whether or not they happened all those years ago, whether or not it offends anyone - at least one or two of them should've been cut out – they should've stayed out because they just made the film longer. There were times when the film came across as a saas-bahu1 soap opera, but I guess this was a family drama of its own kind. The time lapses were distracting too. Too many times, the narrative moved from one character to another without a smooth flow. Looks like Mr. Bhansali had a lot more shot and had to be cruel on the editing table. Another distraction came with the Marathi words thrown in, isn't it just fine that they are speaking in Hindi in a Hindi film?  Then there was the preachy closing – why-o-why?Of course, even when put together these aberrations are not huge enough to take away from what's good about the film. Magnificent visuals apart, Bajirao Mastani might be a version of history that I wish is true. ~ ~ ~1 TV soap operas revolving around petty family politics.

Yet, film too long to do justice to a theater outing.","How many times have you tried to do the right thing but have been bogged down by the trouble it will entail? And the times that might have crossed your mind would be a traffic violation or a tricky one in a social situation. Here we have Bajrangi (Salman Khan) - who is a vegetarian Hindu brahman (cast of the priests), who lives by some of the rules Lord Hanuman set for himself – in charge of a 6 year old girl, who not only eats non-vegetarian, but is also a Muslim; who is not only a Muslim, but is from Pakistan! Director, Kabir Khan has tried to sensitize the audience to an issue that is not easy to approach. But, other than that the film takes way too long to tell its tale, which makes a trip to the theater not worth the buck or the time. It does take some amount of bravado to show a person kissing a Pakistan flag and cheering for the Pakistan cricket team. The message of love between the two nations is a valuable one and a very important one too. Fortunately, it is not shoved down your throat like a sermon. Bajrangi Bhaijaan sticks to the narrative and says what it wants to say through the narrative. Now, the way it goes about its business is too simplified. I am an optimist and a romantic and would love to see it happen but there is just no way, any one is crossing the India-Pakistan border in either direction under the army's eye, let alone without a visa AND passport – just because they see the goodness of the heart.  And Salman Khan plays the good-naturedness believably. In fact, the one thing that the film tries to push with all its might is how good Salman Khan is. It does help that  Bajrangi Bhaijaan doesn't have the usual trappings of a Salman Khan film – the smart-aleckry, the action sequences, the signature Salman expressions – basically, Bajrangi Bhaijaan doesn't have an overdose of Salman Khan. In fact, if someone were to ask me what the film is about, I'd first say loving solution to India-Pakistan border issues. Then little Harshaali Malhotra, the child actress, who knows a thing or two about acting already. And only then would I think of it as a Salman Khan film.  Oh and Kareena Kapoor was barely even a prop. So, were the song and dance sequences. Breath-taking cinematography of the Himalayas aside, these things made the film just too long. Maybe, the melodrama gets you a little involved with Shahida (Harshaali Malhotra) getting home, but the balance tips to the wrong side with the elongated drama. I wonder if the traits the film banks on - innocence and good-natured honesty – would have had a better impact if it were not diluted by this drama. Even so, if the film manages to sensitize even a fraction of a percent of Salman fans to treating people from the other country with compassion, it would have done its job.  If only that were the solution to world problems that are only getting worse by the decade – being good, or being human even.~ ~ ~ps. I really question a child actor being made to play a scene in a brothel. I admit the setting didn't really have any thing to suggest it is a brother if taken by itself. Hopefully, she didn't know anything about the sequence.  But, what when she sees the film?

38,136,136,136,136,Balak Palak,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review5 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/balak-palak-review/,,5/5.0,,4.6,"Ravi Jadhav’s Balak-Palak is a film that deals with one of the most sensitive issues that adolescents go through; it is the kind of film that just might get parents and children to start opening up to each other. With some excellent performances led by five children who steal the show, BP is a film I would strongly recommend that families watch together.","Children are curious; there is no escaping this fact. And parents, no matter how they were as children themselves, will always try to protect their children from what they believe is bad for them. Of course, ‘good’ and ‘bad’ are constructs whose definitions are as varied as the personalities of the people defining them. Acclaimed director Ravi Jadhav’s latest offering, Balak-Palak, or BP, deals with this important facet of ‘growing up’ in a manner that is lucid, charming, honest and so much more.  BP takes a peek into the lives of five young children; five friends growing up in a ‘chawl’, their adolescent curiosity, their escapades in this regard and the eventual effect that this has on their friendship and their respective relationships. With some genuinely insightful moments peppered with just the right amount of humour, BP is one of those films that touch your heart, without ever getting tedious or heavy.What the film also cleverly does is touch upon a sensitive subject without ever making the audience squeamish or uncomfortable. In fact, the film talks about a subject that parents and children never seem to talk about, but does it in a manner that will appeal to children and adults alike. As the title of the film does give a hint about what the film is about, I’ll refrain from going into it; I’d rather you discover it for yourselves, if you don’t already know.The film is helped immensely by the performances of the ensemble cast. The film features known names in Marathi cinema like Subodh Bhave, Amruta Subhash, Anand Ingale, Sai Tamhankar and Kishore Kadam. All of them are excellent, without exception. But all of them only have cameos. They are merely side players, aimed more at supporting the real heroes and heroines of the film – the children.Prathamesh Parab (Vishu), Rohit Phalke (Avya), Shashwati Pimplikar (Dolly), Bhagyashree Shankpal (Chiu) and Madan Deodhar (Bhagya) are the pillars of this film. BP, after all, is about the search for answers to the questions that these children have, their friendships, their views and their lives. All five of them are extremely talented; their spontaneity is the soul of this film. Also, their characters have been written so convincingly that you leave the film carrying them away as your own friends (or children, if that is the case.) Ravi Jadhav has to be lauded for clearly putting the children at enough ease to make them lose their inhibitions in front of the camera.If director Ravi Jadhav is responsible for the children being the soul of the film, then cinematographer Mahesh Limaye deserves a pat on his back for giving the soul a body that can hold its own visually; in fact, rarely has a Marathi film looked so good. Beautiful frames combine with the earthy sepia tone to deliver a film that looks good enough for the makers to be proud of. Special mention must also be made of the music, which gels with the film nicely. It is heartening to see Vishal-Shekhar working on Marathi films as well – they’ve done some of the songs in this film.Surprisingly, some of my few problems with this film lie in the area where the film is actually quite strong – the writing. While the film’s simple, clean story and screenplay are excellent, I wish the film had focused some more on the parents’ side of the story. Yes, the film tries to convey that parents were also children once. But the parents of the children whose story we see are hardly ever shown in the film. I walked away wishing I’d known what they had gone through. Also, the film tries hard to avoid being preachy, but invariably does end up being so in the end. Another small niggle lies in the sound – the dialogue often (but not always) has an accompanying background hiss to it that distracts, perhaps because of problems in recording sync sound.One of the reasons why I had cut back on the number of Marathi films I watch in the theatre is the fact that there seemed to be one new release every week, with mediocrity become somewhat of a norm amongst them. BP, thankfully, rises above that. It made me smile throughout, and it often made the audience I watched the film with laugh out loud. This is the kind of film that I’d insist a family – parents and their children – watch together.

39,137,137,137,137,Balkadu,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review,/movie/balkadu-review/,,,,4.6,A tried-and-tested formula laced with mind-numbing efforts. Nothing to write home about.,"Edward Dmytryk once said, ""In art, the obvious is a sin."" Director Atul Kale probably doesn’t understand what it really means. Had that not been the case, Balkadu wouldn’t have seen the light of day. But now that this film is released, and you are in the theater you have no other option but to suffer the fruits of his sins. To put it in even simpler words – Kale falls into that brigade of directors who have no idea of anything, let alone making a film.Balkadu is an outright propaganda-driven film. Well, this is no big news to you (considering it is the lone reason the film exists) and nothing is flawed about that either. Take any well-made propaganda film for an instance; an intriguing narrative is woven around its one-sided, ideological message. It misleads you without even letting you know about it. And that’s the beauty of writing, something the film’s writers bluntly overlook in every single moment. But does it have at least something to brag about? A big no, unfortunately.Balkrushna Patil, who left Bombay in his teens to live in a less expensive locality – Nala Sopara, teaches history at an English-medium school that doesn’t look like one. He hears voices of several Indian freedom fighters and political leaders. He sees a psychiatrist to beat this trouble, but one of the voices refuses to go away. All the unbelievable thereby starts happening. The voiceover of late Balasaheb Thackeray helps this underdog overcome his fears and stand against our corrupt system.Sounds familiar? Oh yes, it does. The film takes cues heavily from Me Shivajiraje Bhosale Boltoy, or sometimes even Lage Raho Munnabhai. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Mahatma Gandhi come alive in the aforesaid, respective films; while here Balasaheb’s voiceover (the only apparent difference) single-handedly guides a common man do the impossible. Balkadu, regrettably, appears to be a ditto copycat of Me Shivajiraje Bhosale Boltoy in many ways the film ends up being ludicrous tough. What annoys me more is that Kale is seldom bothered with putting any effort to recite the same story a little differently.The makers definitely seemed to be in the mood of making things more impactful than meaningful. Okay, one can excuse logic for the sake of story. This film, however, has none. Just like Balasaheb’s stiff but rib-tickling words, the film boasts some really powerful dialogues at times. He was considered as the man who says what he thought and does what he says. Being based on his ideologies, the film’s story (if there’s any) could have at least acted in a similar way. The outcome is rather otherwise. Because the words need the backing of action, right? Yet I have to admit this, well-timed (although excessively used) comedy is the only saving grace of this haplessly mediocre film. Irrespective of whether you agree or disagree with the portrayal of pro-Marathi agenda in Balkadu. The camerawork is something you can’t forgive anytime soon. This film is about Bombay and it fails to capture the core elements that truly define the city. It instead focuses on pointless things, just as the film’s editing or production do.I feel, I was needlessly harsh about Umesh Kamat’s casting after seeing Balkadu’s trailer. Yes; he does go a little over-the-top, yet he manages a decent job.Balkadu has everything that can be termed as superficial; even so most of the theatre was laughing, clapping or whistling at regular intervals. This reminds me of Singham. Audiences always go gaga about underdogs shaking the system. If you root for such underdogs or stand by Balasaheb’s philosophy, chances are high that you already love the film.

40,138,138,138,138,Band Baaja Baaraat,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review52 Critic Reviews 4.0/5.0 10 Reader Reviews 4/5.0 235 Tweet Reviews 4.7/5.0,/movie/band-baaja-baaraat-review/,4.0/5.0,4/5.0,4.7/5.0,4.233333333,Band Baaja Baaraathas umpteen points where a viewer could suggest changes to make it a better film BUT that doesn't make it a bad one. The super-basic plot looks naïve but has nice facets of a man-woman relationship built into it.,"Sure, Band Baaja Baaraat is the same old story. The lead lady is a woman of essence, who takes on the world face up but you can't miss the gaping need for a man in her life. The male lead is yet another confused young man, who is a symbol of the talented but directionless youth. For newbies working together on a business, they hardly go through a struggle. Everything is laid out for her all too easily. YET you warm up to them.  You feel a shimmer of happiness for them when they are together. You want to tell them off for being silly when they are fighting with each other. I detested Band Baaja Baaraat's overall escape to over-simplicity and I loved it for the slight details of an every-day relationship. ""falling in love"" is beneath her, that's what regular girls do, not Shruti (Anushka Sharma). And yet, she savors special moments she has spent with her friend. She is modern and simple-minded. And yet, this doesn't come across as contradictory. Bittoo (Ranveer Singh) hasn't thought much about his aspirations. All he knows is he doesn't want to join his family business. Whatever keeps him away from that becomes his aspiration. Her rule for life becomes his rule, without a rhyme or reason. Because that's how he is. And things pretty much stay that way. She remains adamant and foolhardy. He doesn't budge from his foolish self. Their misunderstanding or bickering is commonplace in real life. Which is why, their actions and reactions are from your standard boy meets girl story, but they don't seem out of place. The same simple-headedness mars the film too. The agonizing conflict in the film doesn't hit hard enough because the heavy ""business"" set-up. Business mixes with pleasure. The set-up is all about Shruti's business, but the conflict arises elsewhere. Yet, you are interested in what's going on because of some very witty dialogues delivered with just the attitude the characters are meant to portray. Neither Anushka nor Ranveer have ""screen presence"". They could both look their best and deliver the most endearing lines, and I could very well be enjoying it without looking at them but observing the props in the background. And this works in their favor. Band Baaja Baaraat leaves a warm feeling without any overt stylization or grand charisma. In fact, Ranveer's pictures in the promo posters make him look like the roadside romeo, a girl would avoid looking at. And that's how he is in the film. Either this is perfect casting or a brilliant performance or ofcourse an intelligent blend of the two, only his next few films will tell. Though Anushka is a couple of movie old, this is her first one with no ""star""-backup. A couple more roles where she has a role with substance like this one and I think we'll have something to look forward to every time she picks a script. You hear of a movie titled Band Baaja Baaraat produced by the best marriage scene creators in the market, Yash Raj Films and apprehension builds into a cringe. You go into the theater expecting a garish set-up with an over-zealous background score. The first few scenes are of a texture so different from your expectations that you have no choice but to sit-up and notice. It's not gloss, it is the ruggedness of a street. The street is soon decorated but in an earthy, believable fashion. Are we seeing Yash Raj turn over a leaf in its hunky-dory, big, fat wedding environment? There is a glimpse. If not in anything else, in their new venture's awesome logo film. (I tried to look it up but couldn’t find it. It plays before Band Baaja Baaraat starts. I'll update this space if I locate and leave me a link if you find it. Thanks!)

Action-packed, lots of Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif, passable stunt and close to no story.","You have to grant that Bang Bang delivers what it promises in the trailers. Lots of action, just about tolerable stunts, a bit of coochie-coo between the incredibly good-looking lead pair and lots of on-screen time for the two, individually and together - all of it pretty much mindless, with no attempt at creating any interest in the plot itself.Some of the stunts do look cool, especially for those of us who are not exposed to enough Hollywood. That seems to be Bang Bang's first selling point - Bang Bang, the machine gun kind and not the other kind that the movie itself admits there isn't enough of. You have the works - bikes, cars, race cars even, choppers, boats, water skis and what not. You have Hrithik Roshan flying down buildings and cliffs and emerging up from the deep seas. But, you know they are there just for the sake of being there. More of the ""cool"" idea leading to its insertion in the film rather than the story requiring the creativity of the cool idea. Pretty much same goes for the film's second selling point - Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif - the gorgeous looking people that they are, they supposedly don't require character devlopment, depth or even a half-decent story or even decent chemistry. Just the presense of the actors ought to keep the audience happy. For the sake of completeness, then I will mention the most obvious - their abdominal muscles certainly worked out more than the facial muscles. Body language? Baah! Who needs that when you have the body? Any attempt at injecting emotion then, seems farcical. Not that emotion has much of a place in this film. So what, if it's has patriotism at its chore and wants to be a revenge drama. You'd think there would be a little more room for good song and dance in a film like this, especially given Hrithink Roshan's presence. But that too is too much to ask for. Just in case, you are still wondering, the entire plot is pretty much pointless given the ""twist"" in the climax. Since the film then has no  more selling points, it resorts to blatant product placements so much so that after Krrish 3 now, I have started associating Hrithik Roshan with product placement. And yet, I can't completely put the film down. At least, true-blue action stunts are being attempted. They might not have been executed well, but hopefully it will get better with the next film or the next. Meanwhile, though this is meant for some other long weekend, one which has the film running on TV with the luxury of flipping channels.

42,140,140,140,140,Bangalore Days,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/bangalore-days-review/,,5/5.0,,3.266666667,Anjali Menon’s Bangalore Days is a youthful film with some beautiful writing. The solid cast makes the film a lovely little journey. ,"There are two kinds of ‘predictability’ you come across when you’re watching a film. The first, more commonly occurring type, is when you absolutely know where the story is headed, because the writer and director had no imagination while scripting and making the film; the ‘yawn’ kind of the predictability. The second, which is so rare, particularly in our films, is when your characters are so well etched out that there is really no other step the person would have taken when faced with a particular situation. It doesn’t jar; it just feels, for want of a better word, natural.I was pleasantly surprised, then, when Anjali Menon’s Bangalore Days had a lot of the second kind of predictability. Now if you look at the run-time of the film - just a shade under 3 hours – you wonder why a film that is about young people and by inference, targeted primarily at young people, would be so long. (We’ve reached a stage where not many have that kind of an attention span, and most films hover around the 2 – 2.5 hour mark.) The answer, again, lies in the characterization. The characters are given room to breathe, explore and discover themselves. Bangalore Days, thus, surprised me on multiple levels. The three main characters, Arjun, Divya and Krishnan (fondly called Kuttetan), are cousins. Extremely close to each other while growing up in Kerala, they always promised each other that they’d go to Bangalore when they were older. As it turns out, their life takes them exactly there; and their journey is something truly worth sharing.Handled with a surprising amount of patience and maturity, we get involved in each of their stories equally. Newly-married Divya’s problems with a reticent husband – the fourth important character in the film; Kuttetan’s yearning for a simple, Malayali girl who’ll make him happy; and the nomad Arjun’s journey towards internal stability; each of these tales could have been a story in itself. Put together, though, it makes for a soul-stirring ride. Because not only is each of the characters written well, but their relationships with each other have also been crafted with love. They stand by each other, fight, make up and pull each other along beautifully.Yes, the film has its share of ‘twists’ that seem a tad out of place. But one way to look at them is to find out how our primary characters will deal with them. So what eventually make the twists work is the fact that they tie in with the lives of the characters beautifully. The film is also about little moments, little deft touches which add a wonderful texture to the story. I don’t want to give anything away, but these little moments show that a lot of thought went into putting the film down on paper. Insight into human behaviour and relationships, a love for the little flourishes of life, and genuine fondness and affection for the characters being written. Yes, some of these moments would be classified as ‘filmy’; but they all have one origin – the writer-director’s heart. The icing, then, is the cast. Cute-as-a-button Nazriya as Divya charms you. The fact that her husband, known through most of the film as Das, is played by her wonderfully talented real life fiancé Fahadh Faasil, gives their story that added zing. Nivin Pauly as Kuttetan has a sweet, bumbling presence. And young Dulquer Salman, who plays Arjun, is a star. The screen presence and confidence is in his genes, of course, but he’s also a solid actor – a talent that cannot be taken for granted even if your father is Mammootty.Bangalore Days is one of the most honest films I’ve seen in a while. The effort put into the film manifests itself in ways that can’t strictly be quantified. The film is well shot as well, and has some really nice music. Bangalore, a city that I personally love, is also beautifully captured in the film. It seems so long since we’ve met characters who we fall in love with and walk with while they fall in love themselves. Bangalore Days offers you just that.

The satire is witty too. But then, what? Nothing beyond the concept really. Also, does satire always have to be preachy?","Bangistan's trailer has already set-up the film for you. You know two suicide bombers out there are targeting the same religion conference. You know, they are exchanging religions, though you don't know why they need to do that. The movie doesn't make that clearer - which is a smaller issue considering the movie wants to talk about how beneath different dressing styles all religions are the same. We are all the same. We also know before the movie begins that this is all said in good humor, with satire. The film then has nothing new to say beyond this.The satire wanes off in the first few minutes. After the initial America bashing while consuming products of corporate America, there is a mind-warping change of identities which lends to the satire for a bit. But after that there is nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, the performances too, stick to the usual format of over-the-top that seems to be a pre-requisite for satirical Hindi films. Riteish Deshmukh does try to bring in a bit of seriousness but then his character's seriousness seems like a misfit in the setting. Except this difference though Pulkit Samrat and Riteish Deshmukh's character are only clones of each other. And just in case you are wondering, Jacquiline Fernandes is barely a prop in the two and a half minutes she has on screen. Bangistan is one of those ideas that is really cool. But when you expand it into a 2+ hour film it tends to get repetitive. This is not to say there cannot be a film with this idea that could work, but then that would be a different film. As it stands, the only change that has the potential to make the film a must watch is to cut it short to about 85-90 minutes. Which is why it might be an okay watch while you are surfing channelsBangistan made me realise the connection between satire and preachiness. Almost all satire has a “holier-than-thou” air about it that the parent-humor sarcasm carries. It is in a way talking down to its target audience. Except, that audience isn't even listening or will see through both the sarcasm and the lesson.

Else, very passable.","Banjo is the regular underdog drama, in the music sphere. It is even below average in its story arc, setup-build up-climax and so on. But, it makes up with its music. Now, can one watch a movie for the energetic visuals of songs (about 20 minutes of screen time)? I guess almost all of us will have the same answer.Now, for any film that is about a slum-dweller wanting to make it big, we know how the story is going to progress. We aren't really expecting any great deviations from the norm. Banjo's unpredictability unfortunately comes from the fact that the expected takes too long to happen. The first half hardly moves. We know Chris (Nargis Fakhri) is looking for Tarrat (Riteish Deshmukh) from the trailers to participate in a music competition. She just keeps looking for a long, long time. The digressions in the form of their love story or Chris/Tarrat's jobs or Tarrat's relationship with his band-mates all are rather lacklustre. In addition, some of them slow the pace down further. Almost all of the handful of funny lines are seen in the trailer. So, there is nothing to look forward to there either. For a flash of a moment, when a newspaper delivery boy aspires to be a water tanker owner or when Tarrat expresses the kind of love he is capable of, you are hopeful for more moments of decent writing. But, naah, nothing of the sort happens. Instead the film is littered with scenes like Mumbai dwellers ogling at women in short dresses and men in ties with equal enthusiasm - as if they've never seen either before, Riteish Deshmukh beating people up and so on. There isn't anything very moving or engaging in the acting department either. Riteish Deshmukh does the drunk bit, the macho beating up goon bit, the love-struck bit in rhythm – one after the other. While performances by the other band members are full of energy, Nargis Fakhri loses you at her dialogue delivery itself. It is painful to watch her speak Hindi. And for all the hue and cry about creating music together, her character has all of three lines to sing. Which brings us back to the the gaping hole in the writing department. It is not about plausibility or loopholes, that discussion can come only later - only after there is some meat in the plot, the situations, the scenes. I can't but admit that I am a tad disappointed. This music deserved a better film. For a film that wants to glorify the banjo, it is disappointing to see the banjo player set aside the instrument to dance within a few seconds of its introduction. The flip side is that when you hear the instrument play, complete justice is done to the music it can create.

Similar needs put all three lead players on a bumpy quest of fulfilling their dreams. Laced with very strong performances,"What does a person wish in his life - love, money, respect or all of this? Every common man wishes for all of this and these wishes are what Barah Aana basically talks about. Needs, desires and  dreams bring people together but they also test trust and sanity.These aspirations bring the three lead players of this story together. Each one has his own dreams and needs, and is working hard to meet them. But, with one incident, their approach to life not only changes  but also exposes the darker side of their quests. This is a dark comedy about the lives of common people and director, Raja Menon, handles it deftly. Though his debut film, Bas Yun Hi sunk without trace, with this film Menon proves that he is an accomplished storyteller. The problem, though, is with the story he has decided to tell. It doesn’t have the bite to grip you. The screenplay is decent enough to keep you guessing, but the movie gives you a feeling of incompleteness. The dialogues are crisp and witty, and sometimes even howlarious. It is that kind of a movie, where after watching it, you take back few incidents and performances and not the movie as a whole.  Menon has superbly cast his three protagonists. Vijay Raaz is the utter face of the common man. His body language, his expressions and his dialogue delivery are as perfect as always. He will remind you of every third person you see walking on the street. One knew that Arjun Mathur has talent after watching him in Farhan Akhtar’s short film Positive and in the recent Luck By Chance. Barah Aana only supplements this fact.
Naseeruddin Shah is his usual self - Brilliant! Raja Menon, makes  the veteran's character speak his first word only in the second half of the film, but still makes the audience whistle out loud at every body movement of the super-actor. The title signifies the three-quarters and not the full worth awarded to the efforts of a common man. It's the same with the movie. It does not rise up to its full worth and is disappointing as the film could have delivered a lot. But it’s a decent watch nonetheless.

That’s Baran for you, acclaimed Irani film-maker Majid Majidi’s most well-known dash at romance. It’s beautiful, restrained, subtle at its high points and touches you with the delicate comfort of a bird feather. Highly recommended viewing.","I’m a fan of subtlety. I like gestures which say a lot without a word being exchanged. Where you-say-it-best-when-you-say-nothing-at-all. I love the sound that silence brings with it. Which is why, I think I liked Majid Majidi’s Baran. The film is a romance that is an accomplishment in exercising restraint, where the bond between the two young characters in question, is never explicitly declared. You never know if its love, or infatuation, or just sympathy, a longing, or curiosity to engage with each other in a country where men and women can never be ‘friends’. Where, if the two characters had Facebook accounts, their relationship statuses would read: “It’s complicated beyond the understanding of Zuckerberg’s algorithm.”And the complications are simple to understand. At a construction site in Tehran, 17-year, chiselled face Lateef is as hot-tempered as the tea he prepares for the workers. He picks up a fight at the drop of a hat, but his life takes a turn in unimaginable ways when his Afghan co-worker gets injured and sends his young son Rahmat, as a replacement.This is Majidi gold, to be honest, part of an envious roster he churned out in his career - Children of Heaven, Pedar, Colours of Paradise, The Song of Sparrows. Unlike these films, Baran doesn’t exactly tug at your heartstrings or make you cry. Instead, it leaves you pondering about the lengths to which man’s behaviour is influenced in the presence of a woman. Especially a woman he feels an attraction for.Young actor Hussain Abedini plays that young man to perfection and the camera captures his transformation from ‘angry youngster to samaritan’ beautifully. Majidi’s focus on the goodness of human beings continues in this film as well. The villians (as expected, considering the sanctions on Majidi’s work in Iran) are the government officials, who are clamping down on the employment of Afghani refugees in Iran. Mohd. Aamir Naji, a Majidi regular, is able to bring to life the desperation of the construction site boss, Memar. He is a do-gooder, employing the needy Afghans, bailing out Lateef in times of crisis and when he loses his temper, his agony is understandable.The characters are fleshed out well, as is the mystery around Rahmat (Zahra Bahrami, in her only film appearance). With puffy, emotive eyes, Rahmat is the big surprise that the film offers and Majidi’s unveiling of that surprise is one of the most beautifully filmed scenes in the film.Beauty, in fact, is something Majidi is consistent with. For example, his fascination with pigeons to illustrate a frame. He also continues his obsession with water, as you will discover by the end of this film. In a way, water has been therapeutic to his work. What cannot be judged by man, is judged by the calm or fluidity of water.Despite being a slow film - the last 30 minutes are a bit of a struggle - it does well to capture every man’s reality: it takes a woman to make us good human beings. A mother from birth, and a wife in adulthood. Lateef doesn’t have any of them - which possibly explains his meandering ways - but when faced with a woman in his life, he does come around to changing himself.The closing shot of this film figures in my top 10 closing shots in films. Incidentally, Majidi’s other films also figure in that list. He’s clearly a master finisher. He keeps things abstract, in a way that you go home feeling comfortable with his verdict.Baran is a romance like none other. The lovers never even come close to touching each other, or brushing fingers, for that matter. But in such restraint, lies the magic of it all. They don’t call it ‘Majidi magic’ for no reason.

That I watch a lot of films with ridiculous endings for sure! Right from a few minutes after the interval, I sincerely hoped for it to not happen the way I expected it to unfold. Oh well, some things are just not meant to be. Also, it is not like the parts before the climax are spectacular. Small town Bareilly is like any other Indian small towns (or cities) - narrow lanes, broken signboards, news of closing down businesses. The inhabitants pretend to understand the English language and take pride in it, small-time entrepreneurs are content with keeping their family happy. Amidst this town that has its share of sexism, is a family that is what we would call liberal. For starters, the rare, middle-aged couple has only one daughter – a family composition unheard of in rural India. Taking that further, the father (Pankaj Tripathi) bums a cigarette from his daughter; is sensitive to his wive's thyroid malfunction-induced mood swings ; isn't too concerned that his daughter is being rejected by prospects in the arranged marriage system; and so on. Oh yeah, he also talks to the ceiling fan when he is in bed but not sleepy. Unrelated but quirky. The mother (Seema Pahwa) protests against all of this and more, but they are only mock protests. You can sense she wants this freedom for her daughter.The daughter, in her turn, takes what can be called undue advantage. She is spirited but not in a loud, “exuberance has to reek out of every word that I utter” kind of a way. This is a welcome departure from our romcoms' lead lady these days, who have to be brash and “out there” to show they are liberal and modern. To help matters along, Kriti Sanon doesn't once go overboard. If you are inclined to invest yourself so, the lackluster climax warrants a mental playback of some scenes and you admire her performance a tad more. Same goes for the usually dependable Rajkummar Rao. In comparison though, his Jekyll-and-Hyde becomes slightly tiresome and Ayushmann Khurana, for the first time in his career, seemed dull. In terms of story, the movie is exactly about what you see in the trailer. A girl falls in love with the author of a book. But, the author is sort-of anonymous, but he starts liking the girl. And so on and so forth. As anticipated there aren't any great lines. The attempt is to keep it real, which becomes a little dry. Javed Akhtar as narrator always keeps you hopeful for some great lines but they don't come by.Bareilly Ki Barfi turns out to be as underwhelming as the trailer. Neither does it have the sparks of a romance, nor the laughs of a comedy. What it does have is some fine performances, lovely details and nuances that are not usually found in Hindi films. But, these actors have given finer performances. So, put together that makes Barielly Ki Barfi a “maybe watch if it happens to be playing” kind of a film.

Subtle, delightful, sensitive and thoughtful with some wonderful performances. Brings with itself a dream-like world that any lyrical film would. ","Usually, 'sweet' films get overbearing and sticky because of the unreal overdose. But Barfi! carries the charm with such elegance and confidence that you can't but want to go along with it. It's not because the lead characters have handicaps that demand sympathy. The film takes you beyond the most obvious and endears you with the inherent charm and innocence these handicaps bring along with them. So much so that it makes you wish the plot didn't manipulate and that it got rid of characters who take advantage of their disabilities, however noble their intentions. You wish they didn't take you into the real world that deviates from the sweetness. More so, because they look like aberrations from the unreal and fantasy world of Barfi (Ranbir Kapoor) and then Jhilmil (Priyanka Chopra).Barfi! is as dreamy as a film can get. Ranbir and Priyanka play their characters so convincingly that you forget that the film is far from reality. Ileana D'Cruz looks lovely and bring her own share of grace. Just knowing our top-ranking 'stars' take on such challenging and risky roles is joy enough. But watching them give performances that make you forget their star status is way beyond expectations. You realize you were watching Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra when you step out of Barfi and Jhilmil's fairy tale story. There are times when the romance doesn't seem romantic enough. But when characters cannot express their feelings in words, when there are things that cannot be said, it opens up a whole new world of beautiful questions. Question marks that Barfi represents in just one scene where he breaks down. It is after you step out of the theater and your analytical brain takes over that you begin to wonder if Jhilmil was over-simplified. If it is indeed so easy to fall in love with an autistic woman? If it was necessary to bring in elements from the 'thriller' genre to this film that is mostly beautiful? Should I let these thoughts take away from the warmth the film created while I was watching it? At its core, it is ultimately your standard love triangle. Yes, there are a few films that Barfi! reminds you of – Hindi, English and silent. But, like with anything as standard as that, it's how the audience flows with the narrative that makes or breaks the film. And Barfi! doesn't let go of one chance to make you smile. Even if it is rather dark masked behind Ranbir's omnipresent charm. Neither does Barfi! let go of being melodious. The songs stay soulful and playful together. This once, I didn't mind the background score coming into the foreground and wanting to stay there most of the time. It made Barfi! the lyrical and soothing film that it is.Other than the light-hearted cloak Anurag Basu's writing garbs the sadness of the characters with, it creates an intriguing atmosphere with it's non-linear narration. The back and forth between the two years in the 70s make the film a lot more engaging, 'thriller' element notwithstanding. As the film closes and you see an increase in the back and forth between the 70s and present time, you wonder if the non-linearity is used to keep you with the tenderness that the film has created and not leave the theater feeling too bad for the characters. These characters don't want sympathy, they want to engage you in their bizarre story. The dark comedy of errors, the slapstick, the romance itself is captured in a series of captivating moments that keep you smiling throughout the two and half hours. Ever-so-slightly Anurag Basu also comments on the sorry  manner in which the mentally disabled are treated with in society. Who would have known there would be a romantic comedy that I enjoyed, where the romance is sweet, the comedy mostly slapsticky with background music running throughout the film. To top it of, it also had non-linear narration that it could have done without. All elements that put me off a film. Boy, do I like it when a film turns my generalized dislikes into things that I like about the film.

49,147,147,147,147,Barney's Version,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review4 Reader Reviews 2/5.0,/movie/barneys-version-review/,,2/5.0,,3.766666667,"Barney’s Version is feel-good, funny, tragic, mushy and sometimes dramatic. That’s how life is, and Barney’s life is nothing different. You know all that talk about good, meaningful cinema one can identify with? Well, this is it. Director Richard Lewis seems in complete charge of handling a variety of genres and Golden Globe winner Paul Giamatti’s performance in the title role is good enough reason for you to watch it before it runs out of cinemas.","Paul Giamatti’s face and features usually land him only comic roles. This is his coming of age film, where he transitions from comic actor to someone who can deliver so much more, with extreme maturity. Although the title may not suggest it to be, Barney’s Version is romantic in parts, a memoir in some and a witty comedy while it lasts. It’s a breezy, nostalgic ride through the life of the Jew, Barney Pagnofsky, a television producer of amateur dramas, who reflects on his life’s highs and lows, love gained and lost, at a time, when he is grappling with Alzheimer’s.The film begins with shades of a comedy and you can’t help avoid that thought, looking at Giamatti’s face.  But soon you realise that director Richard J Lewis does not draw caricatures with his characters. That’s the biggest strength of this film - just when you think the situation is hinting itself to going down the comic highway, the screenplay pulls the brakes right there. Dustin Hoffman, who plays Barney’s father, a retired detective adds much of the colour to the proceedings (the ‘meet-your-parents’ dinner, Barney’s wedding and the cemetery scenes are memorable), but he never forces his wit into conversations. Instead he and Barney are seen confronting life’s challenges with a pinch of salt. That’s the kind of father, one would love to have.What begins to look like a memoir, ultimately lands up in the alleys of mush, head-over-heels romance, marriage and raising up kids. It’s not exactly what I expected out of the film, but not something I’d mind. By keeping the focus of the film on the most important part of his life, marriage - the screenplay does find a focus. Barney’s story of falling in love again is one of the cutest chapters in this film. Miriam (Rosamund Pike) is perfect as Barney’s companion and her character, as that of an understanding wife (but only up to a point) is essayed very well in the screenplay.This is clearly Giamatti’s best performance. He has undergone some very meticulous make-up (especially his beard) to portray different periods of his life and at each stage, he seems wonderful in character. I felt my mouth open in shock, in a crucial outburst scene. What makes him stand-out and easy to identify with, is because in totality, Barney is just like one of us - sometimes he goes the extra length to achieve things, sometimes he is insecure, he drinks a bit too much alright, but he is truthful. He does make mistakes and he regrets them later. Sometimes he is lucky and sometime he gets nailed.Not only does the direction help bring out those shades beautifully, some wonderful editing (Susan Shipton) helps. The fade-ins and dissolves seem so neat and trimmed, they are perfect finishes to every small chapter in the film.It’s a pity that this film will sink without a trace thanks to poor publicity. It’s got acclaim at film festivals and award shows, but Golden Globe winner Paul Giamatti is not exactly a household name amongst Indian audiences.Expect day shows to be cancelled in most multiplexes, because very few people will turn up. In order for that not to happen, I recommend to go and watch this one! You’ll enjoy Barney’s life story.

The movie starts out with almost all characters being nice normal people, and then most of them become obsessed lovers. At one point you start feeling bad for almost all characters but then end up sympathizing with none. Someone ought to teach Urmila Matondkar the art of moving facial muscles. (Maybe, just maybe, we could see some of the facial muscles if her make-up person didn’t do his/her job so over-zealously.) Come on lady, no one groans and moans all the time, your glycerin-moistened-eyes don’t convince us that you are sad and just because you widen your eyes to double their size we can’t be made to believe that you are scared/surprised. Just imagine, your acting is pretentious! I wasn’t sure whether Urmila was enjoying being touched by Sanjay Suri or dreading it. Granted, the story line asked for both, but the sad part it is you can’t make out which one is when.  
It is sad that Juhi Chawla, Sanjay Suri, and Jimmy Sheirgill put together couldn’t make up for the lot of bad performances surrounding them, they are looking fabulous though. Sanjay and Jimmy have tried to make the most of badly drawn out characters, what were they pumping so much iron for? Some really good talent has wasted its time on a script that goes hay-wire. Other characters that are better sketched out are murdered by awesome bad acting.  
A few things have been handled better compared to the rest of the movie. The scenes showing Sanjay Suri’s imagination running wild were played out well. But how can a script as grim as this have either a dying person or someone who cares for the dying character cracking jokes a few moments before the death. The light moments make you laugh because they are sad not funny. The mundane dialogues and songs don’t help either. Now I am confused – bad dialogues or poor dialogue delivery, lousy direction or mediocre story-line…hmmmm…

How do we make an Ethical Choice which moves beyond the simply utilitarian?
What do we do as citizens when our city is under Siege by forces that we cannot understand?
How do we live in a world where the elected guardians of morality and justice are corrupt and venal?
What does it take to be a Hero?Christopher Nolan poses these questions and more in his The Dark Knight, a film which is skillfully crafted and moves beyond “the blow them up, throw them up” genre of the Super Hero Blockbuster.  Nolan’s films seem to be primarily about troubled men; his stunning “Memento”, “Insomnia”, and later “The Prestige” were all about his lead characters grappling with their frustrations, desires, and their troubled pasts, as they struggle to lead a life.  
In this film too, the two lead characters, the Joker and the Batman have to deal with a violent past - a past that is dominated by the Father.  For the Joker it is the vengeful, sadistic Father, while for the Batman, it is about the loss of the protective Father shot dead in a random street robbery.  Both are troubled men; both are fractured, and they choose different ways to deal with their respective legacies.  The Joker’s character is the Shadow Archetype; the repressed weaknesses, shortcomings, negatives, and the irrationality that we see in ourselves but do not accept, but instead project onto the other, the Villain.  The Batman is that part of us that struggles to do good, but is beset with internal demons and instinctual desires.  The Batman chooses violence to tackle crime, but that brings him face to face with his own Shadow, the Joker.  He has to struggle not to cross the limit, armed with his gadgets and martial arts skills; the Batman has to choose not to kill.  Compared to Jack Nicholson’s Joker in Tim Burton’ film, Heath Ledger’s Joker oozes menace and mayhem.  Jack Nicholson was campy, goofy, and over the top, here Heath Ledger is violent and dead serious, if not downright psychotic. 
(The use of the knife as the favourite weapon of the Joker is a masterstroke).Christopher Nolan sets up the drama with finesse; both the Joker and the Batman become more and more desperate as they engage in their protracted struggle.  No one wins, in fact the struggle takes a heavy toll, people die, loved ones are lost for ever, and there seems no way out of the quagmire.  Into this impasse, Nolan introduces the character of Two Face aka Harvey Dent the District Attorney, the once White Knight of Gotham, who now has surrendered to the Shadow.  Nolan’s hand is muted and restrained: right from the back ground music to the dialogues, he handles things in an understated and subtle manner.  The supporting cast is superb; Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, the inimitable Michael Caine as Alfred, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, and Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon.  For Nolan, Gotham city is not a city of dread and mist and dark, a city that exists in never never land, but is instead recognizably real, filled with real people with real desires, anxieties, frustrations, and most importantly beliefs.  This is not your usual blockbuster film where you ooh and aah at the loud sounds and action on screen in between mouthfuls of flavored popcorn and fiddling with your mobile phones.  With this film Christopher Nolan does for the Blockbuster / Super Hero genre, what Alan Moore’s Watchmen and Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns did for the comic book: turn what essentially seems to be an escapist fantasy into a brooding and dark allegory for our world and our times.  Watch this film as soon as you can and wonder at what a director with a keen sensibility can do with a good script and a vision without compromising on a cracker jack of a story.

The game is a lot more stimulating though, where you get to scheme and decide who to place at war.  The movie on the other hand, is a conglomeration of slow-motion alien-beating that isn’t even fancy; neither does it provide you with a sense of achievement. You’d be better off watching Director Peter Berg’s earlier venture Hancock. ","I walked out of Battleship this weekend wondering if we could ever create innovative alien-invasion movies. They’re so predictable I wish I were getting paid for my thoughts on what came next. In Battleship, the American Navy with all its machismo is our savior – protecting the world from the wrath of the extra-terrestrials. It’s ironical however, that they choose Rihanna to be on the posters of the film, while you have Liam Neeson (most noted for Schindler’s List) and Taylor Kitsch (X-Men and John Carter) playing more relevant characters. The film begins with American scientists sending radio signals into space (thankfully it’s a tad more skillfully done than Koi Mil Gaya) in the hope of finding life in other planets. We all know that’s a wrong move – the chance of a blue cute thing with magic powers to appear is quite slim for a big-budgeted Hollywood film. In 3D. Long story short: Giant aliens arrive through the sea with massive transforming spaceships with the intention to invade Earth. It is then the responsibility of a small Navy team off the coast of Hawaii to save the world. The team is headed by Officer Alex Hooper (Taylor Kitsch). Rihanna plays the arms officer on Hooper’s warship. She’s every man’s fantasy in that sense, (a portrayal which is definitely a problem) as she handles guns and screams out in authority every now and then. The problem is, we are given no back story to her involvement in the American Navy, or even reasoning to her brutal character. Actually, none of the characters have any inter-personal relationships as such. We keep cutting between their apocalyptic discussions and VFX-heavy action sequences.Such films usually rely on their grand looking action. Battleship however, is just a lot boom-boom-boom. Too much noise, and mindless non-dramatic action. There’s no tension built up between the evil alien invaders and the courageous human fighters. Not even with background music, which seems such a staple in action-heavy films. Rihanna’s a plus in the film though, with her army clothes, handling the guns rather well. You’ve got to give her some credit for making her debut is such a mindless film, and makling it seem like she really bagged a role of a lifetime. The last 30 minutes of Battleship is really what you expect from the film: unadulterated action with no build-up or logic to it. Loud background score, which induces no feelings in you, just makes you wonder if you’ll ever be able to hear properly again, and no sense of achievement whatsoever. Hearing a death-metal band vocalist scream would be a better exercise for your ears. My suggestion is, watch the film if you are nuts about Rihanna, or if you really don’t want to use your brains at all. But don’t curse me if you still come out having a sense of wasted time.

And a tribute to the 70s-80s suffers from all the loopholes that a film from then had.","First things first (oh how I hate the phrase but, how important it is), T  bhabhi, please don't read this, go and enjoy your film. That goes for all Big B lovers. I am one too, so I know how much we want to like Bbuddah Hoga tera baap.Reviewers like us will come and go, who want this, that and more in our films. But a persona like Amitabh Bachchan...Bbuddah Hoga tera baap is an attempt to pay a tribute to him. Because there can be no justifiable words after those three dots, the film is underwhelming. For example, the songs had caught on, and you knew AB Sr. is going to groove to them. I don't know what you are expecting, but something that will surpass his cool act in Jumma Chumma, maybe? That's not to say he doesn't look suave in white and orange, with a printed scarf. Or that his moves aren't as charming as they were, back then. But then, you see both, the writer/director's passion and devotion to the man whose films we grew up with. You see he's hurt, that his idol has been sidelined to roles that say, ""ol' man, you have passed your prime."" Even if they are age-appropriate. He wants to revive that charisma, maybe, one last time. That I respect.It's not like the film just showcases Amitabh Bachchan as  Amitabh Bachchan and has nothing more. Considering that the film is a blatant ""star-centric"" film, Bbuddah Hoga tera baap has a reasonably fleshed out story. The characters might not be very deeply thought out, but their motivations are clear. There are nuances that keep the film contemporary. Like the honesty about morals that were always deteriorated. He's not moralistic just because he's Amitabh BachchanBut alongside are the references/tributes to films from the 70s. The parents who hate love stories; the hero who continues to be a hero despite taking on 3-4 bullets on the chest; the gratuitous song; a girl who plays hard to get. Some of these things work, some don't. Raveena Tandon as comic relief is annoying beyond measure, for example. Then again, there are those simple things that give joy just because they aren't there. Unlike some producers we know, you don't have this one making his presence felt in a now-mandatory end credit ""item"" song. When the songs actually had enough potential to do the job. It's a film by him, for him and of him, after all.I liked Bbuddah Hoga tera baap because of Amitabh Bachcan. In a very vague way, I get Salmania. But I still use vague because, had it been an Ajooba or a Toofan, I'd have hated it. Thank you, Mr. Writer, for leaving in a story in there. But, I know you know, nothing can do justice to what Amitabh Bachchan symbolizes for at least three generations. Maybe it's time to tap how much more he's capable of. For your attempt, though, I applaud you, because I identify with your enthusiastic affection. So, here goes my attempt at a tribute. I could sit in one place and look at him, staring at a distance, humming 'Haal-e-dil' for an hour and a half and more. When he romanticizes Bombay, he combines two of my loves, and the delight it brings, makes me nostalgic about my affair with the city. When he flirts with girls less than half his age, he makes me cringe. Maybe because I see a baap in him. But soon enough, I forget that I'm seeing him, I see good ol' Viju charming his way - girls, women, police, villains, and all. Except, he can't reach out to the woman of his life. In that fleeting moment, his pain is evident, so are his arrogance, helplessness and resignation. When he kicks a villain's butt and 65+ year-old muscles move to some really complicated action choreography - without the help of a camera trick or an editor - I......oops, sorry, didn't mean to call him bbuddah! Can I get away with, ""Sir, I wanted to see more, much much more""

Yep, it is that kind of a film. ","We usually talk about Hindi films in terms of first half and second half. Befikre had me think of it in one-eighths, where the seven-eighth part of the film looked like it could be a film different from what I was expecting it to be. For that bit, with the characters, the film felt as though it was taking a mature look at relationships - especially the romantic kind. But nada. Instead we nosedive with the film to a thud. Befikre, has the now-getting-old theme of lust vs. love vs. friendship. In such films, one overpowers the other two at any given point. But, we more or less, know the direction. It is the situations and the dialogue that have a chance to make the film engaging. The “dare” game in Befikre, which seems to be the source of all bonding between Shyra (Vaani Kapoor) and Dharam (Ranveer Singh) doesn't cut it. The couple then follows the usual pattern in their falling apart. There is one difference though. Usually, it is the female lead who is intolerably shrill in such fights, here Ranveer Singh matches Vaani Kapoor note for note. This makes the first five minutes of the film intolerable outright. Other than that though the duo don't annoy again and get back into tolerable zone. They are playing smart, urban characters who are bold about their desires and clear about their needs. It wouldn't be a surprise if the actors are playing their real-life personalities, right? That's why it doesn't sound or look too impressive. These characters aren't all black and white. They do seem confused about things that some of us might take for granted like commitment and not hurting other people. They flip-flop between their wants and don't wants. They have way too many change of hearts for us to keep track. We are used to seeing all of this in our films, and some of them we like more than others. Befikre just doesn't entertain or engage and gets outlandish by the end of it all. There are lots of Aditya Chopra parallels to be drawn – from the change in role of parents to the shift in focus of romance to the changing nature of love over these last three decades. But, it feels as if, in his effort to be “free from his own cinematic traps”, he hasn't been able to wriggle out too far. The changes seems a little too perfunctory rather than germane to the story. The only thing that felt relatively relevant in the story is that the protagonists have “new-age”, cool-ish jobs that kind-a sort-a get in the way of their relationship. I guess that the woman has a job is new-age enough for us. Never mind. That the storyteller in him had to adopt a non-linear style of narration gives away the fact that he wasn't too sure about holding the viewers' attention with the story as is. And of course, it seems like no one can help self-referencing these days. That aside, none of the supposedly “aawwww” moments reach out. None of the supposedly “crazy” moments feel crazy enough or real. There are only so many times that we can believe a person getting away with offending the authorities in France (or anywhere for that matter). There are only so many times we can see the whole world revolve around the lead pair - which is no more restricted to background dancers in songs. The biggest put-off is that grown-ups behave like juveniles when in love. They behave as if they've never heard of age-old problems like toilet seats and wet towels. Makes you wonder if the writers have experienced real life, real relationships – those outside the movie world.

None of it germane to a story. ","Are women treated any differently now than they were back in 1947? Are women “sex providers”  whether or not they are sex-workers? Is national pride or religion more important than humanity? Was the land of the people not raped when the border was laid out in 1947? These are the questions Begum Jaan, the film asks without saying it out loud. While that is worth appreciating, the metaphors are so direct that they just about qualify as metaphors. Begum Jaan then is full of ideas that get badly beaten up in execution.Begum Jaan is loud – both the film and the character. It is ok for one character in a film to be loud, but when a whole cackle of characters is loud it is difficult to take it seriously. It reminds you of loud Hindi TV series or typical Hindi slapstick films – an association that is unlikely to bode well for any film. To top that off, almost each woman in Begum Jaan's brothel is pretty much the same. There are barely any distinguishing characteristics - except for their accent. There is a touch of a difference in terms of one has a lover, one has a child and so on. But these are superficial differences. Something the writers seem to have added to convince themselves that these women are different from each other.Same thing can be said about the actors. They are all models who have been asked to accessorise their costumes a little differently from each other but else the body language, the mannerisms, the thought process, are all more or less, identical. Vidya Balan of course stands out. The powerful actress that she is, she blends in too. After the initial exposition, she becomes more and more Begum Jaan and less Vidya Balan. Other than her though, it is only Chunkey Pandey who moves you – his first scene in the film is enough to send a chill down the spine. That the film doesn't capitalise on his acting any further is only a shame. That there is no depth in the writing keeps coming back to you in different shapes and forms - be it in the situation, the involvement with characters or even the dialogue. It doesn't help that until the interval, everything you see you know from the trailer. And yet, there are a couple of things that you would expect to happen and they don't. That in its own way is refreshing. However, some of the unpredictable things are also made so for effect and seem out of place. Moreover, the drama - extended length of scene, over-written dialogue, loud background score,  husky voices (because you know, they are sex-workers) - makes some parts of the film almost unbearable. That is pretty much symbolic of almost everything about the film. Whether it is one of the two impactful moments in the film or the overall concept itself – it all seems just skin deep.

The title itself is one big eyeroll. So that's that.,"The very premise induces cringes in plenty – why are young men asked to treat all the young women around them as sisters? Sure, the issue of honor killing is touched upon, but it seems more as an after thought, when the writers realised that the premise is not virtuous enough to hold ground for an otherwise done-to-death “family vs. lovers” theme.There is a certain freshness in how the logistics of certain situations are explained. For example, the lies that need to be told to get one's way. In fact, these logistics implicitly point to how well characters know each other. For example, the stories a character makes up to get the parents to behave in a certain way. Both these aspects are rare in films and even more so because it is executed using the “show, don't tell” rule. There is some snappy dialogue to support this through too.But this goodness lasts only a few scenes and is washed away with other sequences. In contrast, some scenes are just too superficial to make any sense. And a few others are replete with exaggeration. None of the characters require any real out-of-the-world acting. The performers just need to not go overboard and that they manage – more or less. Given the one line plot of a love story that is as standard as it gets, it boiled down to the angle this particular premise takes on the plot. That no man really wants to treat women around him as sisters sounds more like a frustrated rant of a many-year-old, suppressed angst. Now, would that motivate you to watch the film?

Besharam is that film for Ranbir Kapoor.The worst bit is that it doesn't do this typical stuff with conviction. Everything from the villain's tyranny to the hero's unabashed personality via the lead lady's pretentiousness seems very well calculated and squeezed in to fit a formula.What's more, this must be first of Ranbir Kapoor's films where you just cannot forget that it is him on screen. It doesn't help that his parents feature in the film as a couple; even though the three of them together Ranbir Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh do their best to infuse energy into a spark-less script. It is their comic timing that brings the few laughs that the dialogue allow. That besides, they have pretty much made fools of themselves in a couple of scenes. Pallavi Sharda's presence doesn't bring in any sparkle either. Javed Jaffrey only adds his well-known poor puns. Then again, maybe the blame should be reserved for the writing department. I sat there feeling pretty much insulted that the makers thought this would go down as story/characters/dialogue for us, as an audience. It's not only the predictability of how the different worlds of Mr. Besharam's personality come together or the lack of a peak point. It is as much the feeling that minimum effort was put into thinking about these attributes. Even the action sequences and songs are rather generic.Sure, there is an attempt at being fresh by including bold and crass dialogue. You also have your typical film references strewn across - from Sholay to DDLJ to of course, Dabangg. But, can these lines work when the overall plot is as run-down as it was a couple of decades ago? A soft-cornered Robin Hood-like  hero; a woman who so easily falls for the guy after putting up oh-so-much resistance; a comic relief track. In fact, the mix is worsened by an uninterested villain. Maybe people who can watch Ranbir Kapoor do anything will have a good laugh with him in this one. But, are a star's fans doing justice to his talent by liking films that they wouldn't want the star associated with, in general?

58,156,156,156,156,[The] Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/best-exotic-marigold-hotel-review/,,,,1.666666667,"On their first visit to India, Judy Dench’s character, who also plays the narrator of the film, describes her feeling with an extremely apt line: “An assault of the senses”. Director John Madden shows us a clichéd, but comfortable India filled with colors, sounds and a large handful of people, but also manages to strike a chord with the stories of the seven characters. Watch The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for its performances and a well-written unfolding of intertwining stories. ","Youth is celebrated in the Hindi film industry – where else would you find 40-year-old actors, play college-going students? It’s an industry where a female actor is gracefully expected to retire from being a heroine at the age of 35, tops. In contrast to this, what strikes most about The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is that the movie involves the unfolding on the lives of seven elderly British people and their journey to India. For its abashed take on human experience, regardless of age, The Best Exotic Marigold is a delightful watch.The film begins with an introduction of characters, and spends not more than a fast-paced minute or two to wittily describe their current lives. It’s a concoction of a cast that you assume (correctly so), cannot go wrong. The ensemble includes Judy Dench as a newly widowed housewife, Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilkin, a married couple of 40 years, Maggie Smith as an uptight ex-housekeeper, Tom Wilkinson as an ex-court Judge, Ronald Pickup (true to his name) as wannabe Casanova longing for companionship and Celia Imrie as a hopeful husband hunter. They all find themselves on a flight to Jaipur to a hotel/retreat for the “Elderly and the Beautiful” – where they meet an effervescent Sonny (Dev Patel), the manager of the hotel who tries to sell the dusty, out of order place as an upcoming palace. Evidently, their hopes and dreams of an exciting old-age experience is on the brink of shattering. We see the film take a route of discovery; an interesting mix of self-discovery and a sense of wonder and amazement towards this culture shock. Director, John Madden is able to place the personal stories and the wide array of public experiences with a captivating sense of visual beauty. Within the first half of the film, you get absorbed into the lives of these characters; even Patel’s life as the manager of the hotel; he has his own baggage. You find yourself hoping the Hotel will have a makeover soon, and that it looks as beautiful as Patel’s Shakespearean mumbling to potential financers. Soon, you find yourself falling in love with the surroundings, even though the choice to portray an ever-Indian aspect in the film is largely clichéd (with stress on the heat, stench, over-population, and our obsessive curiosity towards foreigners), you find that an effort has been made. The background score through the film is overwhelming, with its soothing classical Hindustani tones. Most of all, it’s a relief to see the Indians in the film talk in Hindi and not with an accented English. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is not a fast-paced film with too much to absorb – it allows you to slowly take in every experience that the characters are experiencing, and every visual that over-powers them. The Indian clichés are calming, and remind you of surrounding that you are used to. Sometimes, the film does ponder over a situation for far too long, trying to bring out the abstract beauty of the scene, but for the most part, the performances, profound dialogue and comical/wondrous perspective of India make the film a worth-while watch.

Despite desperate attempts to be different, Bewakoofiyaan is only as interesting as the ups and downs of any relationship in trouble. ","Almost everyone who is reading this review is in or has had a romantic relationship like you see in Bewakoofiyaan. And it would be a rare couple, if at all, who hasn't had a fight. Would our story make for a good film though? Most likely, not. Not because we make for boring people but because it's everyday life. So, does everyday life not make for good films? It does, but it needs very special skills and an out-of-the-box way to go about the story to make for an engaging story. Bewakoofiyaan is not that story.Bewakoofiyaan has an energetic, aspirational, young couple in Mohit (Ayushman Khurana) and Mayera (Sonam Kapoor). You relate to them because they are more or less like you. You start rooting for them from the very beginning. Ayushman Khurana's comic timing and chemistry with father-in-law-to-be (Rishi Kapoor) keeps matters light and engaging for a bit. But, soon enough things start getting repetitive and before you know it, you have started predicting the next sequence pretty accurately. Ayushman Khurana does go through the whole ""down"" time pretty convincingly. Sonam Kapoor too goes does the middle class lady who takes her success in stride while being a supporting girlfriend and a caring daughter with ease. But decent performances by the three main characters cannot life the film from the general bore that it is. Sure, Bewakoofiyaan does try to be different in how the adamant father's reluctance to warm up to the daughter's boyfriend. The lead pair's characters are also pretty close to earth in an urban way.Mohit  adequately goes through the phases of over-confidence, confidence, insecure and then bruised ego as any young man who has lost his job would. Mayera is always there for Mohit, aspirational yet in control of those aspirations. It can be argued that she sacrifices her career goals and isn't the woman of today's day and age she is made out to be. But, I'd give the writers that. I'd say Mayera knows what are priorities are and doesn't care how we judge her for them. It is a shame then, that despite characters written with more thought than you would see in your average Hindi rom-com, Bewakoofiyan ultimately falls below par. A huge part of the blame can be taken by the film's pace. The love between the couple, the father's sweet reluctance takes its time to build up. The fallout between the couple while the father-son-in-law relationship takes its own turn is cumbersome yet not intolerable. The problem is with the climax which is both rushed and over-simplistic in its writing and execution. Especially, when compared to the rest of the film. The same old clichés kick in with double force which makes you feel, you sat through all of that for this? With very little going for it in the music and other technical departments then, Bewakoofiyaan feels like listening to a friend's woes about their relationship - with empathy and love; but you want them to kiss and patch up, already. So, that you can move on too.

If only the Iranian director had avoided drama especially through some of the performances and the background score. These took a toll on the subtlety that could have been.,"There’s something about films that glorify kindness that makes you want to hug them. There’s something about films that poke at how unfair life is that make you want to cry. Beyond The Clouds does that but only in passing moments. If only, those feelings lingered longer. And an even bigger if only, if only the filmmaker didn’t take the Hindi-movie-style drama route. The film touches upon selfish and selfless kindness from various aspects. It also expresses selfless large-heartedness that takes on shades of self-interest as the relationship progresses. Some of these moments are so pure and believable that it is heart-warming. And it makes you smirk at your surprise when you see the generosity. Beyond the Clouds goes to the other extreme too. It shows you lives that you wouldn’t wish upon your enemies. It shows you lives that you know exist but you’d rather not know about. With the final scene, it even offers perspective that convinces you to look at your life with gratitude. Yet, moments like the final scene and what they imply are few and far between. The movie starts of with this lovely single, long shot that moves with the characters and juxtaposes Mumbai’s tall buildings with her slums.  It set a tone that I wish it kept. While Beyond The Clouds doesn’t pull all stops and go completely over-the-top on us like many a Hindi film, it also doesn’t refrain from using drama to underline a point or spell out a mood. This is where it lost me as an audience because I was often jolted out from the very world the film had created for me. At times it was the performance to blame. For instance, every time Malavika Mohanan came on screen she broke all existing mood to create a forced mood. Her plastered ‘brown’ make-up didn’t help either. The background score often co-existed to accentuate the distance between the characters and the audience. And at  other times, it took on the lead role in doing so. Ishaan Khatter, on the other hand is earnest and holds the film and your attention. Unfortunately, the effort shows. G V Sharda and the girls who play her granddaughters are, on the other hand, more natural. Their performances evoked emotion enough for you to care for them. If you walk in to the film expecting an Indianised version of a Majid Majidi film, you will find it a little too Indian and too little of a Majidi film. However, if you go in expecting a different take on Mumbai and its inhabitants, a different aspect of humanity that you find in the nooks and corners of any metropolitan, you might just come out enjoying it.

But, would the risk of Milkha Singh's spirit reaching out to a smaller audience been worth it? So, this once, if having Milkha Singh dance while tapping his buttocks is what it takes, so be it. I am sure writer, Prasoon Joshi must have thought long and hard over what was left out of Milkha Singh's story and what was added. It is a shame that typical Farhan Akhtar-style PJs (Poor Joke) found their way in. From having seen him as himself on TV shows, the jokes instantly reminded me it was Farhan Akhtar I am watching. It took away from the otherwise gripping performance. Yeah, his accent doesn't flow naturally, it comes across as trained. His diction is slightly distracting - as it is when he speaks Hindi or English too. But, Farhan Akhtar smiles his charming smile to endear Milkha Singh to you. The upper teeth jutting forward give it, what I assume, a Milkha touch. You sense Milkha's pain and determination. You want him to go easy on himself when he heaves and pants. And you want him to win. Divya Dutta and Pawan Malhotra add the much needed layers to Milkha Singh's personality than Milkha Singh himself. Their characters' aspirations and pride show through in the couple of emotional scenes between each one of them and Milkha Singh. Divya Dutta is easily one of the most under-rated actors in Hindi films. Jabtej Singh as young Milkha too gets you to feel his pain, despair and courage.On the other hand, Sonam Kapoor does her usual do as Neeru. She's stiff and looks like she's making a style statement with her salwar suits and hair curls. She has such little impact that you feel you have seen a lead lady in the film for the first time when Rebecca Breeds comes on screen as Stella.  Similarly, Prakash Raj as the comic relief didn't work for me either, as in he acted well, but the comedy seemed a little off for the film. If there is one thing you can tell about Indian men from what was going on, on screen and in the audience is that it takes as little as either a few bikini-clad or non-Indian women to excite them. Anyway, as discomforting as that was, from Neeru to Stella to Perizad (Meesha Shafi) they all exist to show Milkha Singh's priority - his work. The little time spent on Milkha Singh's transition from one woman to another tell's you about the makers' focus too - Milkha Singh and his training. I've always had a problem with the little time spent on the athlete's training in a sports film, or for that matter the minimal time that any underdog takes to come up to speed in a film. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is more than satisfying in that respect. Milkha Singh gets long and strenuous training sessions from the director,   enough for you to beg for his mercy on Milkha Singh's behalf. Another huge section of the film is the flashbacks into Milkha Singh's childhood and especially the partition of 1947. The sequences are a little too over-stylized for the era that they are set in. But, they are styled well. The editing, the transitions, the interspersing are all pretty slick and thus end up giving those bits a contemporary feel. Again, if that's what it takes to keep more people interested, so be it. The non-linear narration also keeps you absorbed.As you stay engaged, you realise that this is not about one athlete or one victim of the partition. Taking nothing away from how special Milkha Singh's achievements were to the country, especially in those times, almost any athlete will have stories of his roots and hardwork worth narrating. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is as much a salute to them as it is to the man himself. It is as much a tribute to the millions of partition victims who suffered and sustained as it is about how unfair his life was. You also wonder if the situation, especially of athletes, has really improved today. In fact, from the couple of cases I know, our non-star athletes have it worse now. The conditions they have to sustain in, the politics and corruption involved is mind-boggling. Subtly, the film also tells you how our soldiers, our protectors, have it worse than our athletes. It doesn't dwell too much on it, because the core of the film is Milkha Singh's spirit. I want my kids to watch Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, and I recommend you take yours too (Please read Parental Guidance section for details on Violent and Sexual content).  Not only for the film's potential to inspire, but also to sensitize them to parts of our history that are terrifying. Even more terrifying is that it is being forgotten and taken for granted. Kids know the partition, at best, as a story - India got freedom; India was divided; millions of people were displaced.  Bhaag Milkha Bhaag gives them a glimpse of what a kid their age went through. And of course, it's also important they see how he persevered through hardships that they cannot even imagine. It's our job then, to have them extrapolate it to the millions who suffered. So, this time around I'll take the little ones to the theater, not for the beauty of seeing life on screen, but for the beauty of a life or many.

Of course, everything was just too loud, as expected. Not to mention the added bonus I would have received, of not having to listen to the oh-so-pathetic dialogues.What I didn’t forget though, was that Priyadarshan mentioned in one of his interviews, “No one with brains should watch Bhagam Bhag”. Honestly, I listened to him, I had left my brains home. Believe me, I was not looking for logic in a single scene, let alone in the movie as a whole. I didn’t realize that I was not to look forward to a few good laughs from a comedy! The absurdity of it all does not make you laugh either. I refuse to accept that the audience is expected to laugh at Akshay Kumar’s face stuck between two half-naked hairy butts. The only line that made me laugh hard was the dig Bunty (Akshay Kumar) takes at Akshay Kumar the real-life actor. And I had a smile in one of the other very forgettable scenes between Akshay Kumar and Govinda. That was my laugh and a half. No amount of decent acting by Akshay Kumar, Govinda, and Paresh Rawal’s could save the movie. The train of thoughts going through my mind while watching the movie….Can’t blame the dialogue writer if he has to try and find some way of doing justice to a shoddy screenplay. Almost any of the sub-plots could be cut-and-pasted in any order and we would have a similar product….But, how can it be the screenplay’s fault if it has to contrive and adjoin five stories that have nothing to do with each other?....Nope, certainly cannot point fingers at the director if he has zilch to work with….Oops.…they are all done by the same people – dialogues, screenplay, story (ies), direction….Hey! The audience is supposed to be dumb, not the makers. With all the control, they surely are capable of coming up with something better. This is one of those rare movies where you wait for a song, however irrelevant. You just want the characters to stop talking! Indeed, the songs were a welcome relief. ‘signal’ and ‘tere bin’ have good music. Sameer has added a new set to his list of rhyming words ‘afreen – nazneen - dilnasheen’. As always, the words that come before and after the rhyming words do not matter. It is exasperating when you cannot enjoy a movie even if you give your brain a vacation. Such movies don’t make me laugh, they make me angry!

It is funny in bits, and has some good performances, but these don’t manage to save the film.","There haven’t been very many films in the recent past that traverse the graph that Girish Mohite’s Bharatiya does, with respect to the nature of its narrative. Armed with an interesting concept, the film is rocky but intriguing for much of its first hour. Thereafter, it descends into absurdity and preachiness of the kind that is bound to irritate even the most tolerant viewer at some point or the other.The film opens with a wandering soothsayer, played by Makarand Anaspure, breaking the fourth wall and talking to the audience. He introduces the story that is about to unfold, in a forgotten village called Adnide, located on the Maharashtra-Karnataka border. The village itself has a host of expectedly quirky characters. Mohan Agashe and Kuldeep Pawar, for example, play a couple of power hungry old men who are at each other’s throats, all the while vying to be the head of the village. The soothsayer goes on to suggest that something explosive is soon going to happen in this village. Enter city-bred lad Abhay Sardeshmukh (played by Subodh Bhave) who intends to return to the village where his ancestors hailed from, for reasons that unveil as the film progresses.The film’s one-word theme is quite simple - identity. What does it mean, to belong to a village, a state and a country, especially one like India, perhaps the most diverse nation in the world? Using a sleepy village that seems to run on autopilot as the subject actually doesn’t seem like too bad an approach to explore this question. However, the story meanders around such farfetched situations and characters that it becomes hard to take the film seriously after a particular point.That isn’t to say that the film doesn’t entertain. It does, even if only sporadically, mainly because of some of the dialogue and the performances. Pawar and Agashe are in fine form, injecting their deadpan comedy with near-perfect timing. Jitendra Joshi is another actor who shines. Last seen playing the title role in Tukaram, this one is a little more up his alley – a confused lover forever eyeing the daughter of his rival. Few people play dumb on screen like he does, and he does make you laugh with this character as well.One must grant that Subodh Bhave does try his best as the opinionated, petulant do-gooder that his character Abhay is. However, one can only do so much with a character that is as flat, preachy and, quite frankly, ridiculously silly as this one is. Intended to be the anchoring pillar of the film, Abhay’s character is quite easily one of the major flaws of the film. Switching genres ever so often eventually becomes a problem for the film, because the audience rarely knows what to expect. While that may be a good thing for a film that is solely a thriller, this one is not. Not knowing that you are actually watching a political satire means a lot of the situations will actually be lost on you.While director Girish Mohite has definitely moved forward since his last film, the disastrous Pratibimb, Bharatiya is still not a film that I’d recommend. In spite of the generous dose of comic moments, Bharatiya eventually becomes a tedious watch.

Or something that should be a slice of life - good humor. Vinay Pathak reminds you how to take a joke on yourself and Rajat Kapoor how not to make a joke on the likes of Vinay. And they do so in comical situations that build on top of each other supported by some simple but really amusing lines.,"The oil being the glossy glitter associated with mainstream Hindi cinema. Isn't it a shame this movie is being called one without ""stars""? As soon as Vinay Pathak makes me laugh with the way he locks his briefcase, he is my star. If I yell, ""aaa-ouch"" when Rajat Kapoor gets hit on his back that is already hurting, isn't he doing something right? Dialogues that characters are made to repeat at every opportunity possible usually make me sick. But, this time, I could have been caught laughing out loud at a couple of such dialogues. Here, they are subtle and an integral part of the personality - not forced, not squeezed in to increase the line-count of the actor. I laughed in anticipation every time. For some reason even the predictable misunderstandings made me laugh.  And just when I thought, ""okay enough now, this is not going to be funny anymore"", the character didn't say it again and the movie ended soon thereafter. The makers knew not to push it too far. That understanding, and the ability to resist the temptation to do it just one more time, is creditable. Sorry, didn't mean to take away anything from the lines that were not repeated. Most of the dialogues are witty and keep you in splits throughout! Like some of the dialogues, things that irritate in real life are used to irritate the characters and get a laugh out of the audience. E.g., the sound effect used to exaggerate the noise created while handling a plastic bag is just hilarious and needs special mention. This is how cinematic liberties should be taken. And not just because you are allowed to. There were a few things that, maybe, were 'outside the scope of the movie' from the maker's point of view but left the audience with questions. Like the inconsistency in Sarika's character. (Read more in the  ""what didn't work"" section). The other problem was that in his very short role, Ranveer Shorey overacted. Yes, you read that right. Granted he was asked to pull a face and modulate his voice in a certain manner. But it didn't work. His character looked rather out-of-place in the otherwise believable set of characters. However, here is something that worked. More than half of Milind Soman's lines were very appropriately - Laugh. And he did laugh heartily. The most wonderful part is that the movie is as much a joke on the simpleton clerk as it is on the arrogant upper class businessman. And yes, these certainly are the kinds of characters that you would be annoyed at if you were with them, but are ready to burst out laughing at because they are with someone else. They make you fondly remember the guys in college who were sources of entertainment not because of any ""talent"" but because of their personalities. I wouldn't wait for the DVD because this is the kind of comedy that needs to be encouraged - intentional.

","Anyone going in expecting a Bheja Fry - Part 2 will be disappointed. Anyone going in expecting laugh-out-loud comedy will be disappointed. The only people who have any hope of being satisfied are the Vinay Pathak believers. That too, is more of the same. But we'll make do since we've paid for the ticket. This is a serious case of give him too much money, and your disciplined child will become a spoilt brat. You have your aerial shots and cruise ships and remote island locales. It’s cool, it's great even. But just for the sake of creating a situation which sounded great in your head? Especially the regional jokes were the least funny of them all! I don't know if it's a boon that Vinay Pathak is around to save the film or a curse that he spent time on it. Kay Kay Menon would have sleep walked through Bheja Fry 2 in his amateur days (if there is anything  like that for him, that is.) Amongst the rest you have Minissha Lamba in the first half and Amole Gupte in the second. She is clueless and he is loud, deafeningly loud. Amole Gupte's character is equally out of place too. In fact, everything in the second half just goes over-the-top. It becomes like a Tom and Jerry show, waiting to become funny. Or just getting stuck in admiring the brilliant simpleton vs. snotty idea that they had in the first film, and not knowing how to milk it further. Dear Mr. Ballary, if I want to see a senseless, plotless film that wants to make me laugh and fails miserably. I have my guaranteed avenues. I don't want precious money reserved for smaller films spent on that kind of tripe. New tripe, I'm ready for.  But the same thing over, na-ah.It hurts, you know? I mean, it's fantabulous and all that jazz when independent filmmakers get more money to make their films after a good first show. It's even better to have a Vinay Pathak on screen. Heaven knows how much I love seeing him over a moustache that is the only muscle moving on an actor's face. Or a dimple. But it hurts, and you know not how, when a Ready makes me laugh a little more than a Vinay Pathak-Kay Kay Menon film.

Same old violence. Same old attempt at creating value through shock. Gore and sexual titillation are abundant. Over-dramatization and slo-mo exposition throughout drags the film. There is an attempt to tie all ends neatly, but there are only a few lines that make an impression, that too not a lasting one. ","""Life is a game of chess"" - That statement is neither new nor profound. Yet, Bhindi Bazaar Inc's makers are so impressed with the analogy that they made a movie out of it. And took every move literally. It's parallel between the chess game and the story of the film is fun to start with but it gets tiring very soon. The entire movie feels like one long exposition, where characters are still being introduced. It could be because of the over-dramatization or the slo-mo sequences, it seems like you are still seeing new stuff - new people, new situations within the film. When, in fact, you aren't. Also, the way the film unfolds, you are like, ""ok, you introduced me to the characters, let the real story begin."" This is largely because the ""real"" story is all in flashback. In fact, the present is just teasing you. Constantly.It also feels like a teaser because Kay Kay Menon is just sitting there, you can just about call his role an elongated special appearance. Similarly, there is nothing challenging about what Piyush Mishra or Prashant Narayanan have to do either. The only sore thumb sticking out is the new kid on block Gautham . He just doesn't match up to any of the talent he is surrounded by.Deepti Naval represents the condition of the suppressed woman in the underworld with calm and composure. Just like Shilpa Shukla expresses the growing role of women in crime with aggression. Vedita Singh gets to play the slutty b!tch, and she makes most of the opportunity. The conclusion being the cast was capable; they are just offered run-of-the-mill material to work with. It is possible that we have grown up since the days of Satya and Is Raat Ki Subah Nahi and we are better exposed to cinema from around the world. Maybe, if we weren't Bhindi Bazaar Inc would have worked a better.It's not as if they didn't give the plot a thorough think through and just patched stuff together as it came in. The attempts to dot the 'I's are clean and clear. But all of it is done over and over again - the overall story for sure. And the details are filled in with filthy language and crass dialogue - all of which is appropriate given the setting, all of which also doesn't shock any more.I can't help but feel a tad disappointed. It's not like I walked in with great expectations. It's just that I thought I'd be coming out with some mind-blowing performances that I'd remember for a long time to come.

The film has also been remade in Kannada and Telugu, and more famously in Tamil, with Rajnikant in the lead.  Having unleashed a spate of shallow, loud, and situational gag oriented comedies, all of which were remakes of various Malayalam films, Bhool Bhulaiya requires Priyadarshan to tackle something that he had no need to engage with so far; namely a script that revolves around the psychological perturbation of one of the characters.  This perturbation causes certain effects, all of which we see in sequence as the film unspools.  The cause is revealed towards the end, and justifies the climax of the film.  All the major characters in the film are part of the “Great Indian family”; so we have the karta and his sister, their respective spouses and children, and the nephew who has just returned from America with his new bride.  The only non ‘family’ character who is significant is the psychiatrist, played by Akshay Kumar. The director is unable to decide whether he would like the film to be a comedy or sound  a more serious note; the first half sees him trying to squeeze laughter from the audience by forcing the ‘senior family’ members to act like half wits, while the second half suddenly becomes somber and doom laden.  This necessitates a sudden change in the character of the psychiatrist, who until then is only too happy to ham it up loudly with the other members of the family.Unfortunately this sudden shift in mood leaves the viewer laughing at or at the very least contemplating this ‘serious’ part of the film, which includes the climax, with mild amusement.  The director is unable to create and sustain an ambience and a tempo that involves the viewer and has him or her empathizing with the collective ordeals of the family members, as well as that of the lead protagonist.  From a slightly more abstract perspective, the film can be seen as a clash between western rationality and religious superstitition (as embodied in myths and a belief in the occult) and represented in the film as a clash between two generations: one steeped in rituals and esoteric practices and living in a ‘Hindu small town’, and the other, embodied through modern and western educated characters who hold ‘professional’ occupations.  This theme is further exemplified in the film through the character of the psychiatrist and his ‘modern’ psychology versus the mumbo jumbo of the religious priests.  Towards the end of the film a change is shown happening to one of the characters.  This change could possibly be interpreted as an omnivorous female sexuality reasserting itself in the face of insipid patriarchal matrimony!!!!  This sexuality is subversive and threatening to the existing patriarchal order and hence the psychiatrist (male, of course) helps restore order and put things in their proper place.The cast has little to do in the film as they are playing out stereotypes; a fine actor like Shiney Ahuja is reduced to either bland acceptance or frothing rage, Amisha Patel weeps and moans throughout in a shrill voice, Vidya Balan is all sunshine and cheer, while Asrani, Paresh Rawal, and Manoj Joshi alternately rant and rave or are busy trying to look scared.  Akshay Kumar does his best, but the sudden shift in the script from the comic to the darkly tragic, pulls the stuffing out of his performance.  Vineeth  has been chosen for a non-consequential role, only for his terpsichorean prowess.  Rajpal Yadav is a total waste, not his fault, as his screen time runs to about five minutes or so. 
Sabu Cyril’s art direction is adequate, though he overdoes his bit in the crowd scenes and peoples the frame with too many holy men.  The songs are a distraction and come in the way of the script seeking to build and maintain psychological tension.  The climax is worthwhile, but unfortunately the emphasis on comedy in the earlier part of the film, completely ruins it.  The director could have reined himself in and set a bleak and ominous approach which would have made the film taut but does not do so, possibly because of the ‘comic’ expectations that the audience has of him.  One wonders whether one would ever get to see realistic cinema in mainstream Bollywood; even when the themes are realistic, the execution reduces them to crude buffoonery or a stylized gore fest.  One waits for the day.

","Bhoomi is exactly what you expect. An over-dramatic story of a father and daughter who want to avenge the rape of the daughter. Right from when the film looks at establishing the adorably, loving bond that Bhoomi (Aditi Rao Hydari) and her father (Sanjay Dutt) share, it seems over-the-top. It never lets go of that tone and thus comes across as trying too hard and failing.The dialogue is extremely heavy-handed. Every line seems like it wants to make an impact. It is saved by decent delivery though. The entire cast lends its lines some credibility. But, the intention of the lines itself is to be loud and forceful. So, there is only so much the actors can do. Almost each one of them takes on a mode and sticks through it – that's just how the characters are written. Despite some great performers, the performances cater to the demand to be overbearing – overbearingly tearful, funny, sad, angry, disgusting and so on. The situations that make for the story are episodic and the over-arching story is unengaging. All its attempt to appeal to emotion seem hollow. This is despite being a topic that concerns and affects our day-to-day lives. It doesn't help that each of the situations is dragged on for a bit too long, especially the “drunken” scenes in the first few minutes. Unfortunately, the big reveal of the film is quite predictable. Except for the effort of the actors, there isn't anything going for Bhoomi. There are a couple of well conceptualised scenes, especially the one in the climax.

Even if the aim of the film is to disgust and horrify you, the approach it takes doesn't make the film any more palatable. ","Just the experience of watching a film like Bhoot Returns in the theater is annoying, where the audience is so sure of having come for a comedy film masked as a horror film that it can never stop giggling. Save a few minutes in the the last quarter of the film there wasn't a minute of silence in the audience. Continious chitter-chatter and/or laughter was on because of what was happening on screen or rather because of what was NOT happening. The plot barely moved an inch in the first half. Night turned into day and day turned into night, with the nights getting longer but the material stayed pretty much the same. The attempt at replicating the Paranormal Activity effect again was superficial and quite plainly didn't work. While days passed, the dialogue was outright hilarious because it was so inane. While some of it might have been intentionally comic like say the hide-and-seek sequence, but it looked all too silly. For a change though background music, albeit loud, had been used a little differently and created a tiny bit of tension. The use of 3D on the other hand, was rather comical. It was employed either to give a wide-angle effect or to make items in the foreground obstruct the view to things/people in the background. While Manisha Koirala did a decent job of being scared, her character Namrata is disturbingly not your standard  loving mother. Even if a mother is self-centered, it is difficult to imagine her yelling at her child who is so obviously in need of help. The rest of the cast was just about okay but the dismal tele-marketing kind of dubbing for Madhu Shalini was extremely distracting. Not to mention, the only reason for her existence in the film seemed to be to add some X factor, for there's nothing she, as the possessed child's aunt did that either parent couldn't have done.Personal judgments and role definitions aside the much advertised horrifying climax was a bit too uncomfortable to digest. And maybe that was exactly the aim of the film – to make its audience uncomfortable at the very thought. Yet, it makes me sick to even think that there might be people out there who are okay with what the conclusion implies. My usual complaint about having child artists play roles of possessed humans stays though, I guess, I can be relatively relieved that it is kept down to just one sequence which was not that intense either. While one can thank Mr Verma for keeping the film short at 90 minutes, the re-return of the Bhoot seems imminent. And that, I am certainly wary of.

Unfortunately though, the target audience is likely to enjoy it, despite the rating I assign to it. Through the movie kids do things that you usually see adults do in movies and thus can be entertaining for the children. The special effects can be appreciated for the tribute they are trying to pay to the Harry Potter, Men in Black and Matrix movies. However, they are rather amateurish. The sound effects are done too over-enthusiastically. The comedy bits are at best slapstick. The cameraman seems to love the nauseating 45 degree angle. The only song has lousy lyrics and a distinct Baba Saigal feel to it. It has been picturised very shabbily too. And to top it all, the print quality isn’t the best in many sequences. Jackie Shroff’s Johnny Depp-look works well. He has done a good job and should have been used much more, like we were led to believe from the promos. Also, it would have been nice if his head was not chopped off by the cameraman so often. The ghost character that he plays seems to have no defined powers and can do almost anything. But hey, this is a work of pure fiction, so who are we to bind the story-writers creativity? The child artists in the movie have given a decent and balanced performance. It’s the adults who will get on your nerves with their over-acting. It is extremely annoying when the actors face the audience while delivering their dialogues when they are actually talking to another character in the movie.  I don’t know whether to be sad or happy that the kids have done a better job than the presumed grown-ups. Despite all of this, I think the children are going to like the movie, mainly because it hardly has any competition. There are hardly any non-animated Hindi movies for children. What is it with all these movies being released bang in the middle of exam-time?! Anyway, this is a feel good movie for children where all bad characters realize their mistakes and change their ways by the end. Warning!! The rating is only for the target audience! Adults, don't bother, but this one might be okay for the times you need your children to be out of your hair for a couple of hours.

Bhoothnath starts off with imaginative use of animation and has a cute, very enjoyable first half. The latter half not only makes you sorely miss all of it, but also replaces it with lectures (albeit short), a depressing attitude towards youth that go abroad for better prospects, and very avoidable religious connotations.","Many a time, storywriters use stories to put across their ideologies before their audience. Now, the writing style might be great, or at the very least likable. But, if a reader/viewer doesn't subscribe to the ideology, the writer has lost that one member of the audience. And with Bhoothnath, I am that member. I was a captive audience till it started beating the well-trodden path of stereotypes and meddling with religious issues. What I call religious issues actually borderlines on faith. Especially, if the specific Hindu rite mentioned is only symbolic of the idea that parents only need a gesture of acceptance, of love. While, it might not be far-fetched, I doubt that is what too many viewers will take away. The point being that instead of imposing religious traditions by using a particular practice as an example, if a larger, more global sub-plot was chosen, the point might have gotten through better. A lot of the blame could also go to the absolutely unforeseeable slack in pace and change in execution style. From creative and cute use of otherwise-oft-seen special effects, we are sent to a second half where the magical treats do a vanishing act. From a fun, adorable chain of events, we are suddenly thrown into a rather gloomy outlook of society. From a first half with two fairly well developed characters, we are abruptly introduced to new characters and their half-baked relationships post-interval. Fortunately though, the performances do not suffer from this inconsistency. Amitabh Bachchan plays the grandfatherly ghost, Bhoothnath, who won't let anyone stay in his house even though only his spirit can inhabit it. His comic timing is as impeccable as ever. Not to worry, Amitabh fans - the funny faces, the angst of a person who is worried for someone close, the grief-stricken eyes at the memory of a painful event - all are very much there, the debacle called RGV ki Aag hasn't taken any of it away from him. The only area where he came across as superficial was when the angry ol' man was required to be angry. Sad but true.Anyway, looks like little Aman, who plays naughty Banku, has taken a leaf or more from the veteran's book. Every time Aman Siddiqui came on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off his eyes - such innocence, such twinkle, such sadness - as and how the story demanded. Same goes for Juhi Chawla who plays her cheerful self, this time as a mother with an unbelievable sense of humor. But come scenes that require her to be anxious and her glycerinated eyes make her work seem effortless.I usually refrain from commenting on the special appearances, but Shah Rukh Khan's presence was a little more than just a special appearance. It wouldn't be unfair to say that he had more screen presence than some of the other side characters. Shah Rukh Khan plays Shah Rukh Khan Banku's father. The significance attached to his character's deeds seem like the parts have been forcibly blown-up to fit in the stature of the star. Now, whether he succeeds in performing his role of first-weekend promotional material, the box office will tell in a couple of days.Anyhow, after a long, long time Satish Shah and Rajpal Yadav actually made me laugh. But where did they disappear in the latter half of the movie. And there start my complaints. Keep in mind that I let go of the usual issue related to non-defined super-powers. As in, why does Bhoothnath show himself, if he doesn't want to be seen? So, every time, I saw a cool usage of graphics, I hoped that they won't overdo it, and they didn’t. I was happy. Every time, it looked like the story is going to go into predictable zone, an unexpected line brought out loud laughter. I was happy. I thoroughly enjoyed the comment on TV soap operas. Things were going really well till my questions started getting answered. Then, I asked, ""Where's the conflict?"" There it came, not good, not bad...a little longer and this would have become too serious to match the tone of the movie so far. ""Where's Bhoothnath's backstory? What's his problem?"" And I asked for too much. The movie blindly nosedived into new characters with 45 minutes to go. One of them is Bhoothnath's son, who not only is introduced so late, but has a full character arc, rapid transition et al, albeit very under-developed. I found the little speeches a little too boring and the stereotype against Indian emigrants a bit too harsh. Ultimately, the resolution to the story as a whole was the biggest let-down of them all.All said and done, Bhoothnath surely deserves credit for not taking its younger target audience for granted. Well executed ""tributes"" to the animation used in the Harry Potter series, ensures that the kids get a quality product. If only, they had maintained it through to the end, if only...

Though it is a tad too naïve and preachy, and a little too long for it's own good, the film attempts to make a point that a number of us can learn from; it is a well-acted film with some genuine moments. ","*I am out on a vacation. Pradeep has been kind enough to review the film for wogma. So here goes...    ~ meetu* It is election season, so obviously Hindi cinema can't be expected to not cash in on the fervour. Bhoothnath, the ghost who failed miserably in attempting to scare the bollocks out of little Banku is back. This time, he has another kid for company, and this time, he's taking on the establishment.Watching Amitabh Bachchan taking on the system has historically always been fun. This time though, he's doing it a little tongue-in-cheek, without landing any of those fearsome kicks that have left many a backside sore. Nitesh Tiwari, co-director of Chillar Party, gives us a film that easily surpasses the first one.Bhoothnath Returns has its heart in the right place. After his escapades from the first film, Bhoothnath makes his way to some sort of ghost headquarters, known as Bhoothworld, where he is a laughing stock for being a ghost who couldn't scare even a little child. (Presumably every country has its own Bhoothworld, because in the land shown in the film, every ghost is Indian.) Bhoothnath then returns to Earth to make amends, where he gets sucked into a political battle with a crafty politician.The film is quite funny in spurts, in a really sweet, genuine way. The humour is clean, and at times it is so innocent that you can't help a smile or a chuckle, even if you aren't actually tickled by the jokes. For example, keep a look out for all the signboards in Bhoothworld - they remind you of a time when there was no intent to be extra-smart in cinema, just the wish to make an understated point.The real story of the film begins when our ghost decides that he wants to stand for elections. Now the thing is, if you aren't able to wrap your head around this unlikely premise, then there's no chance at all that you'll even want to see the point that the film is attempting to make. There are certain films where one just must suspend their disbelief, and this film is one of those.Because really, the film has an important message for us all - the fact that it is important to be an active participant in the democratic process, that it is important to take the onus of selecting your candidate, if you don't want a candidate thrust down your throat. It's good to see that the film takes on the more general problems that one would face with a corrupt politician in power, rather than equating him to any of our real life elected villains.Amitabh Bachchan also shares a warm camaraderie with a little boy who goes by the unusual name 'Akhrot', which means walnut. Played with spunk by child actor Parth, he's essentially the soul of the film. In fact, despite terrific performances by Mr. Bachchan and Boman Irani as the politician Bhau, it is little Akhrot's character that propels the film in the directions it chooses. After all, the little children of today are the future. They're the ones who'll be more affected by the choices we make today. The film also has a host of good character actors in smaller roles, who appear one after the other through the film. Brijendra Kala and Sanjay Mishra - both of whom were last seen in Ankhon Dekhi - are quite outstanding. Watch out also for a couple of superstar cameos, and for one scene involving a well known Indian film director who plays himself.The thing is, if the average Indian wasn't gullible or apathetic, then one could have made a serious film that tackles the message that Bhoothnath Returns does. The film is a little too preachy, a little too naïve at times. Essentially it is a film that would work well to educate children on the importance of the citizen in democracy. Unfortunately, it seems that is also the only way to educate adults as well.Another time, another place, one would say that while Bhoothnath Returns is better than its predecessor, it isn't particularly a must-watch by itself. This election season, however, one can't help wonder that, even though Bhoothnath Returns isn't nearly the political film we deserve, it is perhaps the one we need right now.

And therein lies the irony of human nature. ","What can you say about a film made on a true-life disaster? Not a natural disaster. A disaster created more by human apathy than by greed; more by turning a blind eye to the things you can fix than keeping yourself covered; more by believing you are doing the right thing than by convincing yourself that you did your due diligence; more by shirking your responsibilities than by being unapologetic about your negligences. The incident itself was of course unfortunate, and Bhopal - A Prayer for Rain brings about the events that led up to the eventual disaster in an engaging format.That's the problem with commenting about such films. People died and are suffering 30 years later. And how what I have to say is that the film was ""engaging"". What do I say? Rajpal Yadav and Tannishta Chatterjee did a wonderful job of playing Dilip, a Carbider and Leela, his wife as representatives of thousands of workers/families who died in the gas leak and its aftermath?Sure, the camerawork created claustrophobia and not only in the climax scenes. Throughout the film there is a sense of foreboding, a feeling that you are crammed in place which you can't get out of. This comes through even in the long shots of the slum areas and the city of Bhopal in general. It is interesting indeed that director, Ravi Kumar picked a story format over making a documentary. In fact, he adds a touch of dark humor too, in the beginning. The stories of Dilip, Leela and a few more characters which are based on real-life characters keep things as close to reality as possible. Though Warren Anderson's character seemed rather muted and ambiguous through the film. It was difficult to make out what his stand was, maybe a good shade of grey that he really was. Yet, it didn't feel complete. But, the film gives you space to absorb. Not only the technical details - which I am sure they must've over-simplified for the sake of consumption/or because of lack of available data - but also the dynamics that go on in a real life situation. Between politicians and businessmen, between workers and superiors, across races. As you see the Indians on-screen being enamored by anything American, you try to discount the fact that this was 30 years ago, and Indians were indeed in awe of any human with white skin. And then, you wonder. Would my blood boil less as the end credits rolled, if Union Carbide was an Indian company? Does it matter that one of the main reasons (as pointed out in the film) for the disaster was because of an Indian solution, a (jugaad of sorts? Are the senior employees, Indians included, less responsible for the gross negligence that they allowed? And then, you wonder, so what if I get the answers to my questions. What will change? What will I do? The fact that the film made me think, is its success, of course. As I walked out of the theater, I overheard a young girl say over her phone, ""Oh I need to take a break, I just saw a very sad film."" Should I then be saddened further because my cynicism was just reinforced? Or should I be happy that at least the girl came down to see this film? How does one respond to such a film? At the very least by watching it first?~ ~ ~ps. I saw the Hindi version of the film. I must say Martin Sheen speaking in Hindi is very distracting. But, most of the characters are Indians, so it's not that bad once you get past the dubbing.

The Big Lebowski reveals much about the Coen Brothers’ penchant for making films that stand out because of the comically dark treatment of their stories. With near-iconic characters that stay with you much after you’ve watched the film, it’ll surely make you go, “Dude, what in the world was that?” A word of warning: The film may just convert you to Dudeism – try googling that. ","Every once in a while comes a film that clearly demarcates its success into extremes. It’ll bomb at the box office and no more than a couple of years later you’ll see it gaining immense cult status. Films like 
Blue Velvet, 
Reservoir Dogs and, closer to home, Andaz Apna Apna, failed at the box office but gathered fans through their home video releases. Some films are destined to be a bigger success through underground appreciation. If the filmmakers got a penny for every time someone highly recommended these films over a casual conversation, they’d be calling themselves James Cameron. And that’s the beauty of watching a film like The Big Lebowski.Even though Fargo  and No Country For Old Men  are considered the gems, The Big Lebowski adds to their credit like a trigger. From the casting to the dialogues to the surrealistic depiction of what can only be summed up as being inside a stoner’s head, the entire experience makes you go “whaaaa?” in a salutary way. The film surrounds Jeffery Lebowski (Jeff Bridges, also 2010’s Best Actor Academy Award winner) or the Dude as he refers to himself and prefers everyone to refer to him as. He gets caught up in a series of events because he shares his name with a millionaire. All of it is hilarious because here’s a bowling enthusiast who couldn’t be happier smoking weed, drinking White Russians and calling himself a pacifist, who gets unnecessarily involved in a tumbling situation. Accompanying him are his two friends, John Goodman (Walter Sobchak), a Vietnam veteran and Donny (Steve Buscemi) his bowling mate. The best part about the film is the funny and edgy nature of the characters. Goodman is everything the Dude is not, with a violent temper and his willingness to settle everything with a gun. Donny is thick-headed and gullible, and they provide for admirable side characters for someone like the Dude. Apart from these three, you have Julianne Moore playing a feminist artist, Tara Reid playing a nymphomaniac wife, Philip Hoffman playing a secretary who acts as the mediator between the two Lebowskis and the sassiest of the lot, with his Italian mafia-esque accent and loud dressing, John Turturro. Referred to as Jesus, Turturro (one of the Coen brothers’ stock actors) plays a bowling opponent to the Dude and his friends. Each character has been depicted with a hilarious background score, and all of them come together to make for a series of bizarre, amusing scenes. Also watch out for the cowboy narrator who refers to the story as some age-old legend, with epic characters. The special features on the DVD are not that exciting, apart from a set of photographs by Jeff Bridges and a 25 minute making of The Big Lebowski. Also featuring are short interviews with Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, and of course Coen staples Steve Buscemi and John Turturro. But if you need one reason to go buy the DVD, it is the fact that a whole religion has emerged out of a character from the film. Dudeism is now a full-blown religion, with Dudeist churches and priests spread across the US, all advocating The Dude’s philosophy and lifestyle. Dude, now that is cult status!

","When you have a successful franchise in your hand that had survived three decades of viewership, any maker would want to expand the frontiers. While his counterpart in the Don series moved forward with the story, the Ultimate Star of Tamil films decided to tread a different path, that of going back in time to tell the genesis story of David Billa (the Tamil version of Don).  While an original story usually stresses on the formative days of the titular character, with Billa, the urge to see the history of the much revered Don surmounts thanks to the insufficient material available on the reclusive gangster. But five minutes into the movie, with the best dialogue of the trailer wasted terribly, I suspected dreadful times await me. As it happened, after 2 long hours, Billa-2 stood as a testament that any film, no matter how good a star it has, how tech-savvy & creative technicians are involved, will only be as good as the creative vision of the director at the helm of affairs. The problem I had with Billa-2 is not that it couldn’t justify the hunger for violence of the protagonist; we have after all welcomed many a maniac who just want the world to burn. I didn’t even mind the fact that the film was monotonously only about the escalation of a rampant man. Hell, I could even tolerate a plump hero whip and win over his masculine enemies in a jiffy.  But the issue really was about the convincing factor deployed in it. You really can’t make an action movie with the action sequences being its weakest link. From the opening sequence fight, till the much talked about helicopter fight scene, nowhere did the violent rage that seeps out of David Billa’s face fill the screen space. As a result we are only able to see computer generated blood bursting out of the cadaver even before the knife touches it.On the hindsight, with wonderful punch lines and some well-intended scenes that ebb out of the crevice, like a much needed crest after a long trough, Billa-2 did have its moments now and then, making me wonder why the writers couldn’t be more diligent in the work. Had the creators understood that taking the audience to the coda is as important as the coda itself.Billa-2 sure would have been an adrenaline pumping movie. Unfortunately in its present form, Billa-2 is nothing more than the 2 hours stretched version of its 2 minutes trailer with 1 hour 48 minutes of boredom. If at all the film answers something, it tells an origin story where a plump Ajith Kumar walks all the way to become the trim & fit Billa in the 2007 film.

""Hey...even if you can't see me, you won't miss the star who offends politicians... that's ...ME!""Even if the credit rolls claim that Shah Rukh Khan's appearance in Billu is only incidental, each frame has a heavy Shah Rukh aftertaste along with posters and songs from almost all his movies. When he's not on screen, awe for his character (Sahir Khan) is persistently thrown around. And Sahir is so strinkingly similar to Shah Rukh that it's hard to think of him as Sahir. And this feels like you are having Shah Rukh for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. That is, you are choked up to your throat with the adulation for him. The boasting needs some serious toning down. Sure, modesty is for losers and kings don't need to be humble. Especially when humility is left to the other character, Billu. Yes, the story is about Billu - his diffidence, his friendship, his dignity. Irrfan plays it with such intensity that this simple, believable character gets me attached to him. Unfortunately, the attachment is not used any further. It just lays hanging out there for the most predictable thing to happen. This is the bane of a high-profile production house film. You know how it's going to end. So what's left to the writers is to engross you with how it gets there. No number of item numbers with superstars in bikini bras can replace the need for a strong conflict and a charming resolution. The climax does have its emotional peak but it gets there only after a few eye-rolls through a long, long spiel.  And it wouldn't have worked one-bit if it weren't for Irrfan's confused, dazed eyes. Just like the village-fool Billu, endears himself to you, the witty dialogues stick a smile on to your face for a good length of the first half. It begins to wear out slowly but never fades away completely. It does carry its share of sms-forward jokes but it's such a relief to see Priyadarshan restrain himself from the usual loudness his recent films carry. It also doesn't hover around side-issues and sticks to its very basic plot. He also comments on this star-struck nation we are. How we use this star-craziness to make our uninteresting life meaningful. And in this crowd there can be a simple person who is content with what he has. Yet the crowd won't let him live in peace. They'll make a hullaboo, create havoc, belittle him and make him doubt himself. We also have a potential answer to the recession. Get a movie-shoot going in every corner of the world. Not a bad idea! I, for one, will not complain. But, the down-to-earth character is surrounded not only by characters with superficial needs but also with artificial surroundings. The houses and other surroundings are painted and then color corrected/saturated to give a very synthetic feel to the already orchestrated frames. They take away from the otherwise possibly earthy look a film set in the interiors of the country could have carried. Though Lara Dutta as Billu's wife is convincing by her performance, she doesn't gel with the village milieu. Mostly because of the way she's dressed up. While a lot of it has to do with how differently her sari is draped from the other villagers, the almost-backless blouse is a certain giveaway. Even the supposedly-carelessly done hair looks composed. Anyway, you have Shah Rukh mocking himself and the films he works in, but lately we've seen him do that often enough. Who am I to doubt that an entire village can go crazy with a film actor showing up in their vicinity? I'll buy that. But don't choke me with it.

77,175,175,175,175,Bioscope,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review,/movie/bioscope-review/,,,,3.766666667,"Poetry’s transitioned to film - worth watching, but this one offers no scope for true storytelling.","Four directors. Four poets. Four shorts. One movie. Anthology. A rarely-entered territory. Poetry’s reincarnation as a film. A never-done-before, ambitious experiment. A new beginning... Don’t let such publicity ploys hinder your movie-watching experience. A film is a film, irrespective of whether it’s a compilation of short films or is adapted from one form to another. It is still supposed to engage you. No matter how simple they sound, we need better ways to recite tales and not some new form alone. As far as Bioscope is concerned, it isn't a bad experiment. But it doesn't experiment with the narrative.Poetry itself is such that its adaptation into some other form, say films, leads to abstraction all around. This is where Bioscope impresses through its clear-cut notion, with poetry as its backbone. Be it a 'ghazhal' singer’s declining state in Dil-E-Nadan or a broke, but gritty farmer in Bail or a guy’s emotional conflict with his dark complexion in Ek Hota Kau or a young lady struggling with her sexuality in Mitraa, you instantly feel emotional touch in each. Straightforward on the face of it, each story comes with a unique voice, even as the lyrical voiceover plays along. But then, the whole point goes off the mark in conveying the echoes of these characters believably.Interpreted from Mirza Galib’s verses, Dil-E-Nadan reminisces a sorry tale of diminishing 'gharana' music. Draped in rich, elaborate setting, it comes loaded with a lot of detailing and a strong inner voice. Now with no plot development, except in the end, everything is fed through forced dialogue. Nothing wrong with your dialogue telling the story, but it is when only dialogue is doing so. But being a Gajendra Ahire film, I am not surprised. This man seems to shoot his films even before an idea is fully conceived, without worrying about the perils. As this short switches between Marathi, strongly-worded Urdu and Hindi, I wish I could turn off the audio. Very pretentious.Then comes the long-standing tale of our stigma with dark skin, Ek Hota Kau. In this brilliantly acted and poorly shot short, the link between the character and a crow is the real highlight. And so is the sound design that tries to take you into the protagonist’s turbulent mind. Saumitra’s ode is just fabulous to say the least. Nothing particular happens in terms of writing here. The human conflict intrigues nonetheless. This is a simple love story and needs no more than a simple treatment. Yet, you see GoPro-esque visuals showing off technical know-how.Loknath Yashwant’s Bail talks about an animal’s displeasure, and it sounds promising. The moment it is adapted into this Girish Mohite short, it goes haywire. Whose viewpoint is being construed - the animal or the director? In any case, I couldn’t connect with any of them – except the poetry itself. The outburst of this cotton farmer makes Bail a standard, formula film. I understand the never-ending plight of farmers, or maybe I don’t. But this needlessly dramatic portrayal doesn’t win my empathy. Easily the most forgettable in the lot, Bail goes wrong in every department.If you hate all of the above, no worries. The best is saved for the last. The differentiating factor in Ravi Jadhav’s Mitraa is that unlike the others, it’s not just a social film. It presents a stark picture of things you know already just like the rest of the shorts. But its beauty is that the story begins with the audio of Nehru’s ‘Tryst with Destiny’ speech. I would let you figure out what it means to Sumitra and her world. One may overlook this symbolic detailing over the course until a message rolls in the end. But, there is no hastiness to be showy. Commendable effort on Jadhav’s part this time. And he doesn’t just wondrously account Sandeep Khare’s poem, but Vijay Tendulkar’s short story too.When such short stories with uneven qualities are packaged together into a feature, I start to have serious doubts about its purpose. A supposed, new direction actually lacks directional firepower. May be we will have Chaitanya Tamhane, Avinash Arun, Nagraj Manjule or Umesh Kulkarni changing that trend in the next experiment. Who knows? By the way, Kulkarni is coming up with his own experiment next week. Wow!

But it puts these points across in a dull, jerky manner and often without energy. Not discardable, neither enjoyable.","Bittoo Boss feels like a vehicle that is approaching the end of its life. It troubles you while taking off, giving you a sinking feeling that it's not going to run at all. Then it suddenly kick-starts, and just when it looks like it could give some mileage, it jerks and stalls before finally dying on you. Given that Bittoo Boss wants to awaken its audience to the vanity of the porn industry, the narrative it uses is alternately decent and preachy. And the latter is where it gets annoying, not to mention what happens between the two is amateur and leap frog-ish, jumping from point A to point B without using a reasonably understandable flow.For example, the way the lead lady, Mrinalini (Amita Pathak) falls in and out of love is unconvincing each time it happens - both the ins and the outs. Similarly, our man Bittoo's (Pulkit Samrat) choice of career change is rather sudden given his ideologies thus far. Yet, what happens after this, is a tiny bit unpredictable in that typically a hero whose self-respect has been hurt in the name of money, would usually fall prey to all the no-nos before realizing it's not him. But Bittoo is rather self-aware in comparison. This is a pleasant surprise and he wriggles his way out smoothly even if it is a little too easily. There was something about Pulkit Samrat that didn't gel well with me in the promos, but he sort-of grows on me in a very Ranveer Singh, a la Band Baaja Baaraat kind-of a way. Except for his hair, even though my brain told me often enough that that's what a lad from the interiors who thinks he's cool, would think is cool. There are moments in the second half where Pulkit shows his care for other characters with the warmth in his eyes. That it was very sudden and in the face, is a totally different issue. Amrita Pathak, acted well, but also constantly reminded me of my struggle between being unhappy with only good-looking people in the lead and having to sit 2+ hours looking at not-so good-looking people as a part of the audience. The problem here was also, that the lady doesn't have that screen presence which could have covered up for the non-glamorous persona she has. The quirky cabbie-cum-assistant that Bittoo enrolls in the second half looks awful and yet has an awesome screen presence. That actor (name anyone? - Ashok Pathak, thanks for the information Pradeep!) is one of the takeaways for me from Bittoo Boss, despite being sleazy. Another takeaway, is the subtle way in which Bittoo Boss tries to point out that there is a lot beyond sex that goes on in a bedroom and that is where the crux of our emotions lie. And that sex is the most innocent expression of all. Agree or disagree, a pretty insightful thing for a film to try to say. Unfortunately, Bittoo Boss also ends up getting preachy about it. That and that it goes haywire in the last twenty minutes with all sorts-of new dimensions being added to the mix. Moreover, the entire film misses a zing, an energy (that shows only in the first song) that can hold attention. wogma presents ''Bittoo ne le li"" contest in association with Bollywood and Fashion.

I don't think it is - for a movie that falls into the 'reality' genre. The content needs a lot more depth than this one had. Also, I just didn't understand the purpose of the movie. Was it to tell people how bombs are made or to tell terrorists not to terrorise? I think such movies receive more attention than they deserve due to the controversy they create.","Black Friday is a very well made movie; the technical aspects are par excellence and live up to the expectations of the genre. The acting is at its best, the background music is very well used, and the locations and sets seem as real as they could be. But the narration style is not gripping at all. This movie is being advertised as a movie about 'the truth'. So there's the usual gore, the regular torture in prison cells, the typical yelling and pleading associated with a crime, and the investigation thereof. The strange thing is that not a single cop was bribed during the inquiry and you don't see one politician through the movie. Was it really so easy for the police to get all the information about this act of terrorism as is portrayed in the movie? And by the way, if this movie is 'the truth', all our other movies that show greedy police officers and politicians and claim to be fictitious, etc - they are actually telling the truth! These dishonest people in the bureaucracy are a figment of imagination! The movie is not about one police officer, one terrorist or one victim. It is about the bomb blasts. It is a dispassionate, non-judgmental account. It is like reading a newspaper, gives you the details of the way things supposedly happened. Of course, the visuals and language are much more graphic than a few pictures in print. Kay Kay Menon (Additional Police Commissioner), Pawan Malhotra (Tiger Menon) and Aditya Shrivastav (Badshah) do full justice to their roles. But the characters (except Badshah) are not sketched out very well and the non-linear presentation does not help. In fact it adds to the confusion of the long list of names and the inter-connections.Also, what exactly is the aim here? Is it to tell the world, ""this is how ammunition is smuggled into India, this is how terrorists were trained, and this is how it was planted""? There is nothing shocking about the answers to any of these questions. Obviously, if there were bomb blasts, someone-somewhere got the raw material and organized the whole operation.  Is the aim, then, to tell both the Hindu and Muslim fascists how this is not what God wants? If it was so easy to convince the fundamentalists, then wouldn't half the problems in the world be over by now? And I surely hope the aim is not to tell Tiger Menon and Dawood Ibrahim, ""We know what you did thirteen years ago?"" By the way, in the middle of all this, was I supposed to feel bad for the terrorist?No, I certainly don't expect every movie to have a list of aims and objectives. But, for a serious movie of this caliber, a much clearer purpose is needed. Especially when the previews have bold, red letters on a black background that read ""the 'real' contender for the Oscars"", a little more than a documentary is expected. Unless, of course, you are hoping for a nomination in the ""documentary"" category.

80,178,178,178,178,Black Swan,Owner's Pride!,wogma review3 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/black-swan-review/,,4/5.0,,3.4,"Black Swan is Darren Aronofsky’s best work and a benchmark, he may not be able beat. A nearly flawless film, it is also a triumph in terms of performance by an actress in a leading role and Natalie Portman deserves every accolade she has won for winning Best Actress at every major Awards show. The film plays out like a tragic opera -- there’s a great original score, as is the photography - making the experience totally immersive. Once this film gets over, you’ll feel like you’ve been shot. Watch it on the big screen, before it runs out of theatres.","Darren Aronofsky, the director of films like Pi, Requiem For A Dream, The Wrestler has achieved the almost perfect film with Black Swan. The flaws, even if there are any, do not seem obvious and attempts to find any, are equivalent to finding a needle in a haystack.Based on the character of ballerina Nina, who in her quest for perfection, soon begins to lose her mind trying to play the coveted central roles in a ballet, this film is a gripping psychological thriller, from start to finish. In the process, the director visits the human body’s fragility yet again, as he did in his previous films (Requiem For A Dream dealt with the body succumbing to drug abuse, The Wrestler dealt with a fighter’s body). Aronofsky gives life to the unforgettable character of Nina, played out by a devoted Natalie Portman, a role the actress’ contemporaries would kill for.Aronofsky begins the film very much like a docu-drama, the camera following Nina’s character closely - a style he has polished over his previous films. I still can’t stop marvelling at how little time it took him to establish Nina’s character, shed a tear or two on her selection in the ballet, cringe every time she peeled off dead skin off her fingers and toes, nurse a wound on her cracked toenails. Graphic, disturbing and gory. After you’ve been wowed by Nina’s condition and the director’s setup, the supporting cast takes over - Lily (Mila Kunis), Nina’s sensuous, carefree nemesis; Thomas (Vincent Cassell) her promiscuous instructor and Nina’s mother (Barbara Hershey), a former ballerina herself.The film largely centres around Nina and Lily - one charming and graceful, and the other, who has no qualms in letting go and losing herself. Ironically, those are just the qualities Nina is required to portray in her opera performance, a challenge she becomes obsessed at perfecting. Portman’s year long training and dedication towards her role, are totally Oscar-worthy and I’m glad that it’s at least the one choice that is unanimous.Jealousy, competition, regret, pushing the limits, fantasy - are the major threads the screenplay weaves in. But the biggest thread is that of obsession. I’ve seen people being obsessed with their looks, with their Blackberry phones or about handbags, but an artist’s obsession with perfection is something else, because it is something you work towards, laboriously. Especially, for a role so challenging, where you are required to transition from the good guy to the bad guy, flawlessly. Portman’s premise that is entirely believable, sympathetic and tragic.And while this is happening, two parallel stories - that of Nina and Swan Lake - seem to switch sides. In her quest to perfect the character of Black Swan, Nina increasingly finds herself internalising that creature, thanks to her relationship with Lily. She becomes like an ugly duckling, rebellious and bold and meanwhile, the same character in Swan Lake longs to become like Nina’s earlier self, the White Swan - pure, attractive and controlled. Redemption happens, but on a side where you do not expect. What makes the transition so fluid, is some consistently well-choreographed hand-held photography by Mathew Libatique. I used the word ‘choreographed’ because I realised the camera movement during the opera, was as graceful and on a tiptoe as every ballerina performing. That, accompanied with Clint Mansell’s original background score, elevate the film to new highs. The climax is a through-and-through goosebump-cum-wow sequence, riddled with twists and surprises. You’re left guessing, what next and when it all comes to an end, you murmur, “Oh my God.” I did, and I stuck, sinking myself into the film even after it was over. To borrow a phrase from Navjyot Sidhu, Black Swan hit me like a tracer bullet. There are good films and there are bad films. And there are films which are in a league of their own, surpassing our expectations of the medium. Darren Aronofsky has made one such film.

A half-decent plot ain't good enough to make a gripping movie.,"Haven't we had an overdose of movies based on religious fanaticism and associated terrorism already? May be not...Okay, haven't we had more than our share of stories told in the same mundane fashion? I say enough already!First credit where it's due. The base story is not bad at all. It has its interesting plot-twists. The sub-plots sort-of flowed into each other too!! The other thing that I enjoyed was the music. Unfortunately, this list stops here.The battle is completely lost in the filling-in of the details. The characters cannot be called underdeveloped, but they are unbelievably one-dimensional.  One character is just shot out of the plot just about when his character could have done something interesting. It is hard to digest when a character behaves the exact same way when he is being friendly with someone and when a close relative passes away.  Even if he is the modern-day Gandhi. How can one be speechlessly grieving in shock in one moment and lecturing on tolerance in the other. Almost each character spieling out speech after speech on either tolerance or intolerance, doesn’t help either. Each lecture consists of the same old, mind-numbing lines. Each line being repeated begs us to be thankful if they are two different sentences saying the same thing. Because at other times, the same words are repeated - asking us to be sympathetic towards the dialogue writer for being creatively-challenged. And one character who certainly shouldn't have been encouraged was the ""poet"" grandfather figure. The lyrics were just inane, sir, let alone inspirational. Anil Kapoor certainly has a wider range of expressions than this. Anurag Sinha again, has a great voice but a very monotonous style of delivering dialogues. Shefali Chaya should be admired for trying her best to maintain composure while playing a rather loud character. I would still blame the character development for the lackluster performances. They had a very good reason to pick a tone and stick to it - the script has no variation in their character!There is one redeeming factor in this whole set-up - we have seen much, much worse from Subhash Ghai

A film that grips you despite technical limitations, it will startle and shock you while it lasts. ","Why is it that we, supposedly the most intelligent species on the planet, fail to recognize and respect every beating heart of every single being that belongs to any one of the millions of living species that we share our world with? The perverseness of humankind, particularly with our blatant disregard for the natural world around us, is no secret. Every once in a while, though, this lack of understanding and respect for the diverse and intriguing flora and fauna of our world can lead to horrifying and gruesome consequences, especially when what lies behind this is pure financial greed - a fact that is gut-wrenchingly exemplified in Gabriela Cowperthwaite's documentary, Blackfish.The film narrates a series of stories surrounding a killer whale (also known as an Orca,) named Tilikum, which was responsible for the deaths of a number of experienced whale trainers. Continuously gripping, often shocking but mostly just intensely moving and horrifying - all at once, Blackfish shows you both sides of the relationship that a human and an animal can share - it can be both, fulfilling as well as grotesque. Tautly narrated, relying primarily on archival footage and interviews of former trainers at SeaWorld a (dolphin amusement park), where Tilikum still remains, the film wastes no time in grabbing you by the gut and holding on to it right until it ends. It takes you through a range of emotions - from pure joy when you see what seems to be unadulterated love between a human being and a killer whale, to deep, dark, larger questions about whether everything that we see and feel is just a mirage.Also, an animal lover will truly be fascinated by the tiny glimpse that the film gives you, into the fascinating species of dolphins that killer whales are. Undeniably gorgeous, they're also highly intelligent, evolved creatures that seem to be just as capable of feeling complex emotions as human beings. The film's grainy, low resolution images almost never distract you, because the stories that it narrates and the emotions of some of interviewees are so genuine, so real, that you get taken in by it all. When you walk away from Blackfish, then, you're left with mixed feelings. The film is terrific, yes, but it makes you wonder if human beings as a species are the worst things that could have happened to a world as unique as Earth. It is only the tears that you see - and perhaps feel somewhere deep within - that remind you that what always comes with being a human being, is hope.

Blackmail is wacky and has those weird plots. But, the zany business is not all good and the plot gets too convoluted. The other stuff is slow, repetitive and even derisive. That leaves you with the interesting one-line plot – a dull and bored man finds out his wife is cheating on him and decides to blackmail the wife’s lover who in turn blackmails the wife (yes, his lover), with a few other blackmailers thrown in. When expanded, this plot is intentionally filled with ludicrous situations and reactions that want to get a laugh out of you. But, as a person who never understood adult comedy or toilet humor (unless it’s the Piku kind), it is very difficult for me to find masturbation or an obsession with toilet paper funny. Maybe the former is with an intention to point fingers at how real life is for some men but it is too repetitive and thus predictable, for it to be satirical either. Same goes for the relentless objectification and misogyny.Even so, if the movie had been crisper and pacier, the one-line plot might just have worked. It doesn’t help that plot-wise, almost everything that happens until interval, is what you already know from the trailer!While the dialogue is not entertaining or engaging, as a saving grace in the writing department Dev, the protagonist’s (Irrfan Khan) lines are conspicuous by their absence. The man has no more than 20-25 lines in the movie. It must take credible restrain for a writer to let the actor take over without their help. And anyone who has seen his work would know what a treat such a character can be when its played by the likes of Irrfan Khan. So, Dev comes across as creepy within the first few minutes of the film. This is Irrfan Khan who has recently announced that he might be diagnosed with something serious. Yet, the man makes you cringe with his onscreen depiction of a person with a distasteful habit. Enough for you to not empathize with him for being cheated on by his wife. Other than the fact that all other actors are likely to fall pale when compared to this performance, it doesn’t even feel like any of them are trying. We have seen Gajraj Rao, Divya Dutta and Omi Vaidya play characters similar to these – quirky, drunken loud and annoying – respectively, for us to remember them in this particular film. Kirti Kulhari wears the same expression through and through. The only standout then would by Arunoday Singh who does his usual dumb, goofball act in the first half, but later in the film he has one scene which takes him beyond anything we have seen him do so far. The music that is used well in the first half hour or so becomes repetitive and tedious through most of the run-time thereafter. Not to mention the item number lengthens and slows down the film by that much more.Blackmail spends too much time to introduce its protagonist and takes too long to establish its basic premise. It actually squeezes out ounce-by-ounce all the interest you came in with because of the trailer and/or the lead actor. It is the kind of film that is not interested in you liking any of the characters, they are all rather nasty people. Is that what the makers are saying, there are no nice people in the world? But, to say that they had that thought behind the story, I would be giving too much credit to them.

84,182,182,182,182,[The] Blind Side,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma reviewNotepad124 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/blind-side-review/,,4/5.0,,2.866666667,"The Blind Side is a real-life story about finding love and family. Michael Oher is a 17-year-old black boy brought up in foster care all his life before he finds home at the Tuohys. With amazingly touching performances from Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron, this film is bound to make you cry.","The Blind Side is a real-life drama about Michael Oher, a football player and his struggles from being an abandoned kid growing up in foster homes to an NFL player. Starring Quinton Aaron as Oher and Sanra Bullock as his adoptive mother, the film has been nominated for Oscars in the Best Actress and the Best Film category.What makes The Blind Side such a compelling movie is the fact that it tells a true-life story of a boy with little or no prospects. The Blind Side however, is not just another underdog movie. It is a film about human relationships, the need to reach out to the ones less fortunate, but most importantly, it's a film about believing in oneself and following one’s convictions even when the whole world might be booing you. The fact that the film is a real-life story makes it an even more compelling narrative. During its two-hour run, the screenplay of The Blind Side shows no signs of flagging; nor does it get into unnecessary details even when there are at least a quarter dozen stories that are dying to be told. Instead, writer-director John Lee Hancock chooses to focus on one and one story only -- that of Michael Oher. Everyone else’s personal tales fade out in comparison. Sandra Bullock who plays Leigh Anne Tuohy surely does a great job. But if there is someone who the Academy has left out it is Quinton Aaron, the six-feet something huge actor who has played the role of the underdog with such conviction your heart goes out to him. In the first part of the movie you see him with just a polythene bag -- the kinds you use for buying fish -- and set of clothes on his back spending nights at the Laundromat or the gym simply ‘because it’s warm in there’. Believe me there is nothing more heart-wrenching than those scenes. Last year the Academy took note of a somewhat unknown actor Richard Jenkins and his role in a little-known film called The Visitor and nominated him in the Best Actor category alongside Sean Penn and Brad Pitt. Looking at this year’s nomination list you wonder why Aaron never made it to any of the categories. We all know what a wonderful actress Sandra Bullock is -- she’s given us very many memorable films over the years. But if you must watch The Blind Side, watch it for the performance of Quinton Aaron.

85,183,183,183,183,Blood Money,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewNotepad32 Critic Reviews 0.5/5.0 52 Tweet Reviews 1.6/5.0,/movie/blood-money-review/,0.5/5.0,,1.6/5.0,3.05,"A strong middle hour sandwiched between twenty minutes of silliness at the beginning and an absurd last half hour, make Blood Money hanging between engaging and ridiculous. A clear indication that the writers didn't quite believe that they had it in them to give Blood Money a fair chance. ","Blood Money reminded me of this incident in school from when I was about 14 years old. We were asked to write an autobiography of a soldier in Marathi. After about 6 pages of turmoil that my soldier went through as prisoner of war, he was suddenly set free because ""The enemy got bored and frustrated with my silence."" The teacher asked me, ""Did the enemy get bored or you got bored of writing?"" That's my question for Blood Money's writer Upendra Sidhaye.After an intense and effective opening sequence, Blood Money falls into the regular zone of 'whatever' - things like, a fresh MBA gets a huge bungalow as a perk in South Africa; a not-so-warm bosses give a settling-in allowance. We have learnt to get over such discrepancies real quick. Especially since, soon enough, you have the wife not only have doubts about their good fortune but voice them too. Not too often do such logical things happen in Hindi films - a husband and wife who talk to each other about their insecurities. That's when I started getting pulled in, despite the annoyingly distracting inane songs. A little surprisingly too, I must add. I didn't expect a film with Kunal Khemu and Amrita Puri to get my complete attention for even a bit. In fact, after a while, I noticed that I had forgotten all about taking notes and just wanted to watch what's going on. The one business deal shown in detail to express Kunal's (Kunal Khemu) aptitude, the way an honest man can get sucked into the unethical because of his ambition, the way he begins justifying his lapses with some excuse or the other. Kunal Khemu does a fine job too of showing both his ambition and disappointment with himself. The audience understands and empathizes with him as they see that his dilemma never leaves him. You see when he's wrong too, but you know he just might mend his ways. The rest of the cast though, are as superficial as can be. While the feminists can be disgusted with the portrayal of a housewife abroad, I liked the way she was shown dependent on her husband in all ways but was the only support he could have is in the strange land. Amrita Puri, though not quite the mannequin she is imagined as in one of the scenes, is not the most emotive either. When her character, Arzoo did have the chance to not sulk, Amrita ended up over-enacting. The only reason Manish Chaudhary caused any scare that a villain ought to, was because of the opening sequence. His stiff dialogue delivery take away from the character, including the said scenes itself. Not to mention the annoying pet word assigned to him. They killed my theory that a pet word/phrase given to a character could work if it were short and from everyday language. Oh well. And yet, I enjoyed how these three characters were written. All of them had a shade of gray, even the villain, Zaveri/Zakaria. He too gave people a chance before deciding that they needed to be put away. The handful other characters though added nothing to the plot. From Zaveri Jr. (Sandiip Sikcand) to Sean (Teeshay) to Nandini (Name?) to to the cop (Karan Mehra) - all seemed mere pawns for the writer to go from point A to point B in the film. While Sandiip and Nandini overacted, thus were annoying, Teeshay and Karan Mehra might have shown us their talent if they had something more to dig their heels into. That brings me to the last half hour of the film. The part where the writers got bored with their job. From a calm potential for brilliant mind games between two intelligent people, it suddenly becomes an action film. It suddenly becomes a thriller. It suddenly gives birth to twists and turns. It immediately becomes material you'll laugh at. It's not that the twists were all bad. But it happens way too fast. I wonder how it'd work out if the same events played out in the even pace that the film ran with thus far. Oh well, that'd be another film. It's always a great feeling to get pulled into enjoying a film that you had very little hope from. But, it is equally bad when the film takes you down with it in a spiral of preposterous  stupidity. Then, you don't know whether to laugh at the makers or yourself for allowing yourself hope. Yet, Blood Money is watchable between ad breaks when it shows up on TV.

It will leave you with a bad after taste of what could’ve been a treat! After a while, you might feel you re watching National Geographic packaged the ‘bollywood ishtyle.’","Blue is a perfectly good example of what money can’t buy-quality. With its expansive canvas, produced at an estimated 100 crores, Blue is a sheer waste of money not only for the financiers but also for the audiences. The crew comprises of two oscar winners - Musician AR Rehman and Sound Designer Resul Pookutty, Pete Zucarini of the ‘pirates of the Caribbean fame’ underwater director of photography, the pop diva Kylie Minogue and a host of stars including Sanjay Dutt, Akshay Kumar, Lara Dutta and Zayed Khan. It’s simple lesson for the first time Director Anthony D Souza that the basic premise for a good movie is a solid script and not star power!In a preposterous statement Anthony D Souza said that it was necessary to restrict the film to less than two hours. But after having sat through the entire 117 minutes (minus the interval which was a relief) the movie could’ve been much shorter. I was actually bored towards the end of the movie. The movie is marred by an almost non existent script, weak dialogues, lack luster music and poor direction. The story is predictable from the beginning itself and therefore lacks the twists and turns that are absolutely imperative for an action packed thriller. Instead of being a roller coaster ride high on adrenaline and volatile circumstances, the movie is prosaic with a ridiculous climax. It is much too slow for a movie of its genre and does not push the viewers to the edge. Lara Dutta was probably the only factor which left the viewers gasping and asking for more!There is no doubt that the movie has its moments. The impressive underwater sequences (Pete Zucarini) especially the one where Sanjay Dutt and Akshay Kumar actually ride a shark will take your breath away. The lighting for the underwater sequences is spectacular and the over all look is chic. It also boasts of some exhilarating action sequences both on land and in water. The bike chase sequence is ‘fast and furious’ which pushes the viewers to the edge. Lara Dutta’s sculptured body adorned by gorgeous bikinis has pushed the oomph meter to unprecedented levels and is a visual treat for all.Blue is set in the sun soaked beaches of Bahamas. Sagar (Sanjay Dutt), a simple guy and a polished deep sea diver befriends Aaraav (Akshay Kumar), a rich ambitious businessman who loves his women and a good life. Lara Dutta (Mona) plays Sagar’s wife and his eye candy. A fat Sanjay Dutt is laughable as a sea diver but gives a good performance otherwise. Akshay Kumar looks uber cool with his grey goatee and a hot body. Zayed Khan’s performance is ignorable and he just cannot emote for nuts. The high point of the film is definitely Lara Dutta who will now give the other actresses a run for their money post her memorable performance in Blue. She looks as fresh as the morning mist and adds panache to her bikini clad character and does not look vulgar at all.The dialogues are absolutely ridiculous and inarticulate. Lara Dutta in a tense moment exclaims amidst bullets and villains, “why don’t you talk and sort things out?” Amazing isn’t it! The dialogues are almost contemptible.The music surprisingly doesn’t click at all. The much hyped Kylie Minogue number “Chiggy Wiggy” is disappointing. The other songs (that I cannot even remember vaguely) have forgettable melodies. The last song “fiqrana” does manage to stay in your head but can be easily replaced. Seems Mr. Rehman is too conscious of his new stature post Oscars and played it much too safe.The director Anthony D Souza must realize that making a good film is not about bulging budget or star power or putting fancy visuals on screen. A good film has its foundation strong on a solid script while the façade comprises of the above mentioned facets in the right combination. Blue could’ve been a defining moment in the history of bollywood but instead is a damp squid.

87,185,185,185,185,Blue Valentine,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review4 Reader Reviews 2/5.0,/movie/blue-valentine-review/,,2/5.0,,1.666666667,"Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at last year’s Sundance Film Festival, Blue Valentine is a disturbing story about love. The non-linear screenplay captures the irony of romance - the burning passions of courtship and the frothing discontent of a marriage on the rocks. Beautifully filmed, written and enacted, I highly recommend you watch this one. If you’ve ever been in and out of love, you’ll need some tissues.","You know something is wrong between a married couple when both of them don’t share the same bed anymore. When they don’t make their rift apparent in front of their daughter, you know that the only thing that’s holding them together is the happiness of the little girl, who neither of them would want to see grow up between parents living apart.Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Mitchelle Williams) are such a couple and their mundane life in the countryside is devoid of any colour that comes with the term ‘happily married’. Dean paints houses for a living, while Cindy is a doctor. Blue Valentine is the story of their falling out of love, while reflecting upon the story of their falling in love.From the first shot itself, the camera establishes their rift with ease, as it desperately tries to capture some eye contact between the two, but finds none. It becomes very clear that for Cindy, Dean doesn’t exist. She wants him to do something worthwhile, not opt to continue as a painter, a job which allows him to drink beer early morning. Dean thinks its okay, because that’s a job that keeps him happy. That’s essentially the source of  the rift - one partner wanting the other person to ‘be’ someone else and not accepting him the way he is. It doesn’t drive her to forge an extra-marital affair, but it doesn’t show her wanting to make an extra effort to make things work either. Cindy appears to be suffering silently. And despite Dean trying hard to make things work - he finds himself losing control of himself, and their marriage.The story of their falling in love is a beautiful one and that alone is what makes their separation a little unbearable for the viewers. There is a beautiful sequence of Dean wooing Cindy, asking her to tap-dance to his music and it is one of my most lasting impressions of the film. Some scenes are so tragic, I ended up shielding my eyes. And it felt gut-wrenching because the screenplay so beautifully establishes the two characters and stitches their two tracks together - the love story and the falling out of it.What disappointed me though, was that the film never made it clear when exactly the tensions between the two began. Was there an incident that sparked off the descent? Did Dean give up a well-paying job offer to settle for his current artistic endeavour? You don’t find answers to these questions. You’re convinced however, that he is a good father, as she is a good mother.The film subtly makes a point about how well a child’s existence can act as a lever to balance a rocky relationship. A child is always a reminder of the passion that brought two lovers together. But Frankie (their daughter) isn’t an ordinary child. And when you see the film, you’ll know why Dean is no ordinary lover, despite Cindy’s declining interest for him. Blue Valentine is memorable thanks to Ryan Gosling’s and Mitchelle Williams’ performances. They’ve enacted their pre-marriage romance and the post-marriage cold vibes so well, your heart reaches out to them, mourning the fall of their relationship. Both won deserving nominations for Best Actor and Actress at the Golden Globes. What I’m sure of, is that you’ll find this film a memorable one. Especially married couples. Director Derek Cianfrance has made an outstanding feature film debut with this one. You’ll enjoy listening to him in the interview that’s the only Special Feature on this DVD.

And oh, none of them a thriller (considering it's a detective story.) ","It must indeed be a difficult task to make a film with a woman at its center. So difficult are they to write stories around them that the movies have to be padded with a romantic track, a couple of songs and so on. Such a shame. Even so, Bobby Jasoos tries. Not only does it try to make a woman-based story work it tries to highlight how life of women in India is kept from reaching its potential. The question then is, can you watch a movie for an attempt at making a woman-centric film?One of the main reasons people were looking forward to Bobby Jasoos is because its a Vidya Balan product. One of the very few female stars who can command an audience just because of her. While, she doesn't fail as an actor, Bobby aka Bilqis, is hardly challenging enough for her. However, it isn't necessary that she take up projects that only challenge her as an actress. Sometimes it is just the subject that needs attention. And who can deny that attention is necessary for the woman who is suppressed by society, treated as just something that needs to be passed on from father to husband at the right age? This part of the writing is done subtly and is indeed very appealing. Unfortunately though, the rest of the film is spread too thin over too many sub-plots. From lovers who need a detective to ward-off proposals arriving for them through the arranged marriage route by looking for ""flaws"" in the prospective applicant to fathers who can't show their love and care directly to their child to lovers who can't own up to their feelings. The main point of intrigue, the mystery itself has a lame resolution and provides no thrill, even though it tries to tie two main threads of the film together. Top this off with the additional pressure of having to be funny and commercially viable. Yes, commercially viable supposedly = dream sequences, no matter how random and out-of-place they are! I cannot think of another reason for the existence of that song. Oh well.Other than Vidya Balan, Ali Fazal has some brief moments that work well. Arjan Bajwa has a screen presence even if it requires him to hold one expression. The rest of the cast too have their share of screen time which they do well with. None of this is good enough though given how many stories Bobby Jasoos, the film is trying to tell. Each distracting from the other, not letting the other come to its point.

That, at least I'm prepared for. The attempt at putting in sorry, convoluted twists just kill whatever other fun you could have had.","Bodyguard's last half hour constantly reminded me of a Chinese curse. 
Fortunately, maybe, all is not lost for Salman Khan fans. There are at least three action packed sequences with slick moves. But somehow, a lot of the credit will be taken by the camera and editing for the ""coolness"".The rest of the time though, he plays the squeaky clean, Lovely Singh. The romance he's involved in drags forever and has a climax that you can laugh out your heart at - not in a good way. And the exact same laughter is brought about every time Salman Khan breaks into a song. No rhyme, no reason, just been a while since the audience has seen Salman Khan move his muscles, so let's edit a song in. The supposedly comic scenes on the other hand barely bring a smile or two. At other times, they bring cringes, especially when the ""comic relief"" side-kick comes on screen. The one thing that I found amusing above all is that Salman Khan is being played around at the hands of a woman. Otherwise, usually the women are thrown around as if they have no brains and are helpless at the hands of their men. That doesn't mean Kareena Kapoor gets a chance to have a pathbreaking performance. She does her usual pretty-young-thing bit, only she gets a little more screen time than otherwise accorded to a non-Salman-Khan in a Salman Khan film. Usually, for a film where only the star of the film matters, I have a disclaimer that the review doesn't apply to the star's fans. But, I doubt even hardcore Salmaniacs will enjoy Bodyguard either. The star however is confident as ever and has a ""I can get away with anything"" attitude. A dialogue in the film goes, ""tumhaari nazar mein tum hero, hamari nazar mein hum hero"" (According to you, you are the hero. According to me, I am the hero). Who would have thought a Salman Khan film could be introspective.

A song every time you pause to take a breath does nothing to help its cause. Please give this one a miss.","One more filmmaker realizes the difference between paper and celluloid. Pravin Raja Karale, the director of Bokad, must have felt that the script in his hand had something in it that drove him to make the film. In fact, I refuse to believe that there is a filmmaker anywhere in the world who sets out to make a film with material that he knows is absolute, universal trash. (Yes, even Sajid Khan.) It is that Tolkien-esque journey from paper to film that makes cinema the very driving force behind the existence of some of us. Bokad has a premise that could easily have sounded convincing on paper. A group of college kids from Mumbai go on a field trip to a village, only to be embroiled in the whims of rural life and the political games that are played at the very grassroots of the gigantic pseudo-democratic edifice that controls our existence. And the village sarpanch's goat is at the centre of it all, like a mute, near-inconsequential metaphor for honour, pride and respect. Ignoring the distinct possibility that none of what I wrote above crossed the filmmakers’ minds, what the viewers end up with is a mess of a film, put together with all the ability required to set up a toddler’s game of ‘house-house’.To make matters worse, the makers decided to go with 20 songs in the film, and I’m not even exaggerating. So one miserably choreographed song with more left feet than in all of the Western hemisphere pops up every five minutes, supposedly to ‘unfold the mystery behind the story’ [sic].The most perplexing aspect of this film is undoubtedly the casting. The unfortunate young men and women playing the collegians also turn up as villagers, reporters and even background extras at various points in the film. I spent much of the first half believing that this was some kind of inspired cinematic decision, giving the makers the credit for doing something so blatantly avant-garde, showing the finger to purists and saving some money at the same time. Eventually however, I came to the conclusion that they were just saving money, cinematic expression be damned. In fact, at various times I felt that Bokad was truly a lost opportunity. There was so much that could have been done when juxtaposing the beliefs and behaviour of Mumbai-based youth in a rural setting. Even something as simple as the yearning for non-vegetarian food is brought up very smartly and then squandered away. Village level politics is also touched upon, then relegated to the sidelines as the focus shifts to tomfoolery and a half-baked love story.Sayaji Shinde and Kishore Kadam, spotted earlier in some of Ram Gopal Varma’s films, are the picks of the cast. Devious theatrics seem to come naturally to these performers, and they have the ability to hold your attention as they flirt dangerously with the boundaries of acting and over-acting. The rest of all of those who walk in and out of frames are just there, like the folded paper one would stuff under a rickety table's leg to temporarily stabilize it.Poor writing and a mediocre cast look even worse when combined with the dated feel of the film. In all of this, it is the goat from the title of the film that gets a raw deal. Talked about throughout, the poor fellow gets barely any screen time at all. Perhaps he was used as a metaphor for this film itself. Bokad is just one of those films that will come and go without so much as a whimper.

He's a social messenger for our children and the child in us. The film though is a bit too sweet to be true.,"Being kind is really not that difficult. Neither does being considerate take a whole lot of effort. And trying to put yourself in the other person's proverbial shoes will not be the end of the world. 7-year old Bokya reminds us of the goodness we carry and appreciate but also forget as we age. Like Aesop's fables, Jataka Tales, Panchatantra are some of the short stories we have grown up with. Dilip Prabhavalkar's Bokya Satbande falls in that category for many kids who understand Marathi. It is amazing how a saccharine character like Bokya is made believable. Every time I saw him say something that sounded a bit too wise for his age, I could picture one of my kids showering me with the same knowledge using similar language. Though they wouldn't necessarily be as thoughtful they are at times as good-naturedly scheming to get what they want. And yet overt, unbelievable melodrama makes its way into the climax. And it is as trying as ever and sticks out sorely.Interestingly while none of the actors do a wow-what-a-great job, they do make their characters immensely adorable. Little Aryan adopts a unique combination of mischief and maturity and is absolutely endearing. And you see his parents, his brother, his grandmother all knowingly and willingly giving in to his manipulation. Oddly enough, Dilip Prabhavalkar who has written the books, the TV series and the screenplay for the film came across as over-doing his bit. While I found his overacting extremely annoying, it seemed intentional because his act made every kid in the house laugh. What makes the film enjoyable, is in a childish sort-of a way very smart. It doesn't once let the kid go out of bounds or make his actions seem unjustifiable. Bokya is naughty but you don't see him behave irresponsibly. Even if it is to cover-up something he doesn't want his parents to know, you see him confide in his grandmother. Some of the lines entertain as much as they enlighten. There are other off-handish remarks that seem funny but are a comment about society today without being sarcastic.In movies that portray someone as overly-good, many a time the ""other"" party is painted a dark, dark black. There's no such attempt to underhandedly highlight the former's brightness here. And there aren't character transformations because of the ""good"" guy's preaching.This is a must watch for all kids - Marathi-speaking or not. Language won't be a barrier to understand humanity. I took a couple of 7-year old non-Marathi-understanding kids and they absolutely loved it. They wouldn't stop yelling 'Boooookya Satbande' for a couple of hours after the film. And well...I won’t shy away from saying that I enjoyed it almost as much too.

It is slow and gets repetitive and preachy about serious topics like mistreatment of the girl-child and sexual orientation. The treatment doesn't let you get too involved.,"Bol leaves you a huge ""something is missing"" feeling. The kind you can't point your finger at. Given the issue at hand, you are expecting a strong and what they call ""hard-hitting"" film. You know it will get preachy, you know it might be slow, you know it will be grim, so you are prepared for all of that. Given a topic as close to heart as ""girl child"" you want to be sucked into the drama and you want to be brought down to tears. But Bol forgets to engage with its focus on creating drama. Bol's strength lies in its story which revolves around a very important topic. The dire situation of the girl child is not unique to Pakistan or Muslims. In remote corners of India, the same bias against giving birth to a girl child exists and it leads to heinous crimes. Bol creates a story around this issue and shows us the flaws in our society. It presents a different interpretation of the Qoran - the logical one, the one that actually glorifies Allah. An interpretation that should put to shame some of the current practices. The only irony is, in all likelihood, the film will never be seen by the people whose mindsets it wants to fight against. I won't be surprised if those people don't believe in watching films at all. But, while making its point Bol becomes repetitive. And that's strange because it touches on two separate and vast issues and a few other issues like child molestation are touched upon. With so much to talk about, it shouldn't have had to repeat itself. Along with the mistreatment of women, it comments upon transgender issues and their plight. But in showing the reality of how people think about these issues, I'm afraid certain misconceptions are reinforced. For example, how did a midwife know the sexual orientation of a child at birth? Is that possible? Maybe, I don't know enough. 
Another factor that might have accentuated the disconnect is the performances. The lead actor, Manzar Sehbai the father of the girls who hated having them, had nothing menacing about himself and yet his wife and daughters were scared of him. He is a character we'd love to hate but he didn't even inspire that emotion. In fact, other than the lead lady, Humaima Malick, who plays the brave daughter, none of the actors made me feel anything for them. Even Humaima Malick's otherwise decent performance is watered down by the opening sequence and her spiel from the jail. And yet, Zainub's tale, her all-important question in the climax are enough for me to recommend the film to you. It's a sad and depressing, longish story. The horrifying thing is real-life is only manifold worse than what is shown here.

Save a few funnies, it is typical nonsense one would expect in a film from this genre. Watch if you have nothing better to do, I say. ","It's a Rohit Shetty film. Which smoothly slides into Anees Bazmee territory and a dash of Priyadarshan 'comedies'. Oh, who am I kidding? Soon, I'm not going to be able to tell the difference. What we know for sure is it is 100% nonstop nonsense. Either you like it or you don't. Or you like the star involved in the ridiculous extravaganza or not. And this time they didn't bother with writing a story. They just picked a classic from yesteryears. Usually with a 'remake' I try to forget/ignore/disregard whatever I know about the original to do full justice to the newer film. But here, try as one might, you aren't allowed to forget the likeness. Time and again, crudely and brutally you are reminded who the makers are paying a tribute to. An exaggerated mimicry of Amol Palekar-Utpal Dutt might work once, but repeating it or making constant references to it only highlights how inept the tribute is. Just calling themselves middle-class doesn't make the characters so, right? The way they dress, whether shoes or make-up deny believability. Oh, there I go again! hmph.So we have Abhishek Bachchan replace Amol Palekar and Ajay Devgan replace Utpal Dutt and you hold back your tears. The interesting point is that this is despite the fact that I like both Abhishek Bachchan and Ajay Devgan as actors. And given the context of the film, the genre, and the director their timing is pretty good and they manage to not annoy you completely despite the characters assigned to them. Especially Abhishek Bachchan as the effeminate Abbas is quite a racket.What I must say is that this must be the best respect(?) homosexuality might have received in mainstream cinema. Sure, he was being laughed at but at least it wasn't mocking and there was some level of acceptance. Some progress. The rest of the cast is as expected, loud and pretty much intolerable except for Asin and Prachi Desai who try to bring in some sort of order and balance to the chaos but of course aren't given enough room. There's a flurry of tributes to other films from Karz to Hrishikesh Mukherjee's other film Khoobsurat. They are all funny conceptually but everything is so loud and disconnected that they work at best as stand-alone one-liners. Not to mention, even the one-liners throughtout the film are no more entertaining than SMS forwards - some jokes at other times inspirational quotes. No, I don't deny it; I wasn't deaf to the resounding laughter at each ridiculous line stuffed with stylized delivery. It's like the Hindi proverb, 'haath kangan ko aarsi kya' that is, 'hand bangle what mirror mirror on the wall?' only imagine that delivered by a muscular Ajay Devgan who makes sure his chest tattoos show just a peek. Yes that's the kind of complete disconnect between the actual proverb, the situation at hand and the humor it tries to use. The humor is indeed to be found in the disconnect. There are a couple instances that are genuinely hilarious. But, the rest of them find their laughs because of how silly it sounds. I, however, could enjoy the humor only a couple of times. Oh, and the action is also a letdown from usual Rohit Shetty standards. Many sequences have the sound design, the camera and the editing do the action instead of Ajay Devgan and Abhishek Bachchan.Everything is too over-the-top, too loud, too in-the-face. There is just way too much room the writers give themselves so that the audience can leave their brains behind. Only that, I am a part of that audience who doesn't want to or rather who couldn't be convinced to. Ps. 'haath kangan ko aarsi kya' means 'you don't need a mirror to look at your bangle/bracelet - you don't need a mirror to see the obvious'

All work wonderfully at some level and don't work as well at other levels. Bombay Talkies worth a watch nevertheless. ,"Could there be a better way to pay tribute to something, than making a contribution to it? Better yet, when the makers' passion for the medium shows in the work. So, then do we show our love for the director who went  out of his comfort zone? Or for the one who did what he always does best - engage us by adding quirk to the simplest of stories? Or for the two in between - he who tells the story of a compassionate father or her who makes a son shine despite his father? Or should we talk about the discontent at what was missing or overdone? Karan Johar steps out of his glamorous shoes which must have been quite difficult. To not resort to lip-sync song and out-of-place dance must have been an effort in itself - even though there was a perfect enough excuse for one, two characters (Rani Mukerji and Saqib Saleem) working on Bollywood gossip. In fact, in contrast to the other three films, the only form in which this short film refers to Bollywood is through songs from yesteryears and dialogue. To top it off, looks like he wasn't allowed to take a trip to snow-capped Europe, much to our relief. (Boy, must that have been a toughie for Karan Johar!) Yet, his is the most chic story in terms of ambiance as he gets to play around with the relatively upper class parts of Bombay. That's as glossy as it gets. Though Karan Johar's quarter of Bombay Talkies seems like the most personal of the short films, it was over-eager. His account of a homosexual man who meets a woman he hits it off with, felt like a story he was dying to tell. That he had this passion to desensitize the Indian audience to this taboo film is great. But, that it came on so hard - not so great. Unfortunately, once again, Johar's approach to the gay world brought out sniggers and worse, 'eeewwws' and 'yucks'.Once done with the weakest of the films in terms of stories, we have Dibaker Banerjee's film about a struggler (Nawazzudin Siddiqui) who takes pride in all his struggles. Till he is shown his shortcomings by his own hallucination. This part of the movie was more about two sequences in the film rather than the film itself. One, with a surreal setting in which the lead character is forced to face reality. And the other is a lovely tribute to silent cinema. Of course, there are many other smaller things which you will discover and there are others which don't connect, but these bits stay with you.Bombay Talkies love for cinema deepens with Zoya Akhtar's Naman, a child stifled by the ambitions of his father. Like many people I know in real life, Naman made lonely and ignored by his parents takes refuge with Bollywood. The God-like stature he assigns to his favorite star is the logical next step. Zoya's gently slaps us as a society, twice. Once with her comment on parents who not only force their ambitions on their children but also corner the kids into lying to them. Then, with us as a society which produces and goes on to popularize songs that shouldn't be heard or seen by kids under ten. It is amazing how we clap while our children dance to these numbers. Her soft and indirect touch to a controversial topic like transvestites too, is pretty brave.And the best is saved for the last. You can trust Anurag Kashyap to combine two disparate topics with finesse - our fanaticism as fans of stars and our unquestioning regard for our parents wishes. He celebrates and taunts both these aspects at one go. Yet, this is the simplest story of them all. Even though it feels a tad too long, the pace and build-up to the climax is beautiful. Vineet Kumar Singh as Vijay looks like another of Kashyap's finds that we ought to watch out for.  His desperation and persistence alone makes this section worth the watch. And of course, you have more bonuses along the way. All this builds up to the promotional song which I hated the first time I saw it on YouTube. But, with the flow of the film it had a completely different feel to it. Also, the version I saw earlier didn't have the complete version, it left out the charming old times. Yet, it deserved better than the green-screen patch job it got for the last bit. And the signature tune assigned for the current generation of actors still didn't work. So, while Karan Johar's story on a man's struggle with his sexuality might be the most impressive in terms of how far he's come out of his box, and Dibaker Banerjee & Zoya Akhtar's stories warm you nicely as tributes to our love for cinema, Anurag Kashyap's bitter-sweet reference to our reverence for stars is easily the one I'd like to watch again. Now, it's difficult to put my favoritism for the director aside when asked to compare. But, then again, given the context, this once I'm allowed that. ;)

Unfortunately, not beyond that though. Before long, the plot starts getting convoluted.","Anurag Kashyap loves killing his characters* in style. His creates violent scenes with as much flair as he creates a Bombay from 40-50 years ago. But, are grandeur in violence and production compelling enough to make it into a memorable film. Yes and no. Bombay Velvet tries to hit you in the gut with its violence but misses because you get distracted by the déjà vu from a Tarantino film. It impresses with style but doesn't leave an impression. It has very interesting characters and a meaty plot but gets contrived.  It is quirky but doesn't go all crazy on you, but it is just enough to keep waiting for something bigger to happen – which not necessarily does. Bombay Velvet starts unfolding characters to introduce them rather than using the usual ploys of voice-over or people who know each other forever but behave, for our benefit, as if they've just met. You actually sense the writers' and director's love for the characters. They build up pretty well too, intriguing you even if not necessarily getting you involved. Balraj (Ranbir Kapoor), a small-time thug, victim of the partition is aspirational and surprises you with his ruthlessness – you don't really expect a chocolate boy to enjoy a good fight. But, that's how obsessed he is with what he wants – a life goal or a woman – he does what it takes and takes joy from it too.  Rosie (Anushka Sharma), a woman oppressed by men all her life wants tender, loving care that she's been deprived of all her life. Meanwhile, she sings and how! Khambatta (Karan Johar) the business tycoon is ruthless in his own way but he won't get his own hands dirty in a hurry. And you have Chiman (Satyadeep Misra) the hero's friend, the alter ego, the audience's representative, the bystander who gapes at it all. They are all ace performances too. When Ranbir Kapoor seems over-eager, it is Balraj's earnestness coming through; Balraj's hot temper sees its way through the blows Ranbir takes and gives with pleasure. (Satyadeep Misra) as the friend stays in the background as would be expected out of Chiman. Unlike his directorial debut, Karan Johar's acting debut makes you look forward to his next performance. My appreciation for the surprising steps that some of the leading actresses in Bollywood have taken goes beyond words. Kangna Ranaut last year, Deepika Padukone last week and Anushka Sharma with NH 10 in last quarter. Though her role in Bombay Velvet did have a certain glamor attached to it, it is not misplaced and Anushka Sharma balances it with the restraint in the non-pub scenes. It is indeed as much an applause to the actresses for taking on non-standard roles and performing them with renewed energy, as much as it is a nod to the writers who are creating the characters. Diverting myself back to the film on hand, a montage of the lead characters at the beginning smoothly transforms into a flow that is rare in Hindi films. Even when the second half hits bumps, the narrative doesn't lose fluidity. A lot of the continuity can be attributed to the charming world of Bombay in the 60s. You cannot miss the music. It is lyrical violence. It is poetic noir. Yet, many a time it felt that what the writers might have thought of as “cool” didn't quite work out. However, there were a few scenes that worked really well given their context and the word that popped while watching the film was “unique”.It is a shame then, that while there were these unique bits, they were in bits and pieces. Some parts of the rest of it felt like tributes. Other parts seemed like they wanted to resemble a Hindi film from that era. Especially, the convoluted situations in the last hour or so of the film. In fact, the film seem to have been lengthened to stay in line with films from that time.Bombay Velvet also attempts political commentary. The partition, the politics behind the partition were the more obvious ones. But the more striking one was the inception of corruption in the country. This is when it all began – the woes that are so deep-rooted in the system now. I left the theater with a question. I enjoyed the film while watching it, found it slightly long but it didn't test patience at point. I liked the characters, the dialogue, the flow of the narrative, the plot till it gets carried away much like the lead character, Balraj. But, the film doesn't leave a mark that will remind you of what you felt while watching the film, like most good films do, certainly like all Anurag Kashyap films. It doesn't stay with you. My question then is, is it necessary that a film should aspire for more? Should it want to stay with the audience for a while later? Isn't it good enough that you were entertained for those 2-3 hours? For now, I will go with no. I want my films to be more like Balraj – ambitious.  *Yes, I was reminded of George R R Martin, writer of the book/TV show, Game of Thrones too.

A senseless comedy with no thought put into any department. Only this time its Kukunoor trying to do a Priyadarshan and failing miserably. Now, how sad is that!?","...actually it is. It attempts to be a comedy but succeeds at not making you laugh even once. It is a same-same romantic story but is different because it doesn't make you go ""aaaaawww"" once. It is also different from other Nagesh Kukunoor products. While Hyderabad Blues was just about average and Iqbal was a regular story presented well. Teen Deewarein and Dor(though copies) were certainly worth writing home about. Bombay to Bangkok however is one of those you feel ashamed about...let alone because you made it, you wouldn't want people to know you have watched it. How amateurish is it to have a 25-30 year old song play every time a certain character comes on screen!? So not funny, and such a sad way to romanticize anything. To add to the mayhem, voiceovers are used to avoid actual narration and shabby dream sequences appear to annoy. Making a brainless flick is an art. An art that is not easy to master. Even if you accept sexual references, toilet jokes, stereotyping, etc. as indispensable part of slapstick, you need something extra to keep them together. The movie has to have a driving force. Watching Bombay to Bangkok made me feel as if everyone is just going through the motions, no one is really interested. The cameraman just seemed to pick a few angles and the director played ""eeny-meeny-miney-moe"" to decide on the final shot. The editor seems to have been chopping stuff in his sleep. Only that can explain why some shots never seem to end and others are way too abrupt. The background music is pretty random too. Waltz replaced by some jingle-like tune for no rhyme or reason. Like everything else the script too is not completely thought out either. After an east meets far-east basic concept, the rest seems to be just written sporadically - while thinking of a thousand other things. The screenplay like its character is just running from one situation to another without any connection in between. An aimless, listless approach.Having said that, the cast does all it can to rise above all the flaws and does whatever best it can, given the constraints of a mediocre team. What bothers me most is that Nagesh Kukunoor, arguably one of the better film-makers in the industry, has shown such a thoughtless attitude to film-making. It is truly disheartening to see him struggle and fail miserably in trying to fit into the mainstream.

By they way, did anyone even consider real dialogues versus what the actors seem to have come up with from their own stand-up acts? How I longed for a single song - however bad, however inappropriately placed! Especially if it would have meant taking some screen time from the 15-minute-long people-hiding-in-closets-sequence and another 15-minute passing-the-treasure-game. We would be fools to expect a story when it took them 45 minutes to just introduce the dozen and a half ""characters"". Vijay Raaz was the only actor who made an attempt at a performance. The rest were just basking in their own glory of over-acting, oblivious to the world who wanted their ears, their hair, their brains intact. Of late, in general, even an overall bad movie has good camerawork, editing, sound design. Not here! Close-ups are so close that at least one character has his face chopped off - lower-lip and downward. I noticed at least two cuts mid-sentence when Raju Srivastav was speaking to the camera for some reason or the other. The characters were yelling at the top of their voices for me to be able to even notice the other noises.Don't worry guys, I realize I haven't been absolutely selfless here. I watched the movie because I have to. I told the world that I watched it because I wanted the award. I wrote this review in such length because one needs an outlet for one's frustration.

Maybe it'd make an interesting story, if it dealt with just that. Unfortunately, Boss starts out with this simple what if and complicates things beyond comprehension. To make matters manifold worse, this Robin Hood, Satya (Akshay Kumar) spouts inane dialogue to look cool; laughs at his own poor jokes; literally sings his own praises (just in case you hadn't guessed from the his finger rings); and is generally way too full of himself. The only saving grace is that he doesn't have a lead lady as a show piece. I guess, we could take offense that the makers of the film didn't even bother to have a role for a lead lady at all. But then if it were going to be as skimpily written as it was for Ankita (Aditi Rao Hydari), I guess it worked out best that there isn't a lead lady. Especially, given that Sonakshi Sinha's cameo had more recall value than Aditi's entire role. And I wouldn't blame Aditi's performance for it. The writing department just doesn't care enough to be taken seriously. With the numerous complications added to fill in the story, the writing completely loses track from where it starts. For example, Satya and Shiv's maternal uncle (Johny Lever) suddenly behaves like a stranger in a scene in the second half of the film. With such glaring mistakes, attention to detail is just way too much to ask for.Only aim here seems to be to give Akshay Kumar screen time. Interestingly enough, Akshay Kumar shows on screen 30 minutes into the film. I wonder what the reasons might have been. But, once he comes, he does his typical hamming and stays.Till then and for little snippets after Shiv Pandit does try his best to make an impact. But, it is Ronit Roy who stays in memory. He does have the fierceness that a villain pitted against a boisterous Satya/Akshay Kumar needs. Yet, his role is too ill-defined and unidimensional for it to instill fear. Sure, there are a couple of scenes which make you laugh out loud - more because it is silly beyond words than because it is witty. Also, the first one or two action sequences for Ronit Roy are brash enough to make you notice. Otherwise though, there are out-of-place film references, worse placed songs and over-the-top dialogues in the name of entertainment. I really wonder how one doesn't get bored doing the same kinds of role one after the other. Maybe they are different roles but are just performed in the same old way.

99,197,197,197,197,[The] Bourne Ultimatum,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma reviewNotepad1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/the-bourne-ultimatum-review/,,5/5.0,,2.866666667,,"After the considerable success of The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, it’s time for the third film in the series - The Bourne Ultimatum. Thankfully, it’s arguably the best so far.Where Ultimatum really comes into its own is the sheer pace at which the story unfolds. Director Paul Greengrass maintains an extremely high tempo throughout the movie. As Bourne attempts to keep one step ahead of his pursuers, Greengrass employs generous helpings of handheld camera shots and ultra-quick cuts to keep up the breathless ride. Every now and again, he’ll give the audience a few minutes’ respite, before revving up again.And Bourne certainly gets around. Even as the plot races through Moscow, Paris, London, Madrid, Tangiers and New York, each city is given room to shine. The Waterloo Station and Tangiers scenes are particularly memorable. Damon plays it straight down the middle. There are no cheesy one-liners here. There’s a strong supporting cast, with solid turns from David Strathairn as his CIA nemesis Noah Vosen, Joan Allen as a more sympathetic CIA director, Paddy Constantine as a British journalist and Albert Finney as the scientist mastermind behind the Treadstone programme. Of course, comparisons with the James Bond series are inevitable. In fact, the Bourne and Bond franchises have more differences than similarities, although it’s interesting to see how the latest Bond film – Casino Royale – cuts back on the gadgets ‘n’ girls formula and has a more Bourne-like, gritty feel. Perhaps they’re inspiring each other – certainly a couple of scenes (a rooftop chase and bathroom hand-to-hand scrap) crop up in both Casino Royale and Ultimatum.Greengrass keeps the violence focussed. This is no gore-fest. The bodycount is surprisingly low for a movie of this type and there’s little blood to be seen. Which is not to say the fights aren’t brutal: Bourne often gets stuck in and works hand-to-hand, with the camera so close it’s often difficult to see what’s going on. The quick cuts are deliberately disorientating – but not annoyingly so.The film serves up some interesting issues. Who is the real enemy? Where are the safeguards against an unaccountable government? In a ‘war against terror’, do the ends justify the means?Other movies have touched on similar themes. But what seemed fantastical in 1998’s Enemy of the State now seems worryingly more plausible in the post 9/11 era. Particularly, one scene in Ultimatum has eerie parallels with the July 2005 police shooting of a Brazilian electrician at a London underground station, in what turned out to be a calamitous case of mistaken identity.Of course, with any action thriller you have to suspend your disbelief. Fortunately for the screenwriters – and the audience – the frenetic direction doesn’t leave much time to pick holes in the plot, although one does wonder at Bourne’s miraculous ability to find unbarred windows to leap through in even the most maximum-security installations. Clearly, neither Bourne nor his CIA pursuers seem to believe in the adage ‘look before you leap’.And despite producing dispassionate and unemotional operatives via the Treadstone project, the CIA clearly hasn’t kept that philosophy for senior management. Straitham’s Vosen, in particular, takes every opportunity to make snap decisions in times of crisis rather than first considering his options. Sin in haste, repent at leisure. He doesn’t learn.By his nature, Bourne is a loner. There’s no romance in the movie, though fellow CIA employee Nicky Parsons (played by Julia Stiles) pops up to give Bourne someone else to look after. Refreshingly, the character of Pamela Landy (played by Joan Allen) gives one female a strong role at least.The soundtrack is functional and unobtrusive, helping pitch the mood without being overly noticeable. And that’s the way it should be – there’s enough going on already without additional distractions.For a Hollywood blockbuster, Ultimatum is sharp, fast-paced and tight. If you do go and see it, pay attention and enjoy the ride.

Unfortunately though, the story is pretty much static and has no support whatsoever from the dialogues.","Half an hour into the movie, I was amazed at how well I knew the dozen-odd characters. This was achieved by characters saying and doing things in a small sub-plot. Pretty impressive, that they didn't go the mundane voiceover route. Unfortunately though, most of the characters continue doing the same thing for the next hour and a half too. Movies like this exist neither to shock nor entertain nor thrill nor to provide relief from the daily grind. They are made just because someone thought more people should hear this story.  Almost all the characters are gray and they exist just for you to know them - not for you to judge or feel for. Since the going was slow, I had a lot of time to pay attention to things other than the ""object"" of the camera, and what he/she is saying/doing. Especially, since they did not have anything new to say/do after a while. The background stood out. The narrative is set up in a crowded set of buildings - Bow Barracks. There is constant but changing noise (children playing, people cooking, etc) in the background which adds flavor to the scene. The messy rooms reflected the personalities of the occupants. Though it does raise a question in my organization-crazy mind - did none of them really care for any sort of orderliness?! Oh well...I also enjoyed the picturization of the songs. The style was similar in all songs - shots of the singer singing, interspersed with the happenings at Bow Barracks. It was engaging, nevertheless, mainly because the singer was different every time and brought his/her style and nuances to the screen. The camera purposefully moves, in a style different from the way the rest of the movie is picturized, to give it the slightest video album touch. Unfortunately, the screenplay and the dialogues make this a drag to watch. Thirty minutes shorter and the movie would improve on both counts, because inevitably all the repetitive lines would have to see the door. So, if you are the kind for whom something needs to happen every minute, and the movie has to have an absolute definable purpose - please don't bother. But for those of you, who can ignore the flaws and focus on the characters - wait for the movie to be out on DVD and rent it when you are in a not-so-light mood. Parental warning! Loads of profanity and sexual content. Moderate violence.

101,199,199,199,199,Brave,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/brave-review/,,,,2.033333333,"Story-telling has always been Pixar’s strong point. They gripped you with fresh stories and extremely memorable and relatable characters in films like Toy Story and Wall-E. Brave, however, feels a bit formulaic and halfway through the film you feel you’re walking on familiar territory. Although, the use of a female protagonist is a first for Pixar, the film’s story and structure are banal and uninteresting. ","This has been a year of a large number of progressive, yet forgettable films. Starting with Mirror Mirror and Snow White and The Hunstmen, both of which are bolder adaptations of the age-old Snow White fairytale. The focus has been on subverting the largely patriarchal undertones that fairy tales impart with. Pixar’s newest film Brave immediately caught everyone’s attention with its trailers, involving a gallant, motor-mouth girl protagonist (for the first time in 17 years) with archery ambitions. Princess Merida (the protagonist) is feisty, but Brave is predictable, preachy and yes, forgettable.Brave tells the story of Merida (voice of Kelly Macdonald), who feels stifled by her mother’s conditioned upbringing. Her mother (Emma Thompson) tries her best to raise Merida like a lady, but Merida’s interests lie in horse-back riding, archery and adrenalin-pumping activities. It all comes crumbling down for her when she is summoned to wed her father’s fellow clan chief’s son. Fundamentally, the fact that a young girl is used as a protagonist is charming – you have a Hunger Games – Katniss Evergreen hangover but soon the predictable story-line takes over and pours water all over your expectations. There is humour in many of the beginning scenes, between her father King Fergus and her mother (typical husband-wife banter over the child). The Scottish countryside is beautifully animated, with its myriad of colors and depth in landscape – and it’s a relief to have a different geographical region being portrayed in the film. My biggest issue with Brave though is the fact that no other character is even remotely as memorable as Merida. Merida herself stands out visually, because of her hair and her Scottish accent. The witch could have been much more menacing, more in the lines of Cruella DeVille (101 Dalmations) or Ursula (The Little Mermaid). A memorable villain always makes the pursuit of the protagonist double-fold, and therefore, coupled with predictably paced action scenes, the film becomes monotonous towards the latter half. Brave had immense potential – the protagonist Merida is visually memorable and relatable. She’s the kind of character who if treated well, could have a roaring fan following among children. Coupled with an original story-line, a menacing villain and a certain universal quality that so much of Pixar’s earlier films have, it could have been a charming film. As it is, however, Brave is a letdown.

You've seen the promos, you've seen the film. The few insights either get lost in the rambling or become redundant with every recurrence. Just like real life. But, of course, the film is far, far from it. So, watch if you've nothing better to do, haven't fought with the partner in a while and are missing the banter.","Break Ke Baad the is title inviting. For reviewers to poke fun at. But we shall refrain. Make that try to refrain. Neither before interval not after is there a high point in the film. The conflict comes in the promos and stays there until the zzzzz climax. Like Abhay (Imran Khan) and Aaliya's (Deepika Padukone) on and off relationship, moments come and go. But nothing lingers, except for a looming sense of boredom.With focus on just two characters, you'd hope, the film would take us to a level that we know exactly how they are going to behave. The problem though is that we know our writers much better. We know, they like Abhay, will never take risks. Actually, half-way through the film, you know there's only disappointment written for you in the end. If everyone lives happily ever after, you are going to yawn. If they choose otherwise, you are going to be ridiculing the pointlessness of the film. The writers brought a no-win situation upon themselves. Way too many times a beautiful thought is ruthlessly murdered by making it verbose. A film that aims at relating to the youngsters has to have something more interesting than their own fights, no? You understand the pain but don't get what the big deal is! A girl and a boy love each other. And like all girls and boys who are in love, they bicker until they get on our nerves. One is clingy, the other wants space. They are used to each other, so they ricochet between staying together and apart. Every once in a while they say something remarkably insightful about each other. Like two people who actually know each other. Our life on screen. In fact, they add a zest, they don’t take their fights too seriously. Good.Only all this happens in the first half hour and repeats some 3-4 times till the end. Yet, you don't sense the claustrophobia both of them are going through. And ultimately, the characters behave like characters in a film and not like normal human beings. From being cool with their differences and conflict, suddenly these kids go on a break and are back or not or not. Bad. Very bad.When a film chooses to mimic life and its relationships, you expect a certain warmth, which is completely missing. It's not that the actors are not doing a good job. Deepika Padukone's straight back has always made her not-so-human for me. But, the director chooses a lot of close-up shots for her and she uses them well too. The irritation, the confusion, the straightforwardness comes through.  Imran Khan wears a lot of make-up. He looks like a school boy. His character is a little on the feminine side. That's cool and he passes off as the guy who who's love struck too. But it's all very ordinary. They still don't make the characters believable.Also, I'd much rather not see Sharmila Tagore and Navin Nischol, than see them in such shoddily written characters with some of the silliest lines. There are a couple of side characters who were interesting, but the writers didn’t have time from converting dialogues into long, mundane monologues, to delve into them. I appreciate the subtlety in Nadia's (Shahana Goswami) relationship with both Abhay and Aaliya but it looked like the editing took a whole lot of her out of the film.Equally wasted is some awesome music. The songs come and go in the background without registering much visually. Only saving grace is that the picturisation don't kill the songs either, even if they don't add to them. I'm still going to buy the album. Actually, the title Break Ke Baad is a sham. Because no one has ventured into what a person goes through when he/she has broken up. Whether they have broken up or the other person has, it's still hurtful and that pain comes across only once or twice in the film. And, even then, it doesn't cut through you. Baah! What a romanticized world I live in. I'm expecting romantic films to touch me.

This film however has a far simpler plot though - of a chance meeting between a married woman and a doctor, which turns into a full blown love affair. Highly recommended for its Billy Wilder-ish narrative, and Celia Johnson’s performance. Winner of the Grand Prize at Cannes, and nominated for Best Actress, Director and Screenplay at the Oscars.","Know that feeling when you’re about to bid farewell to someone? You’ve got the flow sorted in your head - you will probably hug, look into each other’s eyes, maybe even kiss, make promises that you will call, upload pictures.... and then suddenly someone - maybe a common friend - pops on the scene and spoils the moment, spoils the entire plan that you had in your head.  That’s the beginning of David Lean’s Brief Encounter.Lovers Laura (Celia Johnson) and Dr. Alec (Trevor Howard) are about to bid farewell to each other, for good. And the moment is spoiled by a rather chatty and intrusive Dolly (Everley Gregg), familiar to Laura. It’s tragic and when all Alec is able to do is gentle press Laura’s shoulder to offer her comfort, your heart reaches out to them.You however realise the complete nuisance and magnitude of Dolly’s intrusion only by the end of the film. By that time, you’ve seen Laura retreating into a shell of her thoughts, sitting in front of her husband, imagining the brief affair with Alec and narrating an imaginary confession of sorts, detailing how they met, where they went, what they did and how she felt through all this.An extra-marital affair, borne out of a stable, happy marriage is a bad thing. But here’s where Laura still managed to win sympathy - the honesty with which she explains her predicament, is touching. You realise that before she could know the social impossibility of her affair, Laura and Alec have fallen in love out of pure innocence. What I found even more convincing was the manner in which they fall in love - no stunts, no songs, just a few cups of tea, hanging out together and a rather engaging conversation after, Laura finds herself absorbed in his eyes.A big question popped up in my head though - and it’s a trick which women in cinema have fallen for (reminded me of Billy Wilder’s The Apartment especially). When you and a woman you know are coincidentally going for the same show for a movie, is she ever going to be impolite and say, ‘I’m alone, I’ve got a balcony seat, and I hope we’re not sitting together.’? Her politeness on the contrary is where she gives in and the man takes the bait and the rest is history. Something similar happens in Brief Encounter. Laughing together looking in the same direction, can produce some strange signals between a man and woman.I’m a big fan of using restraint in films. In Brief Encounter, I liked the way David Lean never made the two lovers go over the top - their romance is a subtle, restrained and completely self-aware of it’s wrong-doing (a momentary kiss is halted by shadows of people). If this film was re-made today, it would break all forms of explicitness.An interesting parallel I observed was that between Laura’s family life and her meeting Alec. The first time she goes out with Alec, she returns home to find her son unwell. It’s a gentle sign, but worthy enough to indicate disapproval of the scheme of things. My favourite metaphor in the film was how Noel Coward’s screenplay begins Laura and Alec’s relationship - minutes before they bump into each other, Laura is troubled by a speck of dust in her eye. The Hindi phrase ‘aankhon mein dhool jhonkhna’ being used as a symbol to start an illegit affair - nice touch, Mr Coward!At 86 minutes, Brief Encounter lives up to its title. It’s an engaging watch, filled with great lines, classic romantic moments and a performance by Celia Johnson that’s worthy of the Oscar nomination she received.

A few smooth yet powerful action moves. That's it. Then, the only words that linger are  - long, slow and futile. ","Within the first ten minutes you begin to wonder why a supposedly action film is going so, so slow. I am all for lingering lenses that allow you to take in the atmosphere, but nothing of that sort here. Except for some fast moving action choreography and editing, the rest of the movie is a drag which doesn't even lead any where.The scene stays because the director is under the impression that unless he italicises, underlines, and emboldens every thing he wants to say we won't get it. For instance, just in case you didn't get that the finger ring a character is putting on is a happy memory or not, you have background music to confirm it for you. And this is only the beginning. This pretty much carries on for the rest of the film, though the pace picks up every so slightly in post-interval. This too is an illusion though. The story is still moving at snail pace towards the mother of all predictable climax sequences. But, at least there is action and the editing of the action scenes take charge.  There are a couple slick fights in the ring and a few moves that make you cringe and drop your jaw at the same time. One of them though suddenly moves a long shot making you wonder if it is to mask the fact that a stunt double was used.Otherwise thought, both Siddharth Malhotra and Akshay Kumar are more or less restrained. Especially, when set against the loud background and dramatic camera movements. Jackie Shroff, on the other hand, gets annoying with his over-the-top drunkenness and attempt at sobriety. His ands though have given an ace performance (unless he had a “hands” double!). You are delighted to see Shefali Chhaya, but hshe looks like she wants to match Jackie Shroff in his overacting – line to line. Jackqueline Fernandes plays her usual prop self and Kareena Kapoor is worse than that. The moment I see a randomly placed item number, I read that as the writer/director telling me, “I don't have faith in my narrative/narration. So here you go, I think you will like this.” The other songs are plain soporific - excuses for montages to be used as moving the plot ahead. In my mind - lazy writing. There is decent scope for an internal struggle for each of the characters. Interestingly, each member of the Fernandes family has their own little island of sorrow. Each one is struggling between what they want to do and what they should do. Unfortunately, this is you reading a little too much in their situations, trying to get involved. Else, the movie is happy just telling you, “he is the underdog”, “he is the villain”, “he is the monster”. There is zero attempt at trying to let you discover that through their actions. I agree, films like Brothers need a certain amount of drama to accentuate the action. Such action to make sense in a film need an emotional hook too; else it will feel like you are watching a game on TV. But, this combination didn't work here. All you can recommend it for is the fight sequences when the film is on TV.

Family, friendship and love (in that order) are the elements of this teen-capers flick.","I couldn't review Bubble Gum because it didn’t release in Pune. And such a shame that is, for my guest reviewer IdeaSmith loved it and has some really good things to say about it. Here's hoping you can catch it. - meetuWhen the promos for Bubble Gum first flashed on my TV screen, I changed the channel. I figured that the title was a description of the superficial lives of over privileged kids who date at 12, have their own cars at 14 and a passport stamped with all the fashionable destinations, by the time they are 16. Indeed, if Meetu hadn’t asked me to do a guest-review, this movie might have passed from my notice. The loss would have been entirely mine.The promos and posters tell you that this is a story of puppy love and teenage friendships. I’m almost loath to say any more since it would go counter to reviewing without giving the movie away (Oh Meetu, this is so hard!). Let me start by saying that my perceptions were entirely wrong. This is not bubblegum of the fancy ‘Oh, I lurrrrve San Francisco, I got this tee-shirt at Disneyland on my last visit’ crowd. It’s the bubblegum of the local-brand-chews-like-eraser variety that anyone who grew up in India of the 80s would remember. The story is set in a time before mobile phones, satellite television and neighborhood coffee bars. Bubble Gum starts with this simple introduction and explains how at that time, the most one could expect from love was a stolen glimpse of the beloved or a surreptitious hand clasp during kabaddi.Bubble Gum explores the world of 14-year-old, Vedant in Jamshedpur in the days drawing up to Holi. A grown-up Vedant (who is never shown) narrates the tale, giving it a very 'The Wonder Years’ feel. The movie touches on every aspect of the boy’s life so artfully that anyone who is or has ever been fourteen will feel a sense of kinship. Vedant chafes under parental authority, has an ongoing war with his arch rival Ratan, sighs deeply over the pretty girl next door and is frequently bailed out of scrapes by his brother, Vidur. So what makes this teenager, this story special? For starters, it is the first Hindi movie in recent times, about this age group. It’s not a cutesy monsters-and-noises tale for a primary school child. Nor does it have the teeny-bopper flavour of a number of other recent releases, which target either older teenagers or ‘the cool set’, focusing exclusively on puppy love. Infatuation is only one of the things that concern a preteen/early teenager and it is accorded the same status in Bubble Gum. Peer pressure, sibling jealousy and detachment from the parental unit are also major aspects of a young adult’s life and Bubble Gumexplores each of these without ever turning preachy or predictable.Secondly, every character, even a minor one, is etched in the kind of detail that makes a story truly delightful. You watch most of the movie through Vedant’s eyes but you also recognize his parents’ dilemma and his brother’s blind protectiveness. You even feel certain camaraderie with the roguish, rough-and-ready Ratan. Even characters who only appear in a couple of scenes add to the funny nostalgia value as they make the audience think of someone just like that from their own lives - the rakhi sister who is a go-between for the lovers, the pushy Bengali mother combing her hair on the balcony, ready to take up cudgels on her Partho’s behalf, the gulal-seller who moonlights as a goon, the baby brother who must and can be bribed with chocolate, to play messenger.One of the major aspects of this movie has not been detailed in the promos and in keeping with the theme of this blog, I won’t mention it either. You’ll know it when you see it, in the first five minutes of the film. All I’ll say is that it’s been done only a few times in Bollywood and never quite as well as this.As it turns out, Bubble Gumis only being screened at a select few theatres. Of the multiplexes, PVR Cinemas is the only one in Mumbai that I could find with a show and even then, only a single one per theatre in the morning. There must have been a special screening for schools since there were two groups of children present with their teachers in tow in the audience. You would think that a theatre full of preteen kids would make for a raucous audience. But the movie kept us all glued to our seats, with only an occasional cheer or laugh at Vedant’s adventures.I thought Bubble Gum would be the perfect group outing movie for a bunch of preteens. My mother who accompanied me to the film, thought it would be an interesting watch for parents of teenagers. And though neither of us is a part of those two groups, we each still immensely enjoyed the film.

The ones in the middle need to wake up from idle idealistic conversations and find a solution. Any movie in this genre has to offer a solution of its own. And that solution is invariably one that has the same pitfalls as many others. Buddha In A Traffic Jam is no different. Strong words, strong opinions it might use, but the result is pretty much the same.The ones in power are afraid to give away control; the self-appointed saviors believe that their opinion is the last word, their solution is the only one and that they are right in wanting the suppressed to live their lives in only that one way. Buddha In A Traffic Jam intends to show a path that gives the power back to the common man, but without thinking it through. Of course, no one expects a film to come up with foolproof solutions to problems that have lasted decades. But, if you want me to believe a business proposal that has no middlemen from producer to end-user, you have to give me some context of how you are going to go about it without transportation, warehousing, government taxes and so on. Also, the movie is setup such that it starts of with random exposure to the two Indias. Then it suddenly feels like they realised they are rambling and need to get a story in order. So, a story is thrown in. But, by then it is too late. Each character or group thereof seems to represent a real life part of the population and then a story of one person is jolted in only to go back to the representation mode of characterisation.Sure, the ideas thrown around are interesting but there is something very superficial about the proposed implementation. Also, some aspects seem to have entered the scene to shock or just to lengthen the film. At a little less than 2 hours, the film shouldn't have felt long, but it does. A lot of it is because it comes across as propoganda rather than an attempt at making a good film. Even so it is different from the norm. It has decided on making a point and does its best. It has its share of good performances. Arunoday Singh for example is brilliant and finally shows that he can act. His accent does come in the way, but it passes. Anupam Kher, Pallavi Joshi, Mahie Gill are all in good form too. They are all given their share of heavy-handed dialogue and they deliver those as they are meant to be – with reassured enthusiasm and conviction. However, by focusing on strong dialogue, the writers have done nothing new in terms of the story. In some ways, Buddha In A Traffic Jam reminded me of Hazaron Khwaishein Aisi - the lead cast's name, the music, of course the disillusion of a revolution and some more. Yes, there are 2 Indias. One is ignorant and thus oppressed. The other is educated, hopefully intelligent and thus happily inconsiderate. Both these sections are exploited by the ones in power – the politicians, the businessmen. The  difference is the former is quiet and submissive while the latter is agitated but chooses to shrug it off. In some sense, the latter has a little more power to do something about their own situation and that of the ones in the interiors, untouched part of the country. At its best, I can think of Buddha In a Traffic Jam as throwing around one idea as a solution while asking for yours.

109,207,207,207,207,Buried,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/buried-review/,,5/5.0,,3.1,"Ryan Renolds’ in Buried is buried in a box. He’s trapped. There’s very little oxygen, and very little space. The light flickers through the film, and it makes you feel uneasy. Having this premise, somewhere in the middle I was convinced at some point the film would get boring, but it keeps you hooked mostly because Reynolds’ makes you feel his frustration down to last minute. ","What would you do if you got stuck in a box? And no, I am not trying to revive the melo-dramatic scene from Guzaarish, where Hrithik Roshan tries to explain to someone the metaphorical sense of being helpless. This is about literally being stuck in a box where you just about fit. It’s dark, cold, dirty and you have no idea how you ended up there. Ryan Reynolds in Buried spends 95 mins in a box – buried alive and trying desperately to figure out a way to get out.Be warned, this is not a film meant for the claustrophobic. I started watching the movie with my fan switched off and with a light sweatshirt. When I was done, I was so tense, my room felt like an oven even with the fan on. My bed felt too small and I had to compulsively walk around to remind myself that there was space around me. And I’m not even claustrophobic. Ryan Renolds as Paul Conroy plays a truck driver based in Iraq who wakes up buried in a coffin. How he ends up in this coffin, he’s unaware. All he remembers is being hit in the head, and waking up in pitch darkness in a box just as big as his dimensions. The first 5 mins of the film are dark. You can’t see anything; you can only hear heavy breathing and uncontrollable fidgeting. More than once, I fought the urge to forward the film to a point where I could see something. Even after Reynolds brings some light in with a zippo lighter, it’s flickering and troubled. You’re so frustrated by now you just feel like pulling him out of the screen and bringing him into your room! We learn the box has been equipped with a phone so that the kidnappers can make contact with him and demand a ransom. This disturbing introduction is followed by frantic calls to his loved ones, the FBI, 911 in America – all of whom make him hold, take their own time to comprehend his situation. The more frustrated you get, the more Buried pulls your strings. Just when you are hopeful he might find his way out, something goes wrong. The sense of fear has been interpreted superbly by director Rodrigo Cortes and writer Chris Sparling. How much can one work around the idea of a man stuck in a box, anyway?You never once feel the sense of being stuck, ironically. Buried allows you to keep hoping whatever Conroy is planning will work out. You go through the drill of being spooked out, but even as he speaks with various people on the phone, kicks, screams and cries, something always keeps you hopeful that he will get out – it’s a gripping series of events. Not much innovation could be brought into the photography and yet the lighting is minimalistic but effective. The extreme close-ups of half an eye and a stubble-beard give the exact sense of the lack of space in the frame. Ryan Reynolds plays his part as a helpless person caught in a messy political situation. Why him, we ask? How is he relevant and what will anybody gain by burying an insignificant truck driver? It’s these questions that manage to fuel your frustration as a viewer. What I love the most about Buried is that no back story is offered – it’s plain and simple. Paul Conroy needs to escape, and how he tries to, makes for the film. The features on the Blu-ray are rather brief but informative. We learn the film used 7 coffins to shoot, where coffins had one side opened. Director Rodrigo Cortes mentions the filming was difficult but was shot in 17 days. There are no deleted scenes, or a commentary on the filming process but the interview with the director pretty much gives you insight into the making.As an afterthought, Buried could have been crisper. It does tend to get repetitive in some bits, what with melodramatic reactions on Renolds’ part. But for sheer courage to make a film like this is 17 days and to be able to spook a viewer to an extent that fast-forwarding becomes an option, Buried is a must-watch. However, please remember to catch your breath every now and then.

Pankaj Kapoor gives yet another excellent performance.","Very rarely in Hindi cinema can you say - no significant story, not everybody has acted well, but still go watch it. Every frame (well almost!) is enchanting. And the going is slow, so you have enough time to take in every detail. Yes, the movie is a fairy tale and is narrated as such. Melodrama is used where a parent would use exaggerated voice modulation to narrate the story. But, I still wouldn't call it a children's movie. It is very unlikely that the hues, the pace, or the subtle sense of humor are going to retain a child's attention. On the other hand, it is a very short movie and what a perfect way this would be to introduce the art that cinema is to children! And yes parents, there is a moral at the end of the story.The camerawork, both indoors and outdoors, is simply breathtaking. Himachal Pradesh's tourism department could very well use scenes from here to advertise its scenic beauty. Though the interiors are largely shot in the dark, the lighting and colors are used to beautify the scenes to perfection. A few scenes are shot from the point of view of a character or an object, allowing you to see what they/it are seeing - here the camera in combination with the background score has been used to enhance the emotion sought to be created (read more in the ""what worked"" section).  There were a few frames that were outright ugly, almost felt like they were shot by a different camera crew altogether. But, after a while, I noticed that such shots were used specifically for the darker characters. Maybe it wasn't intentional, but if the viewer feels obligated to rationalize the things they don't like, the director has done his job well, right?The simple story is complemented by simple music which is soft on the ears. The lyrics very appropriately followed a child's train of thoughts. Reminded me a lot of Gulzar's own 'lakdi ki kaathi' from Masoom - a song that I grew up listening to. The lyrics especially stood out when the umbrella, an inanimate object, was being spoken of as a lover.What stuck out as a sore thumb was the acting by all the side characters. In fact, the little girl's performance was also not up to mark. It was lifeless and flat. Pankaj Kapoor however, made up for all of it with brilliant body language. And this movie is more about the artistic representation of the subject, more than any individual performance. Though, the movie is about the characters, it is not a character driven script. Here I go rationalizing again!This movie is as much a trip to fantasy land as it is an experiment with the medium through creative use of camera, lighting, music and color. A work of art that is very rarely made available to the common movie-going population. So, catch it while it is still in the theaters, because a DVD might not do full justice to the overall effort.

Only, that they try doing it with slapstick and murder the idea.","I take great pains to avoid the family sagas on TV and so am offended when all of it is thrust down my throat by Ekta Kapoor herself. Even if it is taking non-stop digs at her own production house along with a few at realty shows. This is Ekta taking undue advantage of being the producer of this film. Was she by any chance trying to justify the bad quality of her story lines?On the other hand, they’ve made quite a few others the butt of their imbecile sense of humor - Kaun Banega Crorepati, Karan Johar, Mahesh Bhatt, Akshay Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan’s status, Art of living, Jagjit Singh, Nach Baliye, J P Dutta, Doordarshan, and I’m sure many more. Only wish there were a laugh or two tucked in there somewhere.  Well, C Kkompany is not entirely heartless. Post-interval, it does come up with a cute idea to deal with the impotency of the administration to solve the citizens’ problems. However, it didn’t take it to the next possible step of having the government take up ownership. Instead, soon enough, it gets so shockingly similar to Lage Raho Munnabhai that judging from the tone of the movie it looks more like a dig at it. I’d have been convinced that that’s what it is, but for some decent performances by the lead trio.  Not that they make you laugh or smile even, just that they sort-of convince you that they care and are good people. Also, these three had actual differentiating personalities which is missing in most movies of this genre.Seeing Raima Sen in a meaningless role such as this, especially after Manorama - Six Feet Under, made me wonder whether the times are really so bad for good talent. How much life could her eyes and expressions induce in the lousy lines she’s given. On the other hand though, despite the derogatory status women are accorded, I liked the fact how regular, “not hot”, women were cast to play housewives. Songs are to this movie as commercial breaks are to TV programs. Which means its time to go fetch your popcorn, take a short walk to stretch your legs, or whatever it is you need to take a break for.  So, yet again, a concept with potential to entertain dies at the hands of slapstick. Oh well…

And yet, I enjoyed the movie thoroughly. Brilliant writing by Jaideep Sahni!!","I am the target audience for this movie. Like many Indians, (as appropriately depicted in the movie) I am a run-a-minute person. So, any game that claims to be ""exciting"" when the final score is 1-0, interests me only so much. Top it off with a ""Shah Rukh Khan is over-rated"" attitude. You know the makers have played their cards right, if a person with such tastes was hooked to the movie through its entire length. Though the credit mainly goes to the sharp and focused writing, the casting needs special mention too. But that will have to wait...This is Jaideep Sahni's movie all the way. The little unexpected things in the script make all the difference in an otherwise ordinary plot. In a movie about underdogs trying to achieve the impossible, you pretty much know where the story is going. It's the ""how"" you get there that counts and CHAKDE! INDIA scores (all pun intended!) at many levels. The obstacles that the characters encounter on the ride, and how they are overcome, keep you glued with enthusiasm till they reach their destination. And I am really glad they stuck to the hockey team and did not whine too much about the coach and his life.The rhythmic ups and downs in the story are supported equally well by the crisp, witty dialogues and the you-are-smart-viewers silences.  The sub-episodes flow from one into another without being episodic. That the editors did their job well is also demonstrated by this remark I overheard on my way out of the movie, ""The good thing about Hindi movies these days is that they are only two hours. 9.30 to 11.30 - nice movie"". The movie had actually started at 9. If a movie felt 20% shorter than it was, the editing department has done their job really well. Oh yeah, casting...the first thing you do to sell an ideology is to get a popular actor on board. But, they went one step further. The whole team is perfectly cast. From the hockey team to the hockey association members - not one of them can be singled out for not fitting into the shoes of the character.  It is difficult to say whether the dialogues were written first or the actors were chosen first. Okay - I loved Shah Rukh Khan's acting! There - I said it. Done.  (Believe me - It wasn't remotely as easy for me to write this as it is to read it.) The smirks were conspicuous by their absence; there was only an occasional, unnecessarily long-paused sentence; no romantic lines delivered in half-whispers (thank goodness!); and - get this - no trade-marked raising of hands on the side as if he is waiting for me to hug him. Best of all, he shared the space with the girls without overshadowing them. No-no, it's not only things that he did not do. There are things that he did right too. He was very controlled in emoting frustration, happiness, anger, disbelief. Actually all this made me excuse the occasional ""I am the King"" attitude (Ray Ban, et al)...ahem...okay...now before I get a divorce notice in the comment space here, let's wrap this up here.When the entire audience is rooting for a women's hockey team for 150 minutes straight, you know the movie has worked. The movie certainly achieved its aim of drawing attention to our national sport and especially to the plight of the women in this sport. It invoked the national spirit, made us whistle and cheer, clap hard, and laugh out loud. It was almost like we were in a stadium watching an actual game. The question, now, is - are we sensitized enough to do something about the situation? Meanwhile, like Shah Rukh's acting keep your expectations in control and enjoy the show.

","Madhur Bhandarkar must assume your eyes are shut tight for him to call his own films “eye-openers” or he is blind to things that must be going on in the industry to give us such a superficial view. Certainly things far worse must happen in the glam-world than his movies about it say. Having taken this into account, I watch his films as stories rather than revealing account of anything. But Calendar Girls doesn't have that either.It follows the lives of five girls who have supposedly made it big in the industry because they have posed in a leading calendar. In this age of digital calendars, I don't even know what that means and why that is important. Anyway, moving on, these girls expectedly struggle, make it, break, evolve or give up.  Though, there are five directions these lives take, only one of them is half-interesting. The good bit is that there is not too much drama around the story-telling. Everything is presented in a matter-of-fact tone and just that – a story of a model. But, unfortunately, the characters, their arcs, the lines, the way they say the lines are lacking too. It is, in fact, amusing the number of times twitter trend is mentioned, making the writers sound like they have discovered a new bird called twitter. And just in case you miss it, they explain what it is all about, which ends up exposing how underexposed the writers are themselves. Like that one person we all know in our lives, who shows off their wealth by mentioning their trip to Mauritius “in passing”.As smirk-worthy as that is, it is infuriating that the writers must believe they are making a film about women and how empowered they can be. Even if said in jest, “I make women-oriented films because male stars are less professional than women stars” is demeaning to women at so many levels. You give them the benefit of doubt. They must have meant it as a self-deprecating joke; but hey what is self-deprecating about making women-oriented films? They must have meant it as women are more professional; but hey is the comparison necessary and does that mean you'd rather make male-oriented films. Try as I might, there is no good way of making this sound good or even acceptable.Then the writers run out of occasions to mention twitter and selfie, and go back to tropes like celebrity being paid to attend a funeral. Sure, it is an amusing facet of that world and the associated farce makes you roll your eyes too. But, Mr. Bhandarkar, you didn't think we have forgotten the last time where we saw this, did you?It doesn't help that hardly any of the actresses can act. Ruhi Singh has a very distracting accent. Her dialogue delivery is actually like that of kids in school dramas. While Kyra Dutt and Akanksha Puri show glimpses of expressions, Avni Modi and Satarupa Pyne are what Madhur Bhandarkar's cameo says about a leading actress – single expression. However, who are we fooling by judging these ladies for their performances, right? They are clearly not here for any of that non-sense. I must say though, I am a little surprised that the sleaze wasn't as bad as I had expected and it was refreshing to see a Bhandarkar film without a stereotypical, gay fashion designer. Yet, it is always a mark against a film when you start talking about the things the film could've done wrong, but didn't.

115,213,213,213,213,[The] Call,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/call-review/,,,,2.95,"Brad ‘The Machinist’ Anderson’s latest film, The Call, is a fast-paced thriller that thrills only in bits, and ends quite weakly. The setting and characters of the film are interesting, but in trying too hard, Anderson ultimately fails in dishing out a gripping thriller. The Call is not unwatchable, but is also not even close to being a must-watch. ","How many times have we watched an American film, where a character dials 911 and cops come bursting through the door soon after? While scores of films have shown cops to be the heroes, often laying their lives for the sake of justice, very rarely has anyone ever a peeked into the lives of the people who actually answer that 911 call. On the surface, it seems like any other call centre – continuous calls, mostly silly, with a caller who is almost always unreasonably agitated. But then, on a lot of calls, also hinge matters of life and death. Anyone who can read, can fix your problem with your cellular operator or your toaster. But a 911 call can be a different story altogether.It is perhaps this aspect of Brad Anderson’s The Call that is most fascinating, because you get to realize the worth of anonymous heroes, who fade into oblivion after answering the call that probably saved lives. Starting off by humanizing these anonymous voices, then moving on to what is actually quite a taut thriller before ultimately descending into near-absurdity when it tries to move in for the kill, The Call is an uneven film that engages you often, but ends up leaving you quite disappointed as you walk out.Halle Berry plays Jordan, a seasoned 911 operator who is damn good at her job. One of her calls, however, doesn’t go quite as expected. Brad Anderson knows how to craft a thriller, that much you have to concede. And what he seems to enjoy a lot is lacing his thriller with just that slight tinge of a horror element. His 2004 film is almost seminal in this regard, frequently flitting the boundaries between thriller and horror with utmost ease. He tries something similar with The Call, though toning down the horror element quite a bit, making it very subtle and visceral. Full marks to him for trying, but the end result isn’t nearly as thrilling or horrifying as he had hoped. The big problem with the film lies in the last half hour of the film. The most important aspect of writing and directing a thriller is knowing when the thrill has reached a peak, and easing the audience off that peak with assuredness. The disadvantage that an out-and-out thriller has is that the audience invariably catches up, making it hard to leave them on a high, unlike other genres. Also, the very premise of the last half hour is absurd, because it goes against the fundamental concept that the film starts off with - the life of a 911 operator. Halle Berry, in a role that she can sleepwalk through, expectedly does a fair job. The rest of the cast pretty much has to stand by and watch her do her thing. Michael Eklund hams it up a bit as a psychopath, overdoing the crazy quite often. However, and this was quite a surprise, I quite liked how his character was written. The reason for him being the way he is, intrigued me quite a bit. His character has a gamut of emotions and layers to it, and is revealed only bit by bit, making it an unexpected facet in this genre of film. Very rarely does a film attempt this. But this eventually also adds to why the climax of the film doesn’t work; it also goes against the fundamental concept of his character. With its crisp 94-minute runtime and brisk pace, The Call often engages you, but it ultimately disappoints. It is never unwatchable, but it just never gets as compelling as it could have been, with the absurd climax being the final nail in the coffin.

116,214,214,214,214,Captain America: The Winter Soldier,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review3 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/captain-america-winter-soldier-review/,,5/5.0,,3.95,"The First Avenger is back, and this time he's saving the world from an enemy that lies within. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is good fun while it lasts, though it disappoints a bit as well, primarily in how it doesn't do justice to the intriguing villain of the title. Still, a good cast and some exciting moments make the film engaging enough.","It's hard to not have fun watching a film like Captain America: The Winter Soldier on a gigantic IMAX screen, which virtually transports you into the middle of the action. With a plot that attempts to be relevant - what with the current scenario of worldwide electronic espionage - and a neat little cast that has a few welcome additions to the previous film, it keeps you entertained for the most.Yet, as you ponder over it, despite the clear attempts to stand out, this sequel is really no different from the slew of superhero reboots and sequels that are a regular summer feature, now. Same old, same old.In Chris Evans' first turn as the First Avenger, we were served a relatively silent film - a film that set up the character well, and had a genuine attempt at a World War II period feel to it; at least as much as a big superhero film could muster. The sequel is set in the current day, and is bigger, grander and louder.Captain America, now settling in to the quantum leap the world has taken since he last remembered it, is sucked in to a conspiracy within S.H.I.E.L.D. itself, one that has global security ramifications. Meanwhile, he is also up against a mysterious villain, known only as the Winter Soldier, but who is tied intricately with Captain America's past.With a staple dose of humour, tons of action, and with a lot of talk along the way, the film pretends to be a bit of a heavyweight in terms of its plot, but comes across as a tad too superficial, eventually. While the twists are predictable, the action has been shot far better than the last film, with an unsteady look that obviously gives it an edgier feel. The 3D, however, doesn't particularly add much to the film.With Scarlett Johansson's Natasha (or Black Widow) and Marvel's latest big screen debutante Falcon (played quite well by Anthony Mackie) for company this time round, there's a whole lot of forgettable fun to be had while it lasts. Another addition to the cast, which lends the film so much more credibility than it eventually commands, is Robert Redford who plays the enigmatic Alexander Pierce.Samuel L. Jackson - who seems to be having quite some fun in his appearances as Nick Fury, Director, S.H.I.E.L.D. - gets a longish role as well, and one of the best moments of the film is the briefest of hat tips to his Jules Winnfield from Pulp Fiction. But that's probably just the Tarantino fanboy in me speaking. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo, known for far smaller films, usually lighter in vein, take on their biggest film to date, and they do a decent job with it. Though it lacks any truly jaw-dropping set pieces, the frames and scale are grand enough, while some are actually quite imaginative in execution; one car chase sequence is exhilarating, and the film has the extended action climax we've come to expect.The biggest problem with the film, for me, was the lack of justice to the eponymous villain, the Winter Soldier. His appearances are sporadic, his presence is never fully explained, and his history with Captain America is never given enough meat. There simply is no reason why his name is included in the title of the film, when the plot of the film has virtually nothing to do with him. He is relegated to a side attraction, at best.Expectedly, the end credits scene - directed by Joss Whedon - teases a little, with the introduction of couple of Marvel villains who are poised to add some spice in the future. In fact, it's time we admit that these standalone Avengers films are fast becoming just like teasing nuggets for Avengers: Age of Ultron. That, really, is the big prize we're waiting for, in lieu of the time we give the films along the way.

117,215,215,215,215,Captain Phillips,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/captain-phillips-review/,,,,3.95,"A thrilling film with terrific performances, Paul Greengrass's Tom Hanks-starrer Captain Phillips is a great DVD to own, because of some truly delightful bonus content.","He has done this before, Paul Greengrass; and I mean that in the nicest way. Greengrass has a penchant for taking stories based on true events - usually ones where we already know how they end - and he still manages to make gripping cinema out of them; the kind that fastens you to your seats.The pinnacle of this still remains United 93, which is personally one of my favourite films ever. Using that familiar handheld camera and a brown, gritty colour tone, his latest offering is Captain Phillips - a film based on the real life Richard Phillips, who was captain aboard an American container ship, which was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009.Grim and claustrophobic, because so much of the film is set in tight quarters in the middle of nowhere, the film is almost unrelenting in its thrill factor. And while many filmmakers choose the handheld route to tell their tale, Greengrass always manages to make things look like they're real and happening before your very eyes, oblivious of the fact that everything is, in fact, being staged for the camera.The confrontation scenes between the pirates, led by their leader Muse, and Captain Phillips are easily the highlight of the film. Watching the terrific Tom Hanks, in one of his career best performances (despite a strangely jarring accent), spar with young debutante Barkhad Abdi, who plays Muse, are a treat, because of just how convincing Hanks, in particular, is. Abdi is raw at times, but he mostly manages to match up to Hanks; a feat in itself.   The film, admittedly, makes for a better big screen watch, by sheer nature of it's subject. Thrills are obviously best experienced in darkened cinema halls. Yet, the DVD of Captain Phillips is so rich in content, that it actually makes the DVD a must-own for any true cinephile.The most important feature, of course, is the option of watching the entire film with a commentary by Paul Greengrass. There's nothing quite like having the director talk you through a film, to tell you just what it took to conceptualise or film a particular scene. He also narrates interesting snippets; like how Tom Hanks and the young men playing the Somali pirates hadn't ever met before filming their first meeting in the film. This was because Greengrass wanted to capture that unfamiliarity and nervous tension between them when they confront each other for the first time. Stuff like this truly adds value, when one wants to understand what a director's vision really entails.And if the director's commentary wasn't enough, then there is also an in-depth 55 minute featurette titled 'Capturing Captain Phillips', which is essentially the making of the film. Again rich in all that it took to make a tough production like this a reality, the featurette is another little gem that aids in understanding the finer nuances of the craft of film production.A single DVD packs in the film as well as the bonus features. The Captain Phillips DVD is one of those rare DVDs that one must buy more for the special features than for the film itself, even though the film is definitely worth a watch. United 93 is still my favourite Greengrass film, but with Captain Phillips, he surges ahead nonetheless.

118,216,216,216,216,Carnage,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/carnage-review/,,,,3.95,"Roman Polanski Carnage is a thoroughly enjoyable film set completely within the confines of a New York apartment. Witty, insightful writing and an exceptionally talented cast turn a perfectly normal social situation into something that might resemble what the title of the film implies. In attempting to solve a squabble between children, sometimes one can’t help feel that perhaps adults can be worse. Yes, there are Oscar winners in theatres currently, but this one isn’t half bad. ","Roman Polanski’s latest offering, Carnage, based on a play by Yasmina Reza, is a unique film. Unique, because unlike almost every other film that has ever been made, the entire film (apart from the opening and closing credits) plays out in real time. So, the 80 minutes that you spend in the cinema equals the 80 minutes that the stellar cast spend with each other in the film. What makes Carnage such a delight are the sharp dialogues, delivered finely that together will plaster a silly smirk on your face through the film, provided you pay attention.A perfectly innocuous (if a little violent) fight between two kids in a New York neighborhood is escalated to their parents. The parents being, well, ‘parents’, attempt to resolve the issue in a more ‘mature’ manner, trying to talk it out between themselves. So, the Longstreets, played by Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly call the Cowans (Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz) over to their home.Over coffee, cobbler and eventually, scotch, all facades are quite ungracefully pulled down as each couple’s relationship unravels at the seams, and each character’s quirks begin to surface in a rather ‘dramedic’ manner (if I may coin a word.)
What is marvelous is the way one rarely ever feels a sense of discontinuity in the proceedings. It is hard to believe that this film was shot as a ‘film’ and not as a continuous one-act play in a multi-cam setup. Perhaps the only thing that really gives it away visually is the changing colour of Kate Winslet’s lipstick. Over the course of the film, everything, from pseudo-political ideology to gender stereotypes, is discussed through the characters. What is interesting to note is how certain situations cause certain people to group together irrespective of how much they dislike each others’ personalities. Carnage is, in that sense, a perfect study of urban human behavior. The film is made so watchable because the actors are made to pump in credibility into their parts like few ever do. Jodie Foster is incredible as the seemingly mature aspiring writer with a soft corner for the sufferers of the atrocities in Darfur. Her character has a strange graph through the film, and though she goes from being the most level-headed to being the most hyperactive within seconds, she deserves full marks for making it look natural. Even in her level-headedness, one could easily make out what exactly was bubbling under the surface. John C. Reilly as her hardware store owner husband is perhaps the weakest of the cast, but is still competent as the typical man who believes problems between men should be sorted the way ‘men solve problems’.Kate Winslet plays the career woman who is forced to look into domestic problems because her husband is too indifferent towards these matters and ‘expects’ her to take care of it. Like Jodie Foster’s character, hers also has a see-sawing graph which requires an immense understanding of the art of ‘being’ a character. Needless to say, Winslet excels.My personal favourite in the film is the immensely talented Christoph Waltz as the BlackBerry addict attorney who is forced to be a part of the proceedings because he is the ‘father’ of one of the children involved. His BlackBerry seems to buzz at precisely the moment it shouldn’t, and every single time, his response to it, though the same, is priceless. While the title Carnage makes it sound more like an “I’m Duke Nukem, I’m gonna blast the beep out of your beep” film, the carnage here is more metaphysical. A classic character study, it is insightful, quirky and immensely entertaining. Though not necessarily a big screen watch in terms of visuals, Carnage is a film ideally enjoyed in a crowd. It is a real pity that the crowds are clearly not flocking to the theatres for this one.

With Cars 2, either you can sit back, relax and breeze through the film, the experience of which you would have forgotten within an hour of leaving the hall. Or you could deconstruct it, and see the formulae unfold. Watch the film if you want to have some fun over the weekend and definitely watch the film if you feel infuriated about this whole sequel-culture that is floating about, so you know the exact prototype. ","Every film studio in the current day and age is experiencing a domino effect. Ever since the first one, (bonus points for telling me which) decided it would be a cool idea to make a sequel of successful film – the idea has being flying from studio to director as if it were the most innovative thing since a nose trimmer. Cars 2  is no different than the fundamental process of wanting to double the success of an original film. The first film, Cars was a depictive story of an anthropomorphic world of cars, their races and their lives; Cars 2 follows from the same plot, where world champion Lighting McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his best friend tow-trunk Mater (Larry The Cable Guy) head to Europe and Japan to participate in the World Grand Prix. Meanwhile, Mater gets whirl-pooled into an international espionage.The movie is cute, you can’t take that away, with all it’s inside jokes about cars and a motor-ridden lifestyle. In this world, a car with open wheels is considered “good looking”, and they’ve managed to incorporate the fuel versus electricity debate, which sucks you in – as a movie about cars could have the potential to alienate a few. There are a few sequences that are visually engaging and lot’s of fun to watch, like the opening sequence which plays around with a Bond-like night-time raid on a ship. The background music is head-popping and fast-paced, and the crisp, tight-cutting animated shots make you sit back and go, “okay this could be a fun two hours”. However, it might be Pixar’s (the animation studio behind Toy Story, Wall- E and The Incredibles) reputation or just that fact that the original film Cars, was a surprisingly feel-good, intelligent film that set the bar high for the sequel, but both these factors work against the film. That’s the biggest problem with sequels - fundamentally, all the laughs, the jokes, the plot points feel rehearsed and forced. So when you laugh at the few moments in the film, you feel cheated. Cheated by a beer-bellied man in a tux is sitting behind a high-rising chair in a swanky office in LA smirking at his latest commercial investment. And maybe you wouldn’t want that image in your head while you’re watching a feel-good animation film. Exactly at that point, the film starts to drop, as if there is some higher force governing the point at which the film gets predictable.A side note on the animation of the film – the features of every car are innovative and true to the car's character, whether it’s the buck-teeth of Mater or the handsome open wheels of Francesco Bernaulli, Lightening McQueen’s rival (voiced by John Turturro, and possibly the most entertaining character of the film). strong>Cars 2  is a fun weekend watch for you to unwind and sit with a large tub of popcorn. That is if you can channel out the voice of your movie-watching conscience. The same conscience that is trying to break your acceptance of lazy, “timepass” watches, that try to determine your intellect. Cars 2  is a decent film, and after a long week, you could treat yourself to a light film - but maybe it’s time to look at the larger picture, and much more stimulating alternatives to what you consider as treats.

Nair, the man who founded the National Film Archives of India, Shivendra Singh Dungarpur’s Celluloid Man is pure love for cinema. If cinema is your life, you can’t miss this.","Perhaps the biggest tragedy of the film viewing culture in India is how disinterested most of us are in documentaries. Most people equate documentaries with a yawn, perhaps. But if ever someone who loves cinema but doesn’t like documentaries needed an example of how gripping, emotional and narratively-strong a documentary can be, without venturing too far from their comfort zone, the film to show them would be Shivendra Singh Dungarpur’s acclaimed documentary Celluloid Man.The film is a deeply personal and nostalgic take on the life of P. K. Nair, the man almost wholly responsible for what is now known as the National Film Archives of India (NFAI), in Pune. And through the journey of the film, we also understand what true passion for cinema is; how someone can be so devoted to collecting and archiving films for posterity, because he understands what very few people do – that perhaps films offer the most comprehensive and indicative representation of the times, even if most of the films he collected and archived were ‘fiction’. Shot by some of the foremost cinematographers in India - names like Santosh Thundiyil, K. U. Mohanan, Mahesh Aney, Vikas Sivaraman, Kiran Deohans and the likes – the film also looks at Mr. Nair’s life through the eyes of the some of the most respected names in Indian cinema; a number of them being former students of Mr. Nair from the Film & Television Institute of India. Through rich anecdotes and little stories that highlight the man’s tireless work and the result of it – prints of tens of thousands of film from across the world stored, the work of great masters worth many times their weight in gold - the film is a heartfelt ride that is inspiring and humbling at the same time.Clocking in at a two and a half hours, the film still felt too short, for me; so beautifully engaging was the story of the man who, I must shamefully admit, I didn’t know of before I heard about this film in late 2012. While primarily being about the life of P. K. Nair, through his journey, the film also touches upon so many little-known facts of India’s film history and the people behind it. Just the mere names of some of the legends mentioned – Ritwik Ghatak, for example - gave me goosebumps. Then, to hear of how highly these stalwarts of Indian cinema regarded Mr. Nair, aptly sums up his immeasurable contribution to the documentation of the history of Indian cinema. The painstaking manner in which he went about acquiring and restoring prints, the way in which he encouraged his students to view cinema the way it must be viewed, the little joys he experienced when acquiring a particular print brought with it it’s own little highs and lows – we live all of this and so much more through the film.If there were any problems I found, they were more with directorial choices than anything else. So, one can disagree with them, but one can’t fault with them. They were, after all, choices made by the director, ones that he was completely entitled to. For example, the manner in which certain scenes involving Mr. Nair were ‘staged’ for the documentary; they were quite obviously shot for visual appeal and to propel the story forward, even though they aren’t a part of Mr. Nair’s routine. Or even those interludes with the director’s own voiceover used to bring certain information to the fore. As I said, I can only disagree with them in their usage, but they can’t really be faulted. Then, above all, the film is remarkable because it doesn’t just show you the importance of archiving cinema, but the importance of preserving memories of life, the importance of being passionate about what you do, the importance of understanding that your life will only be worthwhile if you do your best to ensure that it means something. Celluloid Man will move you, and will reinforce the fact that cinema is life.

A decent basic plot riddled by need for item numbers and long-drawn scenes that make the writers look clueless. ,"Recall a movie that you've thoroughly enjoyed. Remember the feeling of excited and gleeful anticipation for the next line because you are enjoying every bit of whatever is unfolding in front of you. That would be very close to what I experienced in the first 20-25 minutes of Chaalis Chauraasi. And then I tried to fight the boredom coming from a flat narrative and I lost the battle.There is still the foursome Naseeruddin Shah, Kay Kay Menon, Atul Kulkarni and Ravi Kishanwho try to keep up the energy and chemistry they had generated earlier on. But their effort has to be too manifold to make up for the deteriorating pace of the narrative. The downfall starts with the flashbacks of the characters. In hind sight, not only are the backstories a hindrance to the flow, they are also unnecessary. Nothing is made out of those histories in the rest of the film to justify the screen time they eat up.  Same goes for the item numbers. Though they have cute lyrics and it's fun to watch Naseeruddin Shah use his dancing skills in an item song, the variety wears out by the second song. It’s a shame that a director, Hriday Shetty who could be doing better things had to resort to the regular ""commercial"" modes. At the most, one song can be accepted as a part of the script, the others are all forced. I know, I could copy-paste the earlier paragraph in almost every review I write (which is why I usually avoid any mention of songs, unless they are extremely good or bad.) But I choose to elaborate here because this film could have hit bull's eye if it were not for such intrusions. It had the cast, the slightly off-center style of direction, the off-beat story going for it. A potentially quick, zany, crisp film has given way for a plot that lost itself on the way to home run. It’s a shame because there are very few films which have a good story line from start to finish. And Chaalis Chauraasi is one of them. The problem is what they chose to fill it up with. The comedy of errors loses its charm almost as if the dialogue writers lost their inspiration and the director felt over-inspired to elongate every other scene a little more than was necessary to keep the audience interested. Yet, I'd look forward to Hriday Shetty's next film. It just feels like Chaalis Chauraasi was his attempt at finding his footing. Here's hoping he has.

Chaar Din Ki Chandni is a lot of ado about nothing at all. And it doesn't intend to be anything more than nothing either. ,"Chaar Din Ki Chandni is one of the films that make you wonder 'Why did they bother?' or at least 'Why did you bother watching it?' Exasperating and as repeatedly pointed out by Anupam Kher's character - loud and garish - Chaar Din Ki Chandni gets on your nerves almost from the moment the director introduces himself as the narrator, that is scene 1.And loud and garish pretty much describes each character and the over-the-top performance each actor uses to demonstrate the particular idiosyncrasy assigned to their character. From Anupam Kher, Om Puri, and Farida Jalal to Sushant Singh, Chandrachur Singh, Mukul Dev and Rahul Singh. The few exceptions are Anita Raj, Tusshar Kapoor, Kulraj Randhwa and surprisingly Johnny Lever. That doesn't mean Johnny Lever isn't loud, it just means his earsplitting voice is at least justifiable considering what his character has faced. Similarly, Tusshar Kapoor's non-loudness is only relative. And he is mildly amusing when he dons the avatar of a sardar. That just leaves Anita Raj and Kulraj Randhwa who are the only respite from this otherwise insufferable thing masquerading around as a film. The story is the ages-old one about family not approving of a partner that their son has fallen in love with. The sub-plots are contrived and stretched beyond tolerable; and kills the joke in the couple of times there could've been a decent one. Mistaken identities, blatant cover-ups, and a hundred white lies later the plot is so convoluted that you are left with no emotion to attach to the characters or the plot. What with every man in the disapproving family falling for the disapproved woman - head over heels and vulgar in turns - à la but nothing like Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Naram Garam. She of course, is brilliant at exactly the same thing that each of the four men are interested in - guns, alcohol, whatever say you. The exuberant, all-knowing woman that she is. I wonder if the latest courses in story-writing and acting have a separate chapter on the ever-spirited, boisterous yet cultured charmer of a woman that our films invariably have these days. Whether or not they have that, they surely don't have a chapter on thinking long and hard about the name you give your film. The Hindi phrase Chaar Din Ki Chandni is the first part of Chaar Din Ki Chandni, phir andheri raat which translates to 'Four days' of good times (moonlit nights), and then ensues darkness'; very much like the phrase '9 days' wonder'. The lead character is called Chandni, certainly they didn't mean what the title implies for their lead character. Or is this one of those clear cases of viewer spending more time reading into the script than the makers spent on reading it?

More so for the target audience - kids. It’s the preachy monologues towards the end and the on-the-face-ridiculous-climax that blemish the experience.","There are no pretensions here of making this a profound message movie to please all ages. It is very clearly meant for kids below ten and doesn't lose focus. In fact, they bank heavily upon the supposedly limited movie watching experience of these children. This is evident through the very expected turn of events - from the micro sub-sub-plots to the ultimate climax. It’s the sweet understated instances that keep the wire live though. Fantasy tales fascinate me immensely. We leave the whole world open for the storyteller to explore. He can take us anywhere he wishes with no obligation to stick to reality. It is entirely up to him to use the leverage that we so liberally give him.  Yet Jay (story writer) has very admirably tried his best to remain rooted to the ground. The side effect though is that the basic plot is pretty much unimaginative and thus has no surprises. The restraint shows in all other departments too. The camerawork very appropriately doesn't take you dizzying through MTV land. Which also means the editor is not behaving as if he has these new toys called 'scissors' and 'sticky tape'. Sorry guys, forgive me, I have still not overcome the shock called Jhoom Barabar Jhoom. Visually, Chain Kulii Ki Main Kulii equals a soothing boat ride on a calm lake while Jhoom Barabar Jhoom equals a rocky car ride on the potholed monsoon roads of Pune (India). Okay - digression ends here. Rahul Bose is his usual calm and composed self too. The kids behave like kids except for the one or two times that they get all philosophical and reflective on the adults. Patently unnatural. And the other dialogues are too natural and thus basically boring. The music is actually infuriating. Especially ""Sunday Sunday"" which is a blatant copy of ""Na bole tum na maine kuch kaha"" of Baton Baton Mein.However, I did quite enjoy the spoof cricket world created. They had it all - the mandatory Sardar (Sikh), the left-handed captain star-batsman, the Muslim pace bowler, the number 10 T-shirt, a coach that experiments with the batting line-up, and last but not the least - a chauvinistic dig at the female commentator who ""obviously"" knows nothing about the game. So, plan of action for the weekend - take the kids to the theater while you stay out looking for some other form of entertainment to alternate between loo and fag breaks. And at the end of it all, together you can say, ""What fun!?""

In fact, there seems to be no internal struggle as far the friendship is concerned, then why have it in the first place.

Well, Chala Mussaddi - Office Office does not sermonize and yet is a mind-numbing bore. ","A film supposedly about the common man represented by Mussaddi did not make me identify with him, even though I've gone through situations as Mussaddi. What could be a bigger failure of the film?Have there been times when you are watching a film and there is a side-story interesting enough that makes you say, ""wow, that can be a film by itself."" Looks like, the makers of Chala Mussaddi - Office Office had a similar epiphany when they were watching Lage Raho Munnabhai's pensioner scene. Unfortunately, they have made an awfully pale tale out of it. A tale that a talent like Pankaj Kapoor couldn't do anything to help. I look forward to Pankaj Kapoor films and somehow even as I watched the trailer of Chala Mussaddi - Office Office, I cringed at the stereotypical babu (bureaucrat) representation. The irony is that had I heard just the concept, it would have excited me. I don't think there can be enough films made about how deeply engrained corruption is. But we don't really want our films to be an exaggerated and repetitive staging of reality. The characters are all caricatures and the regular amount of disgust-inducing. While I liked the fact that the same actors appeared in various roles, there was no theme to it and soon that too became boring. The one good thing about the film is that characters don't suddenly transform. The good-for-nothings and dishonest remain so. No amount of speeches and appeals move the hard-hearted bureaucrats. It can also be said that the climax is sort-of, kind-of redeeming because of the circular reference it gets into. Also, it takes the action to a high after the recurring theme of Mussaddi going from office to office to get what is rightfully his in the first place. But, then again the answer is too idealistic and simplistic.Then again, maybe the solution is simple. Maybe our work against corruption starts at home with simple things. Maybe the point is to not let the problem become so big that we have to stage a theatrical climax as our solution. Sorry to digress though, these thoughts of mine are despite this inconsequential film.

No surprises there. It fails to teach in an interesting way despite being in the capable hands of Shabana Azmi, Juhi Chawla and Divya Dutta.","Chalk N Duster comes across as a personal film. As in the writer/director/producer has either had a teacher in his life who he wanted to pay a tribute to or know of a teacher or two who have been insulted by the people who make education a business. The unempathatic attitude towards teachers in general is attacked with single-minded focus. While not a bad premise in itself, the discrepancies within the theme and real life are too large to stop nagging for even one minute of the film. The film is set in a private school where real-life teachers are treated much better than the way shown in the film. The issues of the teachers in government schools are not addressed at all. Which is alright, if the story is about a private school. But then, it doesn't stay a story of a private school but becomes one in which the common man gets involved and there is huge drama with teachers having to take a test. I haven't been able to wrap my head around the logical flow of the premise though. If the matter is of national interest, it is a social issue. If the issue is social, then the representative example used to resemble something in real life. In which case, a private school with ample funding doesn't fit the bill. Here we completely ignore the fact that most real-life teachers  aren't really great teachers. This is also the opportune place to mention the irony of the 'and' in the film's title being spelt as 'n'. Is that the makers' way of saying their methods are not outdated?As with any movie that doesn't make logical sense, you accept the premise and focus on the execution. There too Chalk N Duster fails big time. Too much time is spent in coloring the vamp darker and darker. Even if we resist complaining about the time spent in making the victimized teachers good at heart and loving by nature, the mechanisms used to demonstrate these are sappy and unengaging.Despite all of the above, the film manager to tug you emotionally for a bit in the second half. When villains are all black, they have to be menacing and capable of all things inhuman. Divya Dutt as the principal, Kamini Sharma manages to make you hate her within the first few seconds of screen time. Similarly, Shabana Azmi evokes enough sympathy to root for her character, Mrs. Sawant. So restrained is her performance in a role that could have been laden with drama that Juhi Chawla's controlled (non-shrieking), Jyoti. This is all soon undone with a ridiculous climax. To start with, it reinforces the Indian education system's obsession with rote learning. Then there's testing the teacher's knowledge instead of teaching skills. Lastly, the concept itself is too lame for the amount of buildup towards the climax. Save a few good performances then, Chalk N Duster is just another story about honest, diligent workers vs. big, bad management; about the common man vs. the system. Other than the 'education' angle there is nothing new, which is a shame because this angle actually has a lot of scope to be novel. Especially when it was in the capable hands of Shabana Azmi, Juhi Chawla and Divya Dutta.

Maybe this is their attempt at picking the pace a bit post-interval, but it didn't work for me.Maybe because I had settled into the lazy, pleasant stroll that the film had set-up. The shift in the quantity and quality of events thereafter came as a jolt. The subtle hints on the Mumbai vs. Delhi attitude, the city vs. small-town mentality, the upper middle class vs. lower middle-class divide transform into on-the-face comments about the society we live in and socio-politics take over.But with Vinay Pathak and his all-so refreshing performance, everything looks tolerable. That Lara Dutta wasn't acting as if she had no brains was an added bonus. They had some very nice witty, everyday language going on too. The well-executed camera work and the engaging background music made the experience even better. Usually, when these departments draw attention, it gets registered in my head negatively. But here they add a lot to the two hours spent on the film. Go along, be the third person watching all the fun on this funny, quirky journey, even if it’s a DVD watch.

No chance of being entertained or enlightened.","The world of an aspiring actor (Shahid Kapoor) in big bad Bollywood. His tiny failures making him into a big-time LOSER, his mini-successes adding up to nothing substantial. You heard it over and over again. You've watched it at least 4 times a year. But you are hopeful that it will still be told in a way you'd enjoy; that this sorry guy will appeal to you; that you'll feel bad for him. But the makers of Chance Pe Dance don't care enough to get you involved, so there's nothing much you can give them other than maybe some eye-rolls. Just when Shahid Kapoor was beginning to grow on me as an actor he completely irritated me. The faces he pulls, the way he carries himself are only annoying. Genelia D'souza is her regular chirpy-bubbly self and I wonder when we'll know if she can do anything else. Sure, she has her occasional emotional moment here, but nothing to remember her by. Can I really blame her? With such a regressive role written for her, there is only so much a girl can be expected to do. Tina, the budding choreographer she plays, is supposedly good at her job. She begins to like a guy and her life as her own ends? Why? Or maybe they are trying to comment on the undying love that a woman is capable of. Though the way the story is narrated, I doubt the writers had any such lofty aims. Laziness, they had loads of. Okay, lets' assume for a while that detailed characters was not something the writers had on mind. They wanted to create a story about opportunities and how you take them can make or break you. But, unfortunately, the lines in the film are as lame as that last line I just wrote. And the events in the film are so functional and episodic. They don't flow into each other. They just come and go as is convenient. Now, if the characters are going to behave like you'd expect them to, and if they are going to spout lines, ad verbatim what's playing in your mind, the story is bound to be predictable. There's no attempt to deviate from the norm. What's left than is the backdrop of the film. Both Sameer and Tina are supposed to be awesome dancers. What I know after watching this film is that Genelia and Shahid are awesome with aerobics. Dancing? Maybe we'll have to wait for another day, another film. For now, let's just say the entire team got all the moves wrong.

A couple of 'wows' for Deepika Padukone's karate hu-aa. But that's in absolute terms.

She looks alright, nothing overly charming or beautiful. But not 'the girl next door' either. She's not completely blank but is still going through the motions. Who am I kidding? There is really no character(s) under whose skin she could let her talent(?) grow and show. Yeah, yeah, yeah...time to give credit where it's due. Yep! There were a couple of things I liked. Akshay Kumar's character, Sidhu is extremely consistent. There's no point where the event of the moment inspired him to grow brains. The way the character grew gradually didn't seem out of place or sudden. Like with Nikhil Advani's earlier venture Salaam-e-ishq, I found the tiny spoof-type sub-plots interesting. There are these infomercials which pop up every once in a while. A comment on blind faith is made in passing. I'm curious how such issues make their way into an absolute crazy caper.

You don’t want to watch a bunch of non-actors in a shabbily edited thriller, even if the story is not-bad.","A producer who casts not his son, or his grandchild, but himself in the film, has to be desperate. And watching Dr. Anuuj Saxena's non-acting non-skills, it seems to have crossed a really high threshold of desperation. I mean, if I want him to go back into coma after he's been in the vegetable condition for half the film, there's something wrong with this Doctor, no?Ok, if not that, then at least the fact that Udita Goswami is being cast as a nurse who wears pink, tight mini-skirt and top, should give the desperation away? Actually, I shouldn't be so caustic. At least there was an attempt at having a story and half interesting characters. But, I guess you can sympathize with me having to spend 100 minutes watching Udita trying to act sexy. I'm just praying my dreams won't feature her. Or the other woman, Tareena Patel. Or any of the men. Least of all the police officer with the lisp or the main lead with his God-awful diction. Oops, I already complained about him, didn't I? Well, the point is that the story was not half bad, but there were way too many continuity jerks. Especially, in the action sequences. An action flick has to have action that I can see an appreciate to be slick. But in this one, it's more like the tight budget and editing tools were used more to cover the difficult-to-do action sequences rather than make it a fast-paced thriller. Oh well, another one that can be skipped unless you have absolutely-absolutely nothing to do.

From Siddharth's over-zealous gestures to Ali Zafar's pretentious dialogue delivery to Tapsee Pannu's cute-yet-flat portrayal of Seema as the film's center of attention - it is one assault on your ears after another.

Even the silliest of silly comedies from the leave-your-brains-behind genre should have gone beyond these done-to-death tools of making its audience laugh. Oh yeah, and their first cousins, toilet and sexual humor. Needless to say, David Dhawan's Chashme Baddoor has the lowest possible form of gags in each of the above categories.

Chashme Baddoor chooses to completely ignore all that was good about Chashme Buddoor - the simplicity and the satire. Instead, it goes on to make what was bad, worse. For example, the climax is made even more implausible. Amidst this then, it is interesting that there was some attempt at being different in the way the songs were shot. They are loud and are far from melodious, as expected. But some smart editing and camerawork makes them stand out in this otherwise thoughtless execution. Other than that though, there isn't much they could do. After all, Chashme Buddoor had music from the pre-70s to pay tribute to, whereas yesteryears for current films is the 90s.It is difficult to decide if my urge to cry was more because of the silly lines or because some part of the audience was enjoying it whole-heartedly. Some silliness is just so bad that it makes you laugh, Chashme Baddoor's brand of stupidity doesn't even fall in that category. ""What else did you expect?"" Is a question I have no answer to.

It builds a tense atmosphere right from the beginning when two men get down from a rickety bus and begin to walk fast in desperation. The camera tracks them and follows them from the outskirts, where they alight, to throughout the city. Who are they? What colid have happened? What are they up to? A lot of questions come to the mind. The net reslit is that you find yourself captivated.However, the director doesn't make any effort to introduce them any further. So, an uncertainty over what to exactly make of them prevails. They remain strangers, to the city and to us. But this is not the main story. This is just the framing story through which the director prepares us to suspect the film's characters and thus succeeds in putting us in a paranoid state of mind, the sort that may be rampant during the times of communal tension, when trusting anybody is not easy.Slowly, the framing narrative dissolves into the main story. For me, this was the finest part of the film--how the framing narrative leads you on. Without really ever letting you know that you are being brought into a particliar village household, where you are going to stay for a large part of the film. Here, amidst a palpably eerie and fearful atmosphere, an Amorres-Perros-like tale unfolds, underlining the irony of human existence.Cauthi Koot is a fine example of minimal filmmaking, where the idea is to achieve more through less. The cinematic elements are reduced to a bare minimum, for example:
Chauthi Koot employs all of these to further achieve and convey the paranoia and distrust that prevailed during the times of Punjab militancy.  It also uses a technique, which I would like to call pseudo-climax, in which you are given the illusion that the story has reached its natural peak but the filmmaker is just playing with your sentiments - the real peak and resolve are still far and one has to continue to roll towards them. And when they actually arrive, the suddenness and abruptness shock you - things happen sans the cinematic build-up, just like they wolid in real life. The reality is harsher and more ironic than how a filmmaker would prepare you to face it. You could even say that the filmmaker himself leaves the pretense of filmmaking midway, after the pseudo-climax, and adopts a more maverick route to bring you to a realistic destination.This latter maverick part may seem scattered, the events don't look well-connected, but that's because the filmmaker has literally loosened his grip over the characters. An Iranian filmmaker, Jafar Panahi, had played with this technique in his 1997 film Ayneh (The Mirror), wherein the storytelling suddenly changes tracks at its peak - the pseudo-climax, to leave its scripted and dramatized outlook to acquire an unscripted and candid documentary-like form. Chauthi Koot doesn't go that far but, yes, you would be a little perplexed after its pseudo-climax. However, structured or semi-structured, the journey is worth taking. The movie is worth watching. The paranoia is worth experiencing. If  tense, minimal, gloomy movies about human condition interest you, do add it to your must-watch list.

Unfortunately, the events develop at a pace that unplugs you instead of getting you hooked. Also, since the non-linear narration is not from any particular point of view, the twists seem random and all over the place. This makes the non-linearity itself rather haphazard.  The base story takes its own time to formulate and settle down. On the way it develops the main characters' frustration with their situation. However, the different traits of these characters are not given full vent. And thus, the initial character development seems in vain. Unfortunately, yet again, the only way a woman can achieve anything is by using her sexuality, however intelligent she is. The actors playing these characters also give no earth-shattering performances, but neither does any one of them make you pull your hair apart. Each one is just doing his/her bit. The voiceover narrative style used throughout the movie gives the feel of watching a choppy chain of events rather than a story flowing from one plot into another. However, it was a nice touch to have the voiceovers pass judgments about other characters also, rather than just narrating the story.My basic problem is with the pace of the movie. A thriller has to be on the move. It cannot pause to take a breather; it cannot stop on seashores just because. A pause has to be about something, it has to be pregnant, has to do something via the background music or the camerawork. But here the pauses just exist because the director thinks he is building suspense. Nope...tedium he is surely building.Had it been shorter by 15 minutes, it could well have been worth a watch. But people crossing and double-crossing and double-double-crossing till they themselves lose track is pretty annoying by the time the end credits roll.

R Balki (Balkrishnan), the debutant director, has done a commendable job, and not since Farhan Akhtar’s Dil Chahta Hai has a first directorial venture come out so impressively. Like Farhan in DCH, Balki has done the story himself and has come up with well-etched out characters. The characterization has been done so well that even cameos like the chef’s crew or medical store-owner impress.
The performances of Amitabh and Tabu are of the highest quality, though Tabu impresses a little more than Big B, and her screen persona at times reminds you of Shabana Azmi. Both lead actors impress with their comical timing (non-slapstick) and their Urdu diction is always spot-on - I wish the irritating journalists of ‘Aaj Tak’ could speak Urdu like this.
The movie also marks the return of music maestro Illaiyaraja, and he has done a tidy job. The mellifluous ""Jane do na"" number by Shreya Ghoshal has a lilting effect. Singer Vijay Prakash has done Amitabh's playback wonderfully well - thank god there is no Sudesh Bhonsle for a change!
Editing by Chandan Arora is slick and glitch-free.  PC Sreeram’s Cinematography is impressive, and he has captured the locales of both London and Delhi beautifully. The dialogues of Cheeni Kum clearly take the cake, with the sarcastic repartee every now and then being the flavour of the movie.
Remember Ayesha kapoor? The girl who bagged all the awards for her role in Black. Well, she is not there in the movie, but she might have been one of Balki’s inspirations while writing the movie (more on this in the notepad section).
The movie is primarily a comedy, but it is neither devoid of a story, nor is it a palliative for the neurons. And what’s more, it has a message too, which the young at heart would surely love. 
Vis-à-vis other movies of its ilk, Cheeni Kum comfortably scores over Jogger’s Park (though JP had richer & varied music) and Nishabd. Amitabh’s role is cleanly developed and thankfully there are no traces of the gaucherie of Sexy Sam.
All in all, Cheeni Kum is a movie that should certainly be watched. The movie has one or two small sequences (though comical), which may warrant parental discretion, so decide for yourselves if you would like to take your kids along. 
Happy viewing!

140,238,238,238,238,Chef,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewNotepadPreview35 Critic Reviews 2.9/5.0 1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/chef-review/,2.9/5.0,5/5.0,,4.1,"Chef made me wonder, what makes me sadder - a film which starts off very well, but ends up being just about average or one that isn't enjoyable at all.","Very few movies about relationships take the relationship seriously enough to give it some depth, spend time on its development. Even fewer submit to everyday interactions and language to make the relationship seem real. As a pleasant surprise, Chef does that. Unfortunately, it also gets too real and has all kinds of characters preach to a character who seems lost in life. It  is also slightly difficult to connect with a protagonist who is a tad too unsure of himself and sways with the wind, like a long blade of grass – while taking some very important decisions about his relationships and career. Chef is an immersive experience in the first half, though. It might have to do with Kerala's serenity in the backdrop. But, the film also comes across as one which is sure about itself. It doesn't hurry. In fact, it is so unrushed that you wonder why other movies are always sprinting from one scene to another, one situation to another. And, it doesn't get uninteresting. The lilting pace only grows on you little by little. Until interval. Chef's second half sees the writers struggle to keep things engaging. In the process, they lose the world of charming comfort and ease that they created. It seems like they had a climax in mind and by hook or crook they wanted to get there. They had some ideas such as a road trip, a father-son tiff, and so on which they retrofitted towards this climax Along the way, they give up on the organic chemistry they created between ex-husband and ex-wife, and father and son. The male-bonding between two friends too seemed like a force-fit rather than a germane aspect of the script. It is a shame indeed that despite enjoying the first half as much as I did, I have mostly been complaining about the film so far. Chef does get some subtleties right. The healthy relationship a divorced couple shares explains the attraction that they must have felt towards each other – especially considering they have opposing characteristics. Hot-headed Roshan (Saif Ali Khan) and a calm and centered Radha (Padmapriya) make you believe that opposites attract. There are other nuances that aren't spelled out either – the genetic flow of “being full of oneself” from father to son to grandson; the marketing suave that the current generation seems to be born with; parents who humor their child's lies; the intimation that a handsome, middle-aged man can cause;  the intimidation that another handsome, middle-aged man can feel; even the “intellectual” dialogue doesn't seem haughty but feels natural within the flow of the film – these details aren't something you spot in Hindi films too frequently. I completely cherished it. While it lasted. These little pleasures could have been very easily taken away if it were not for a refreshingly composed cast. This is the Saif Ali Khan I thoroughly enjoy watching – not entirely romantic, not entirely brazen, just the right amount of any gray character. Interestingly enough, I found Padmapriya's  comfort with her body the most enchanting. She carries her own brand of attractiveness and she makes a whole range of emotions seem absolutely effortless in just one phone call. But that aside, her body positivity backs up her reassured presence and that makes her character stand out. Speaking of which, I found myself smiling every time one Mr. Milind Soman presented himself on the screen. It is not just how mind-blowingly good-looking he is. It is also how uncomfortable he makes Roshan feel, by doing nothing but being there. In this believable ensemble, unfortunately, Svar Kamble's (Armaan, Roshan's son) enthusiasm comes across as relatively unnatural. This grasp of characters is a fine example of interplay between performances and some solid characterisations. If only, the writers hadn't lost the grip later in the film. They have capable support in the music, camera and editing departments. Every time there was food on the screen, my mouth watered. That is the success of a film which calls itself Chef. But, then the taste is watered down with glib sermons. Even if they are called out for being “gyaan”, that's what they remain – sermons. The only credit that can be given to the gyaan*-giving aspect of the film is that it is what would most likely happen in real life too, if a 40 year old is roaming around listless. Yet, Chef could make for a warm film to watch along with your kids. Not because it has life lessons or owing to the parent-child relationship. It is more to watch a reasonably well-made film and spend some fun time together. Yes, despite the average last hour. knowledge would be gyaan*'s literal meaning; however within the context of the film it is knowledge that sounds like it is from a quotable quote.

As complete as any Rohit Shetty film is. Well, sans Ajay Devgn. So, you don't have his cool personality to bring calm or at least a break from the over-the-top state of affairs. Even otherwise, Shah Rukh Khan's facial contortions (except for when he has this one romantic twinkle in his eyes) remind me of our origins as a race. Here, he is actually supposed to make you laugh with all the monkey business. Yet, despite all my apathy towards the tomfoolery, there was one scene that got me the goose bumps. Of course, it was too little too late.It doesn't help that not only are the jokes as predictable as every other SMS joke, the self-referencing SRK one-liners are predictable too! For the rest of the dialogue you are left with emotional/philosophical lines sound like they were picked from a book of quotes. What could have been funny if it happened once, either repeats itself or goes on for too long to kill whatever little joy it started with.You wonder then, whether or not you should complain about half the film being in Tamil. I have no clue if the heavy mockery of what the Tamilians wear, how they speak, what they eat, how they eat is offensive. But I didn't find it in good taste. The only one trying to add grace to everything else, is Deepika Padukone. Since, I don't know if her diction was right or not, I can only say she didn't look convincing. Maybe, because it was apparent that she was trying really hard.Through her character, an attempt is made to send a message across to the men of the nation. But again, the setting is way too off the topic for most of the length of the film to suddenly become about a particular social issue. All you can do is thank Rohit Shetty for small mercies - for having at least tried to make the film about something, a little less random.After this gratitude then, all you can do is come out feeling happy that it wasn't worse than you expected. And at least, the crowd around you, the people this film is made for had a good time.

142,240,240,240,240,Children of War,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review,/movie/children-war-review/,,,,3.033333333,"Mrityunjay Devvrat's Children of War is a beautifully shot, disturbing film that falls short of being truly special because of the lack of an emotional core. It depends on visuals to make you feel pain and suffering; but there's only so much that haunting frames can touch the heart in cinema. For that, what one really needs are characters and stories.","Children of War is what I'd like to call an over-directed film. Beautifully shot to a fault, and dealing with one of the most tragic but oft-forgotten chapters in the history of our subcontinent, Mrityunjay Devvrat's film is a devastating look at Bangladesh's struggle for independence, in the wake of then West Pakistan's Operation Searchlight - a systematic attempt to subdue the call for East Pakistan's independence by resorting to cold-blooded mass murder.There is much to appreciate in the film, no doubt about that. The story of the film is important, and its intent cannot be questioned at all. But, in spite of being a fictionalized account, the film is too focused on atmosphere and recreating the sheer extent of the tragedy, than in any real storytelling; this, despite the fact that the film follows three different stories intermittently.There's the story of the journalist whose life is thrown out of gear when he is violently and unexpectedly separated from his wife; then there's a pair of young siblings orphaned by war; and finally there is one smaller thread where a young Bangladeshi man attempts to keep the flame of revolution alive through an impassioned speech. The stories and characters, however, play second fiddle to continuously occurring scenes of torture, suffering and oppression of innocent Bangladeshi's by the Pakistani army. There are long montages of bodies, blood and death. Each of these is beautifully shot and hit you in the gut; but there's just too much of it happening.Everything in the film, in fact, is in excess. The background score is almost always heavy. The performances, even by stalwarts like Victor Banerjee, Pawan Malhotra and the late Farooque Shaikh saab, are far too theatrical. Too many pauses, too much drama. And yet, the story moves along at too slow a pace. At 162 minutes, this makes the film at least 30 minutes longer than it deserved to be.The film hurts you; it makes you wish that humankind had the sense to see that to be human is to show compassion. Thousands and thousands of babies were born of the rapes of Bangladeshi women during those tragic months in the lead up to surrender of Pakistani troops, and the film makes you see that such large scale human suffering could so easily be avoided if we let our instinct for compassion overrule our lust for power.Yet, Children of War seems like a lost opportunity. The film could have risen so much more if it had let the characters and their story speak more than just the beautifully grotesque imagery. In fact, one can't help but wonder if the objective was to glorify the gut-wrenching suffering in any way. You'll know what I'm talking about, when you see this really lengthy shot of a crying toddler amidst blood-soaked corpses, one of them presumably of his mother, and the camera lingers long enough for you to start wondering what the child made to shoot the scene would have experienced, in exchange for the viewer being reinforced with a point that is made throughout the film anyway.Another personal peeve for me was how the language of the film is primarily Hindi, even though the language of the characters is obviously not. It would have seemed so much more authentic to have them speak Bengali instead. Children of War, then, is a film that misses out on being truly memorable, because it tries to visually rub in memories of a tragedy, rather than let us identify with characters who lived it. It is a brave film, and definitely one that stands apart from what we're subjected to on most Fridays, but it is also one that deserved to be so much more.

Does it matter, whether the chaddis (underwear) are pink or white, and whether they are the ladies' variety or kids'? Maybe kids can't start a revolution and what they want or think doesn't really matter. But, what if they took that extra step to make it matter? Would we stop it? I wouldn't which is why I fell for the Chillar Party. And yes, yes, Sallu bhai, you have surprised me, in a very, very pleasant way!","It's unlikely that kids have a smartass nickname for every-single-body they know (including the apartment complex they live in). For sure, kids do not take on powerful politicians to do what they think is right. But neither do kids solve mysteries like the  Famous Five or the Secret Seven. Chillar Party is a story. It asks us to think what we have grown into, from the innocent, straightforward children we once were. Chillar Party doesn't preach, it keeps things simple and that's what worked for me, especially the climax. It hits you just the right amount. And it gets the right spot too. A bunch of kids from middle class families fall in love with a homeless child and his dog. The stage is set for one those regular, ""I'm so sorry for you, that I need to help you"" story (very similar to Zor Laga Ke Haiyya). Which translates to -  the stage is set for kids acting too old for their age, preaching to adults who are always wrong, etc. This, in turn, translates to a lot of yawning. But, Chillar Party begins to surprise you. The surprises begin with little things. For example, there is no overt sympathy towards a child because he is less fortunate. He earns the sympathy he deserves, one bit after another. And all of it through play.  The Chillar Party gets no instant success, it has its share of struggle. Children behave the way children are most likely to behave. Well, almost. Of course, it's difficult to accept that kids can start a revolution. But in these times of internet and candle-light vigils, can we be sure that kids can't do it? It doesn't really take that much to make it to the breaking news, does it? Parents scold, are unreasonable and considerate as parents usually are. The child-parent or even the parent-parent interactions flow naturally. Ever been to a society meeting? There is this particular moment in which you see how every dad is a hero for his child. But, you know the dad is in a situation, that adults invariably find themselves in, which will take him far away from being a hero. Sure, the things the Chillar Party tries to do are larger-than-life. But who knows what we were capable of when we were children. I know my kids (ages 7 and 9) understand concepts though they might know the words adults use to describe them. I know they come up with the most awesome ideas when they are NOT asked to (and are asked not to, too!). Girls from my building (ages 6-9) have formed a ""creativity club"" and their first activity was to make ID cards for its members. And rule +1 is ""boys not allowed!"" Chillar Party is adorable and cute. Both the film, the members of the gang, and the actors who make the gang work. The music is catchy and fun. Kids are going to have a ball while watching the film. And there's hope that adults will remember the film a little after they are out of the theater. Especially when they are reminded of the lessons taught in school. No, no, not the ones that are ""really"" useless. The life hacks, we teach our kids but forget to follow through on. The kids might feel sorry for a stray dog (Oh, for the record, I don't even like dogs!). But, we as adults know Chillar Party is about something much larger. Us. The world we have made our home.

But kids will enjoy their time with Chintoo. Strictly not for adults though. ,"Chintoo feels like a film that was made by a team that really wanted to make a film for kids and show adults a child's point of view. Therein lies the contradiction. If it is a film for kids then why bother showing their point of view to adults? If the point is to show a child's perspective to adults, then the movie needed to be made for adults and not for kids only. Chintoo doesn't have enough material or rather is too childish to be considered a film for adults. Yet, it does work for kids because it does capture their way of looking at things around them and their imagination. Though it is not a must watch even for kids, it's not like kids have too much choice this summer. Chintoo is full of moments that are both worthy of spending time on and are executed well. But, they do not come together as one complete story. The build-up of the team called the 'waanar vede warriors', their acknowledgement for the need for fitness, the struggle of putting together their stadium, their aspirations, their struggle with an opposing bunch of children, and finally their battle against an adult who can't see their way - are among the many things that Chintoo wants to talk about. In the middle of all this you see various interconnections - parents struggle with today's age of couch-gaming, parents-as-a-unit and their relationship with a child, a mother-son tie, bonding between a grandparent and their child. Unfortunately, all these different things stay different and don't link with each other to form one smooth-flowing story. What makes Chintoo worthwhile (at least for kids) is that each of these sections is treated with a lot of love and care. For its little bit each section engages you and you look forward to what it is going to end up with. That it doesn't end up in anything substantial, meaningful or interesting is a different thing all together. In that sense, Chintoo might have aimed at the attention span of 10-year olds. As an adult, what started off for me as a perfect look into familial interactions between parents and children ended up as an overdose of the same whining that I had left behind at home for some peace and quiet in the theater. Yet, let me not speak on behalf of those for whom the Chintoo comics are reason for nostalgia. I didn't grow up with them and wouldn't know what that means to someone who has. On the other hand, I'd assume the film is directed equally towards people who hadn't read the comics. So, as a part of that audience I know that I have too many problems with how Chintoo panned out. From what has already been said to the innumerable questions that the climax with the many inconsistencies in writing throughout, Chintoo is far from a 'must watch' experience. Sure, the kids acted well but there was nothing exceptional about the performances. The adults all looked and sounded like caricatures except for Vibhavari Deshpande. But she does have too much make-up on which is extremely distracting. That and Subodh Bhave's wig/hair-do. So distracting that I choose to mention it before mentioning the apt amount of cuteness that the child artists have. Just the typical right amount that is. Just for the lack of choice that kids have this summer, Chintoo might be a film worth a watch for kids. For adults, we can survive with another week out of the theaters, can't we?

145,243,243,243,243,Chintuji,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review11 Critic Reviews 4.3/5.0 3 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/chintuji-review/,4.3/5.0,5/5.0,,4.766666667,,"Once upon a time, there was a little village city called Had-bahedi. The people there were content with what they had, despite knowing the world outside has a lot more conveniences. They were always happy to take when it's given without asking for anything. And then the world outside enters to impose itself on Had-bahedi. Yes, Chintuji is a fairy tale. And that by definition makes it imaginary. The writer is asking us to enter his make-believe world and think, ""exactly what will it take for this to be the real world"". Nice thought. But can't be taken forward given the complexities of the real world and their over-simplification for the sake of making it into a film. There isn't much you can comment about plausibility of plot points when the whole concept is intentionally unlikely to happen. The actors are meant to behave like they were in a street play. They are very purposefully loud and exaggeratedly comic.  Sure, the actors are a bit of a saving grace. Very few can pull of being adorable while being arrogant like Rishi Kapoor. Priyanshu looks sincere as he should be. The rest are all just vague caricatures that represent Had-bahedi.What remains then is the way the plot is carried out and to a certain extent the strength of the dialogues. Both are more or less mediocre. There are jumpy cuts, predictable situations and drama that is carried out way too long. The dialogues are wannabe non-preachy. Like a bolt of lightning a character asks an insightful question, realization strikes the questionee, and immediate transformation from haughty to charming happens.Ultimately fairy tales unless fairly complicated make for good stories for children. But, since Chintuji is about corruption, politics, egos, etc it isn't kid-material either. And it is fairly simplistic too. So other than a quiet ""well-tried"" applause, there ain't much we can give it.

Lead actress Tejaswini Lonari, who plays Chinu, is beautiful in a rather unconventional way. In fleeting moments, she showed flashes of being like - dare I say it - a semi-rustic Smita Patil.

148,246,246,246,246,Chitrafit 3.0 Megapixel,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review,/movie/chitrafit-30-megapixel-review/,,,,5.15,"The infusion of a social message into the story goes haywire, and doesn't looks appealing either. Moreover, it tries really hard to create drama through dialogue that lacks much-needed intensity.","There seems to some sort of desperate urge among producers to attempt unexplored genres in Marathi cinema of late. It is perhaps a safe bet for them. And if the subject is about sex, who is unwilling to back it? After all, such projects receive an unprecedented amount of publicity to begin with and guarantee at least return on investment in due course. Majority of them are purely box office-oriented, while few try to be remarkably different. In an endeavor to kill two birds with one stone, Chitrafit - 3.0 Megapixel ends up performing so badly that it neither appears money-making nor distinctive.The film is about victims of the illegal trade of filming and circulating sexually explicit videos or MMS. Writer-director Divakar Ghodake chooses to narrate the story through the eyes of a researcher during her visit to Pareni tribes. So he sets off the drama with the protagonist’s voiceover and this is where the film begins to falter. I fail to understand why her voiceover keeps telling you the story through the viewpoints of other characters as well.The mix-up of this touching tale with a socially-ingrained message is actually the biggest cause of its failure. The lack of emotional touch to the voiceover makes you wonder if the narrator really has any heart-wrenching story to tell or is just interested in making social commentary. As the film advances, this voiceover hardly creates any suspense and instead serves you spoilers throughout.As you must have guessed by now, Chitrafit - 3.0 Megapixel is actually the name of a MMS video (meaning a film clip shot on 3.0 MP camera). This video clip interestingly opens up with a message – “The whole event was scripted”. Appallingly, this event was scripted so shoddily that it cannot be categorized either as a film or a sex video. If the aim was to capture emotional turmoil of sexually-exploited women, the film is filled with multi-layered, confusing elements. And if the aim was to make a sex-driven film, it fails miserably.The film documents a real-life incidence that shocked rural Maharashtra few years ago, and so it is understandably set in the state’s scenic ghats. A few minutes into the film, you start wondering if you are actually witnessing some National Geographic program about picturesque Western Ghats. Stunning cold frames don’t add any value to the story however.In Love Sex Aur Dhoka, Dibakar Banerjee had planted cameras into his stories masterfully (except in an aspiring director’s one) – letting the camera narrate the film creatively and engagingly. In Chitrafit - 3.0 Megapixel, camera’s perspective (a mobile phone camera) is hardly used. Flashbacks or voiceover do little to help lay out the tale. The makers possibly didn’t want to create another LSD, and this is  logical too. But a better use of camera’s viewpoint would have at least stopped the film from being so predictable.Camera angles in the first MMS clip surely raise questions. If the camera is placed on ground, how in the world a high-angle shot is even filmed at an isolated place? Not only camera placements but also overall execution tells you a lot about the director’s carelessness about researching the subject. Not to mention well-composed, but ruthlessly used musical pieces.Foreplay scenes are way too superficial and poorly choreographed, while videos themselves look aesthetically gorgeous – missing the realistic punch. Both Seema Azmi (Chak De fame) and Ashish Pathode are uninteresting, despite their fine appearances for respective roles. Bleak dialogue and tiring background score make matters worse, and you quickly become impatient. At just 84 minutes; this film has shorter runtime than Dhobi Ghat, still it comes with an interval. Even so, a better edit could have easily cut it down to an hour or so, eventually making this predictable film far more engaging.Ghodake has apparently been credited in several Oscar-winning films for VFX and computer graphics. Fake-looking newspapers or camera lens in his directorial debut however create doubts.If you’re out there to witness some story, you’ll be disappointed from the very beginning. And if you want to see it just for sex, you will regret watching it till the end.

This movie brings only the two younger kids, Edmund and Lucy, and their intolerable cousin Eustace to Narnia to help Prince Caspian find the seven lords of Narnia on his ship, the Dawn Treader.A fluent flow of story and regular doses of excitement keeps you rooted to your seats through the run-time.

A good thing is that you don’t need to read the novels to understand this movie. Of course people who’ve read the series will argue differently because of a couple of changed sequences, but that is true of every classic fantasy novel adapted into a movie. I could see kids in the theatre tremendously enjoy themselves, and adults to seemed to genuinely like the world of magic and wonderment. The dialogues are awesome, but I bet they are right from the book. The actors playing the Pevensie kids haven’t improved much over the previous films. But casting Will Poulter in the role of Eustace Srubb is one of the better decisions. He does a brilliant job of being a whiny, unbelieving and obnoxious cousin. His encounters with Reepcheep, the talking mouse, give many a laugh with excellent timing and dialogues. Ben Barnes plays a good Caspian portraying his buried doubts of ability.The action sequences are really good, especially considering that the target audience is school kids. Though the emotional scenes were a bit lengthy and boring, I am sure kids will love them. The special effects are superb too. The talking mouse Reepcheep, the invisible castle and Monocolis (one legged dwarfs) are awesomely made. Things like showing fog issuing from invisible and magical mirrors' mouths were great ideas to make the film believable yet magical. That Aslan looks old and less majestic, was a major disappointment for me because I love his character the most. Thankfully, his reverberating voice is as captivating as ever before. And they tried their best to make the scariest serpent and the most beautiful dragon. 
Though the climax feels like a mix of Pirates of the Caribbean and Harry Potter, it has its own charm. 3D sure helps, though they could have made it much scarier and more appealing. With a little more maturity in the story than the previous films shows, direction takes the cake for this film. Like any other book adopted into a film, this one has loopholes too. So if you have read the novels, you surely not going to like the way they twist the story to their convenience. But the visual treat compensates for it. In any case, this film is a good watch for kids as well as adults, - 3D or 2D.

152,250,250,250,250,Chungking Express,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/chungking-express-review/,,,,4.133333333,"Watching Chungking Express is like sifting through a photo album on a rainy evening. The steam from your coffee mug adds a misty feel to the pictures of the city, which are tourist-y. Every now and then, the monotony of those pictures is broken by abstract Picasso-like imagery. Nothing holds, or stays still in the film, but yet it’s not a fast paced story. Wong Kai Wai’s Chungking Express is magical and yet reveals lump-in-your-throat type surprises. ","Love manifests itself in many ways; it’s a visual and written cliché. All you need is perception and memories, and you can see the cliché unfold beautifully. In Chungking Express, the Wong-Kar Wai manifestation of love however, intoxicates you, makes you dance around in a circles of extremities – with crimson red passion on one side and navy blue, bordering grey loneliness on the other.Chungking Express is about love lost, the city life with all its colours, humanity and its feats - all while it slowly deconstructs every little thought bubble that pops in your head through the film. The film is divided into two stories, about 2 cops and their bitter experiences with love. Cop 223 is hung over his girlfriend, May who left him on April fool’s day. He buys a can of pineapples with a month long expiry, hoping she’ll be back before the expiry date. Cop 663 is also dealing with an intense breakup with his airhostess girlfriend. He starts to find routine comfort in a midnight café amidst a waitress called Faye, while she breaks into his apartment to cure her fascination for his passiveness. Nothing explicit is common between both the stories – they are accounts of two random cops in a fast-moving city. A city  that’s not going to stop to cure broken hearts. The city incorporates colours, disconnected photography and pop-culture (the waitress is addicted to ‘California Dreamin’ by The Mamas and The Papas, a splash of blonde wigs and dark glasses and Dinah Washington played in the background of the second story)You won’t see love spelt outright in the film, it’s in the pace with which the parallel stories secretly interact, it’s in the silence of the two protagonists and their kaleidoscopic experiences, and most of all it’s in the visual treatment of the film. With many billboard signs and slogans, pop-music as background score, an amalgamation of realistic and romantic cinematography and conflicting colours, the movie makes you feel you’re watching a Godard film, but before you can hold that thought – the visuals shift between film/video to pixilated images. The criterion collection DVD of Chungking Express comes with a commentary by British film-writer Tony Rayns – who offers a unique analysis of the film. It helps, because it might take you multiple viewing to realize that something is happening in the film. One watch down, all you remember are shots, colours and an intoxicated, jazzy hangover of the film. The kind that makes you want to rewind and re-watch scenes.

153,251,251,251,251,Cigarette Ki Tarah,Not rated by wogma,10 Critic Reviews 0.3/5.0,/movie/chungking-express-review/,0.3/5.0,,,4.55,"Watching Chungking Express is like sifting through a photo album on a rainy evening. The steam from your coffee mug adds a misty feel to the pictures of the city, which are tourist-y. Every now and then, the monotony of those pictures is broken by abstract Picasso-like imagery. Nothing holds, or stays still in the film, but yet it’s not a fast paced story. Wong Kai Wai’s Chungking Express is magical and yet reveals lump-in-your-throat type surprises. ","Love manifests itself in many ways; it’s a visual and written cliché. All you need is perception and memories, and you can see the cliché unfold beautifully. In Chungking Express, the Wong-Kar Wai manifestation of love however, intoxicates you, makes you dance around in a circles of extremities – with crimson red passion on one side and navy blue, bordering grey loneliness on the other.Chungking Express is about love lost, the city life with all its colours, humanity and its feats - all while it slowly deconstructs every little thought bubble that pops in your head through the film. The film is divided into two stories, about 2 cops and their bitter experiences with love. Cop 223 is hung over his girlfriend, May who left him on April fool’s day. He buys a can of pineapples with a month long expiry, hoping she’ll be back before the expiry date. Cop 663 is also dealing with an intense breakup with his airhostess girlfriend. He starts to find routine comfort in a midnight café amidst a waitress called Faye, while she breaks into his apartment to cure her fascination for his passiveness. Nothing explicit is common between both the stories – they are accounts of two random cops in a fast-moving city. A city  that’s not going to stop to cure broken hearts. The city incorporates colours, disconnected photography and pop-culture (the waitress is addicted to ‘California Dreamin’ by The Mamas and The Papas, a splash of blonde wigs and dark glasses and Dinah Washington played in the background of the second story)You won’t see love spelt outright in the film, it’s in the pace with which the parallel stories secretly interact, it’s in the silence of the two protagonists and their kaleidoscopic experiences, and most of all it’s in the visual treatment of the film. With many billboard signs and slogans, pop-music as background score, an amalgamation of realistic and romantic cinematography and conflicting colours, the movie makes you feel you’re watching a Godard film, but before you can hold that thought – the visuals shift between film/video to pixilated images. The criterion collection DVD of Chungking Express comes with a commentary by British film-writer Tony Rayns – who offers a unique analysis of the film. It helps, because it might take you multiple viewing to realize that something is happening in the film. One watch down, all you remember are shots, colours and an intoxicated, jazzy hangover of the film. The kind that makes you want to rewind and re-watch scenes.

But, the nice stuff stops there. I'm not at all passing a moral judgement on the characters' lack of character. It's just the loud and annoying way in which things play out that gets on your nerves after about an hour. And there is another 1.5 hours to go.","It is difficult to shake of the thick legacy of mill-worker-era films like Roti, Kapda, aur Makaan and Namak Haraam. And I'm sure there were more films on the issue that I haven't seen. And despite having seen all of this at least 20 years ago, ironically, it was refreshing to see the concept on screen. But that's where the freshness ends. It then turns into regular Manjrekar-ization of the topic. Loud, louder, and if you haven't heard it yet, loudest.The degradation of the Indian - read Bombayite - moral fiber to barely threadbare in the early 80s - be it sex or violence. The cause being identified as globalization and commercialization of semi-public property. The collateral damage due to the transition from semi-socialism to capitalism - the entire value system. All this heavy stuff is crammed in 2.5 hours. You'd think that that would make the film fast-paced and interesting. Unfortunately, it's all done in a way that doesn't touch you. It can be argued that the film might make a better impact on people who were actually affected by the mill-worker strikes, but what's a film that doesn't make you identify with characters that are unlike you?I completely appreciate the gray shades given to each and every character. But their haphazard behavior and choppy way of moving from one sub-plot to another or one issue to another, is extremely exasperating. Not to mention, it completely highlights the confusion the makers seem to struggle with. What deserves more weightage? The mill-workers' political situation? The impact it has on the spouses and the children of these mill-workers? The demonization of corporatization? What? What?? What???And then, you top it off with some loud acting, blaring sound design and shocking visuals. A sample of the last is situation of poverty and desperation reaching such an insane level that violence makes the youth, the nation's tomorrow, cannibals and masturbators-in-public. I understand the frustration that Mahesh Manjrekar tries to convey, not only in this film, but all his films. And I value the courage it takes to follow through on showcasing the exasperation he feels or rather he thinks the audience ought to feel. But such on-the-face, over-the-top execution makes me wait for the interval after the first half hour of the film and for the end-credits, post-interval.Sure, the generation born to (and after) the generation which struggled for the basics - food, shelter, and clothes - needs to be sensitized and made aware of the cost at which the luxuries to them have come. But, this one only succeeded in repulsing me from the subject.

Given the texture of the film, you know they are going to suffer. A lot. Before they get any respite, if at all. Now, we know where this is going and so have to heavily bank on the details of how this comes about and the performances. One delivers, the other not that much. There's no better way to put this - the difficulties in the lives of Deepak (Rajkummar Rao) and Rakhee (Patralekha) come to easily. Yes, given their value system they are asked to do pretty horrendous things. But, you don't see their resistance. You don't see them looking for better options before stooping low (by their own standards). This is where I lost interest in the film, despite liking the pace at which things were playing out. Then I wondered if it was because Deepak and Rakhee were made out to be generalizations of all immigrants into a city. While some times such stereotypes work, at most times the cliché has to work harder to create an impact. And to that end, Citylights was doing nothing. Every once in a while, it becomes the story of this particular person, Deepak. And at those times, it does engage, but quickly it slips back into being this sad story of how people from outside the city are so gullible and the city is out to get them.I am not going to go into the argument of whether or not all non-city-dwellers are more or less unaware of how the world works and that all city-dwellers are out their to dupe the former. For I believe at some level, we all want to believe that nothing bad will happen to us and when we smarten up it changes to, I'm smarter now, so nothing bad will happen to me. Similarly, all of us will agree to cheat when push comes to shove. The only problem is that you are not convinced that push has come to shove in Deepak and Rakhee's case. The only thing keeping the film interesting then is the performances. Rajkummar Rao and Manav Kaul are thoroughly engaging, especially Manav Kaul. It might have to do more with his character too. The shade of grey, his frustration and reasons for doing what he does are all interesting. Patralekha on the other hand does well with what she's asked to do. How I wish her character had better depth for it to explore her acting skills. Then you have the background score and the songs. They both hinder instead of help. Somehow, the film's ambience isn't congruous with the music. The music by itself is pretty mediocre too. They sounded more like they belonged to a Bhatt film while they were in a setting that wanted to be in the Aamir zone.That I think is the bane. Citylights tries to be two things at the same time for some things that cannot go together. True it keeps the setting real and the performances support that theme. But, other than that, it doesn't engage. Just because a film is morose and grim, it doesn't qualify as one that reaches out to you deep within. It is not good enough to have realistic setting and performances. The story has to make you believe too. That is what Citylights misses.

This one is no different.","“This one will be another Duniyadari. I am telling you,” smirked a man sitting next to me at his friend. As the screening of Classmates began, I couldn’t stop myself linking both the films at more than a few instances. I on’t know if that guy was some astrologer or was well-versed with the films of similar genre (I smell the latter). Such a prediction may hardly surprise you; given the kind of films our industry is famous for making. Well, in a broad sense, Classmates is no way a Duniyadari spin-off; but comparisons are highly inevitable.Classmates is an official remake of 2006 Malayalam film of the same name. The original is said to be a trendsetter in the Kerala film industry. If its success can be replicated in Tamil and Telugu as well, then why not in Marathi? Remakes of films from the south are all the rage in Bollywood and Marathi industry also seems to be following suit. Not that I’m anti remakes; eventually all that matters is entertainment. But not at the cost of logic. The latest remake is filled with all possible, formulaic elements that are considered as the principle foundations of college-life films. This leaves you neither surprised nor wanting for more.A group of college students who stay out of class more than in, spends a large amount of time cracking jokes, dropping one-liners, riding bikes, dancing to the tunes of lip-synching songs or scuffling around. Enter romance, undying friendships and, most prominently, and college elections. This dramatic time actually unfolds through the old memories of these students (now ex) gathered at their reunion. Having seen multitude films set in the 90s (or even prior to that); I don’t want to pick apart these ingredients, no matter how superficial they seem to me.As the narrative jumps between past and present, the only visible difference is makeup and costumes. The visual treatment of the past story is so fancy that it barely reminisces the 90s era. The production sorely misses the point here. The film largely deals with political disputes interlaced with suspense and plentiful action. Some of its moments are blatant, while some (the one right before the interval or the one that leads to climax) are simply masterstroke. You know where the story is headed to. Yet; Classmates gets increasingly intriguing post interval, one reason being correctly placed conflicts.On the contrary, the sequence – that interrelates the past and present – casting doubts on intentions - the way it is written or even executed makes the film appear as a murder thriller. Nothing wrong about that as long as it gels well with the storytelling. But if the whole aim is to make a feel-good film, then why forcibly inject things just to create suspense? This one is totally needless and is a lame effort. Unnecessarily stretched out runtime is a big disappointment too. A cleverly edited first half could have surely saved a few yawns.I must say, Ankush Chaudhari is a master performer. He once essays the role of a college heartthrob and then seamlessly gets into the character of a lost man. Though his character is another repetition of Duniyadari, he impresses throughout. Classmates, riddled with several narrative flaws, is actually made worth watching by its talented cast (look out for Pallavi Patil and Siddharth Chandekar).As I write this piece, the one thing that refuses to leave my mind is the film’s background score. It reminds me of my personal favorite, The Dark Knight-themed score.In Classmates, Ankush’s character addresses not-so-good things as ‘small aahe (it’s small)’ or quality as ‘darja’. His delivery makes these words sound really intense. Ironically, all the efforts fed away in the end and the picture turns as dull as it could get. Small aahe!

157,255,255,255,255,Closer,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/closer-review/,,,,4.033333333,"Damien Rice’s ‘Blower’s Daughter’, featured in the background score and almost an anthem of the film, has a beautiful line that describes Closer in the best possible manner. “And so it is, just like you said it would be, Life goes easy on me, Most of the time. And so it is, the shorter story, No love, no glory, No hero in her sky. I can't take my eyes off of you”. It’s often the simplest emotions that lead to our actions, or desire. Closer explores the trajectory and fate of those very actions and desires. ","When I first watched Mike Nichol’s Closer, I had to remind myself that he also directed film likes The Graduate and Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf. While the former is a rather one-dimensional narrative about a relationship between a younger man and an older woman, the latter plays around with the idea of complex relationships involving two couples, breaking all moulds of structure. To me, that stood as the perfect backdrop for Closer, which also explores the complex and inter-mingling relationship of two couples. And yet somehow, Closer is also trying to break your security blanket of simplicity, as a viewer. Alice (Natalie Portman) and Dan (Jude Law) meet on the street in a bizarre manner, owing to instant attraction. A year later, Dan has moved from writing obituaries to writing a book on Alice, who is a stripper and as you grow with her, you realize she’s a vulnerable, complex individual with a little too much love for drama. He then meets Anna, a photographer, (Julia Roberts) while publicizing his book, as she photographs his portfolio. In a more sinister setting, Dan pretends to be Anna in a lewd chat room and lures Larry (Clive Owen), who’s a dermatologist, to meet her in an aquarium. Each individual character explores their personal relationship with one another, with chance meetings, forced interactions and sexual relationships that aren’t left to any explanations. Why, you ask? Because Closer doesn’t claim to explore labels; like monogamy, morality and suchlike. While it’s a film about complexity in human relationships, the question it is trying to ask is not, ""Why would Dan sleep with Anna when he is with Alice?"" but ""On what basis do we chart our liaisons?""It becomes extremely difficult to move beyond characterization in Closer. The film is shot beautifully, where tight shots and angles are incorporated to suit the mood of the scene. You move through dislike and fondness for all four characters while they are being portrayed – visually and emotionally. While Portman as Alice is naïve and childishly thespian, Anna is quite the opposite with her inability to express the inner recesses of her mind. Julia Roberts is brilliantly cast for a silently volatile role like Anna. Dan catches on to the mysterious charm that Anna exudes, while she chooses to express bits and pieces of it with both Larry and him. Larry is like a typical savior. He moves between being a security blanket and a possessive maniac. It becomes a gripping visual when we see him (as with the other characters) switch between his roles. Closer is a character driven film. My personal favorite character remains Alice. She’s young, and brings with her every baggage that a young person carries: Naiveté that translates into harsh judgments and impulsive decisions. Impulsiveness that translates into disregard for anything logical – doing what one pleases, even if it means taking the more hurtful path, just because you want to. The beauty of the film, then lies in its ability to move back and forth, in and out of every character’s motivations. While there’s no plot to boast of, the background score is perfectly layered and deep, to suit the mood of the film. While the soundtrack of the film is largely minimal and soothing, using artists like Jem, Lisa Hannigan and The Smiths, ‘The Blower’s Daughter’ with its signature line, “I can’t take my eyes off of you” becomes like an anthem for the movie. Because at the end of it, every connection, every bit of complexity, every infidel association and every emotion is derived from a basic bottom-line of instinct. It’s as simple and strong as not being able to take your eyes off someone – whether you want to or not.The DVD of Closer has an interview with the director Mike Nichols, while he talks about his motivations to adapt the film from a 1997 play of the same name. It also includes a theatrical trailer and a music video of Damien Rice’s ‘Blower’s Daughter’. In a way, Closer is a lot like Alice’s personal character. It’s a film just because – no reasons are given for the decisions and actions that the characters take. No analyses about what their actions define about themselves, because life isn’t that easy. It’s an impulsive film, one that endorses multiplicity in many forms – relationships, thought and structure. But with a disclaimer.

Writing that makes you care about the characters they play. ","You have settled down in life, your kids are doing well for themselves. You are all set to enjoy life carefree. And boom life hits you. You are asked to come-of-age all over again. Club 60 might come across as a film of one such man, but it also goes on to tell you that he, his troubles and tragedy not that unique after all. Just like when you look around, you see that like you, everyone has problems. They just choose to deal with them differently. There is something very delightful about films that take on topics related to the elderly - not the glamorous Baghbaan way, but more like the Listen Amaya way. Especially, when you have charming actors like Farouque Shaikh and Sarika play the lead roles. Not only do they make the characters believable, but they make you care for them. And even if that should be the norm, we know it is very difficult to come by in Hindi films. Yet again, Sarika does that one scene which completely bowls you over and brings a lump to the throat and more. I now look forward to every film that Farouque Shaikh chooses to do, because the films by themselves are interesting. And as unfair as it may sound, he could sleepwalk through his role as Taariq in Club 60. Raghuveer Yadav plays his Munna bhai with great finesses. While playing a sleazeball must be one of the easiest in an actor's range of talent, playing a sleazeball who convinces you that he is good-naturedly so right from the first scene has to be a rare one. And it doesn't come across as inconsistent at all.And yet these performances are not the best thing about Club 60. A pleasant surprise are Sharat Saxena and Tinu Anand. The characters they play could easily have become caricatures. Yet, that is avoided with finesse and you see them go through their highs and lows with unexpected grace and dignity. So much so that a fine performance by Satish Shah is side-lined. Where Club 60 suffers then - other than the low-budget-induced-production-values - is the writing. It gets a little repetitive, and the film stretches out a good 15-20 minutes too long. The situations created for each of the characters becomes a tad stereotypical. Even so, you cannot help but want to know more about them because you've grown to care for them. They do remind you of your parents and their group of friends. Alas, the climax is a little too dramatized and drastic for the tone the film maintains through the first two hours. For many, the film might be a good enough on TV watch, but I just couldn't help giving it an extra nudge for the heart it takes to make a film like this. One which takes an understanding, even if a slightly patronizing, look at the generation that's over the hill.

Light and breezy it is good while it lasts. Cocktail lasts till a little after interval when it starts moping and mulling. A promising start meets a generic, uninteresting end.","I love well-made romantic comedies, I am sucked in by many a romantic tragedies. But a comedy that becomes a tragedy and a fresh comedy that turns into a clichéd tragedy, it's just disappointing. True, I didn't think Cocktail would be great. In that sense it delivers as promised. But, the problem is it gives hope in the beginning and then just falters and falls in a great thump towards the end. The good thing though is that Cocktail never lets go of the emotions it has stirred - within the characters and  thus what we feel for the audience too. If only, they had let go of the generic love triangle towards the end.You are introduced to abla naari (damsel in distress) Meera (Diana Penty), self-acclaimed cheesy, flirtoholic Gautam (Saif Ali Khan) and one who could pass off as alcoholic, Veronica (Deepika Padukone). Veronica, as if to further define her character is brought in with a bang, especially compared to  the background music free introductory tracks of Meera and Gautam. The pace at which this happens is not in the regular cut-chop-done mode either. It eases you in and you like your stay with them as the chemistry brews with fun and freshness and makes them into much-needed therapists for each other. Unfortunately, as the film progresses you see that very little depth is accorded to Gautam as he soon starts coming across as a shuttlecock in a long rally. In contrast, the female protagonists seem to be holding their own with their dilemmas and yet they plummet to the regular and predictable outcome which most lady leads are destined to – wanting nothing else but to be with their man. Yep, maybe love indeed makes girls behave like girls – forlorn, beyond logic and turns the finest of them into stereotypical whiners. Yet, I enjoyed the supposed nastiness attached to Veronica much like her namesake from the Archie comics (except the protagonist here seems to be more Reggie than Archie). She carries a palpable loneliness within her and drowns it in the chaos of loud pubs. Deepika Padukone does great in carrying the various emotions without it being necessarily spoon-fed.  Even in a scene where she looks out-of-sorts while trying to seduce her man, you see what she's getting at right after. Similarly, Diana Penty, the demure desi in town puts forth her dilemma, her suppressed angst against how her life has shaped up with great warmth. But when these smart, independent women fall head-over-heels in love with an obnoxious over-the-top charmer you only wonder why two beautiful characters are being drowned in inanity. Saif Ali Khan looks at least five years older than he is made out to be. That besides he goes overboard with Gautam's cockiness. As intentional as it might have been, it doesn't make me root for Gautam and his dilemma comes across as silly and immature. It's not that women like 'these' can't fall in love with men like 'that' - it's love, anything can happen - but why I am being asked to give the writers or their characters benefit of doubt? Why can't I see it? I like both women enough that I want both of them to get what they want, but I don't see why they want what they want. Then come the many other quibbles. Not resorting to needless backstory is one thing, and a vivacious Veronica having no friends before Meera and Gautam is quite another. These are the things that distract from the believability of the story. On the other hand, the backstory offered by way of Gautam's mom (Dimple Kapadia) and uncle (Boman Irani) make you wish it wasn't offered. Their characters are mere pawns in making the story make that twist that turns it into ever-so-blah. Not to mention the two awesome actors are made to play loud, meatless characters. Similarly, Meera's husband's (Randeep Hooda) track is also avoidable thus saving a lot of precious screentime. It is all left to the threesome then to pull it through. They do manage for a bit but what can actors do once the script has fallen prey to standard terms and conditions. No experimentation, no risks, no gut.

162,260,260,260,260,[The] Collection,Switch channels if it's on cable,wogma review,/movie/collection-review/,,,,3.933333333,"Those who go queasy at the sight of torture, blood and gore must stay away from Marcus Dunstan’s The Collection. That is pretty much all there is to the film. And those of you who do not go queasy at the sight of gore, you must stay away from this film even more, because the only people who are truly subjected to torture in this horror/torture flick is the audience. As mindless as slapstick films named after the progeny of turbaned folk, but far more difficult to sit through, The Collection is as avoidable as it can get.","I like to look to draw positives from every movie; the positive I drew from The Collection is that at least the worst film I’ve watched on the big screen this year isn’t an Indian one. The Collection, by sheer virtue of its genre, caters to a very niche audience. After all, not many people like to spend an hour and a half watching body parts being dismembered, human beings being tortured with sharp steel jaws and spikes, hairy tarantulas walking over a girl’s face and the likes. Such people should any way stay away from films like this and others of its ilk. But films of this genre do have their hardcore, loyal audience. Though I don’t particularly belong to that category, I do enjoy blood-and-gore on screen, when done well. In fact, I actually liked the first installment of Saw, a 'seminal' film in this genre, if I could say such a thing. The further films in the series went from bad to worse, but that is another story. Or Eli Roth’s Hostel for that matter, another film that I quite enjoyed for its B-movie indulgence. From Dusk Till Dawn is another film that comes to mind - though it was about vampires, it was equally gory.Here though, I doubt even hardcore loyalists will draw anything at all from The Collection. A random assortment of torture and murder scenes with no regard for space, time or logic, this is the kind of film that makes 82 minutes seem like eternity and then some. And it isn’t just the wanton castration of human bodies that is the problem. The excruciating non-imaginativeness of every scene and situation without even the semblance of an effort to inject the slightest credibility into the treatment makes you almost wish that someone drove a rusty steel spike through you instead. At least your own torture would end then.All films, good or bad, have a ‘story’. This one does too; a particularly silly one. Through a montage of newscasts, we are introduced to the fact that a violent serial killer is on the prowl – one who kills in numbers at random locations and then abducts people from the scene, their whereabouts completely unknown after that. Inevitably, he abducts a girl, which then sets off a chain of events that lead to a group of men and women trapped in an abandoned hotel that is actually a maze-like deathly lair belonging to our masked serial killer. His barbaric instruments of torture and death are all over; tripping over a tiny thread can cause god-knows-what horrific contraption to skewer you.It doesn’t help that firstly the writers and director, and then the cast, take themselves way too seriously. Had they chosen to go Robert Rodriguez on this film, it could actually have made for a hangout movie; where friends can laugh and snigger while the people involved with the film laugh at themselves as well. No such luck here. Everyone clearly believed that a masterpiece was in the making. The cast is full of familiar faces, but not familiar names; they are all bit actors who’ve made fleeting appearances in big movies. On1 some level I actually felt bad for them. They clearly were under the impression that this is their big break to stardom, which it is most certainly not. The Collection is supposedly a sequel to a cult horror film, The Collector, which was also directed by Marcus Dunstan, director and co-writer of this film. I haven’t watched that, and if it is anything like this, I’m glad I haven’t, because The Collection scrapes the bottom of the cinematic barrel.

163,261,261,261,261,Conan The Barbarian,Switch channels if it's on cable,wogma review,/movie/conan-barbarian-review/,,,,3.933333333,"According to the makers of Conan The Barbarian - Barbarism equals to screaming, mindless splatter of blood and gore (Dexter stay away, not worth your time) and no sense of story or characters. To top it all, the film is in 3D. If you still want to endure the torture of this mindless war film, please find a 2D version. Better more, rent the Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 1982 version of the film. Please. ","I can tell you who will love Conan The Barbarian - Bulky, gym-going, Hayabusa driving, testosterone sweating, alpha males whose worst fear is being called Gay. They’re afraid to cry, or wear pink, but anything that spells b-l-o-o-d and involves manly barking, is FUN! And keeping with the cliché, Conan The Barbarian is all blood, sweat and low-baritone action. Not to mention, mindless, plotless and painful.Michael Nispel’s Conan the Barbarian, which was brought to attention by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1982 version of the film, follows pretty much the same plot (?). Conan (Jason Momoa) is born amidst war, and grows to be a brutal, fearsome warrior. He stands out among his peers because of his mastery with swords. When he returns to his village, he finds it under the hostage of the powerful warlord Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang). The film tracks Conan as he fights for the dignity of his village – rather barbarically. When the film opens with a gruesome scene, at that moment you think it could be a thrilling film – coupled with a story and a reason for us to take a journey through all the fights, blood and tears. However, our dear friend Conan here seems to jump from one fight to another without joining any dots. The entire “story” is told to us in a hurried first 10 mins, following which it’s “Dishum!” – 20 dead, a dance of swords and rivers of blood. Sadly, there’s nothing epic or legendary about it. Jason Momoa cannot be taken seriously. Although some credit could be given to costume/make-up, because he certainly looks the part – but someone needs to sit him down and explain to him that screaming his guts out doesn’t make him a barbarian (most of the fights are graphically enhanced anyway. No points to acting, if at all) I have friends who have read the Marvel comics of Conan the Barbarian who tell me that the comics are much more detailed, enchanting and grand. They give you a sense of journey, of a real fight. Schwarzenegger’s version of the film made him an international star, because the 1982 film had convincing screen savagery, and set a benchmark for raw, rugged action.Conan The Barbarian in 3D however, is repetitive and just boring. It’s the same sequences being rotated in this washing machine of a film. A set of bloody, gory war scenes and sinister, half-smirking villains who love evilness just makes for a very frustrating 2 hours. It seems like the makers learnt nothing from their predecessors. The 1982 version has a grand background score, earning immense popularity, given by Basil Poledouris. This Conan The Barbarian – has screams.  Please save yourself from the film. And from this wallet-tearing trend of 3D that is basically another head-ache inducing mechanism. You’d be much better off watching some soap-opera re-run on TV.

164,262,262,262,262,[The] Conjuring,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/conjuring-review/,,4/5.0,,3.6,"James Wan’s latest spookfest, The Conjuring, makes for a decent big screen watch because of some genuine thrills. The film makes will have you hooked and rooting for the characters; if you’re the kind that scares easy, I assure you you’ll have some good fun.","I was slightly disappointed that the DVD of The Conjuring (a single DVD pack, as usual), had only one special feature - a roughly 8-minute segment titled 'Scaring the @$*% Out of You'. Pretty much a 'making of', the video does give a glimpse into director James Wan's style of work, but it leaves you wanting more. Considering how much effort went into the look, feel and the design of the scares, a more comprehensive featurette would have been wonderful. Also, the DVD doesn't have audio or subtitle options in any Indian languages, which is a pity.It is left to the movie, then, to make the DVD of the film a collectible. The Conjuring, for me, is one of best horror films in recent times, and that becomes even more apparent while watching it for the second time on DVD. Despite knowing exactly how the film is going to pan out, it still manages to involve you in the period, the location and the characters. James Wan is an exciting director to watch out for in the horror space, because he knows how to use familiar tropes well, and he really paces the horror elements well. The Conjuring is must-own for fans of horror!A film that announces, right at the start, that it is based on a true story, always tends to make you shift in your seat with some anticipation. And when that film delves into the supernatural, you are bound to be even more intrigued. One of the big tragedies of the life that I have spent almost wholly sucked into the world of cinema is the fact that the one genre which hasn’t been able to penetrate deep into the corners of my soul is horror. I’ve never been terrified while watching a horror film, which also means that I’m usually the wrong person to be doling out opinions on whether a film is scary or not. Horror, for me, is an extension of the thriller genre, and that’s usually how I judge every horror film. The Conjuring, then, draws you into a dark world, hooks you and lets you go feeling quite, well, thrilled.Based on a hitherto untold true story from the case files of famous paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren – who were also involved in investigating The Amityville Haunting, amongst other ‘famous’ real life supernatural stories – The Conjuring sets itself up with a familiar premise – a family of seven (a couple with five daughters) moves into a new house and begins to experience strange occurrences almost as soon as they do. The Warrens are brought in to look into the matter, even as the haunting begins to assume proportions they hadn’t experienced so far in their professional lives investigating paranormal phenomena.In the hands of genre expert James Wan – Saw and Insidious are the two films of his I’ve watched earlier, and both are good fun – The Conjuring doffs its hat to The Exorcist, but uses silences and pauses as its greatest weapons in attempting to scare the audience. It uses minimal music but familiar startling visual tropes that keep building up in frequency and intensity through the film. What I really liked about The Conjuring is the fact that it has a nice graph – a slow build up, a gripping middle and a conclusive, definite resolution. Also, the film is set in the early 70s, and it manages to create a nice feel for the time period with its grainy look, colour tone and production design. What also sets The Conjuring slightly apart from most other recent horror films is that it makes you invest emotionally in not just the family that is being haunted, but also with those who are called in to help the family in their distress – you root for both parties equally – because there is always the unshakable feeling that both parties have something at stake.However, it is Vera Farmiga, who plays Lorraine Warren, that’s easily the best thing about the film. Blessed with the most charming, pleasing and warm screen presence, she is almost like the shining beacon of hope in The Conjuring. To borrow a term from the Harry Potter series, she’s almost like a Patronus – a guardian against negativity and evil. Patrick Wilson, a frequent star in James Wan’s films, creates a credible aura of support as Ed Warren. Mostly though, The Conjuring is the kind of film that works because of the ambiance it creates in the cinema hall. Barring those who attempt to mask their fear by indulging in loud commentary and lame humour, the film unites the audience in its gasping reactions to what is being witnessed. For that experience alone, The Conjuring is best watched in the theatre, in the last possible night show that you can find. Go for it then; I envy you for the fun you’ll have, while I deal with my own ironical curse of non-scary horror.

165,263,263,263,263,Contract,Watch when on TV/online,wogma reviewNotepadPreview16 Critic Reviews 1.1/5.0 3 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/contract-review/,1.1/5.0,4/5.0,,3.3,"In broad terms, it's a 'been there seen that' underworld movie. The regular Ram Gopal Varma style of covering gangsters and their lives. But it has a certain rugged feel about it and the sub-plots and side characters are fresh which can make a good DVD watch.","The ""Underworld meets terrorism"" tagline clearly seems like a marketing ploy to get the initial crowds into the theater. Because Contract has as much to do with terrorism as say, RGV ki Aag has to do with Sholay. (I promise this is the last time I mention RGV ki aag when I review a RGV product!) Having said that, if you're game for another vengeance-ridden protagonist who has a ""shoot at sight"" order from the director, this one is it. The story is fairly well-written and the characters are border-line caricatures but non-standard enough to grab your attention. First things first, as usual, I couldn’t handle the random ""see my nostril hair"" super-tight close-ups. My complaint like always, is more against the randomness than with the actual close-ups. I must say though, that there are some scenes which could have easily used the standard over-the-shoulder editing, but instead, close-ups or mid-shots were interspersed with shots of both characters in the same frame. I'm not saying this is path-breaking, just saying it’s a breath of fresh air from the extensive ""blackhead coverage"".Of all the departments of film-making, in Contract, the casting fascinated me the most. Many movies make me wonder about some of the decisions. What went through the writer's head? What was the interaction between the cinematographer and the director in this shot? Contractmade me very, very curious about the casting process. What must have the auditions been like? How did they pick the actor to absolutely suit the character? So many of them, new faces and none of them looked out of place. Now, the importance of the character in the whole scheme of things can be debated, but the actors were chosen well and almost each one did justice to the role given to them. Some of the characters were over-ridden by stereotypes set apart for them. For example, the main lead played by Adhvik Mahajan (Aman) had to have a wooden, sullen look just because no one thought of another way of portraying a peace-loving guy who has been hardened by the vagaries of life. Not to mention Adhvik's voice which is a complete turn down.For instance, Prasad Purandhare looked sinister in his opening shots as the cop trying to convince Aman into joining his ploy to get to the terrorists. So much so that I wouldn't have been surprised if he was behind the havoc in Aman's life in the first place. The very sight of loud characters get my nerves crawling up my skin. So, I think it’s a huge compliment when I manage to not only tolerate them through the movie, but in fact enjoy their company for the first couple of times they are on screen. While credit does go to Upendra Limaye and Amruta Subhash who played the loud Goonga and his louder wife, it is equally shared by the way the characters are written and the things they are made to do even though they are not the focus of the camera. There is a certain rawness about the way things are handled in writing the sub-plots too. I'm sure you have always wondered why the protagonist, who is out to kill the villain, chatted him up first? You'll know why when you watch Contract. Because any other way and it looks too easy to be true. But, they deserve points for trying something different. While they let us see on screen is gritty when it needs to be, what we don't see but is implied has an effect on your nerves too. Then it maybe, the image of a wife-beater you create in your head or how you are blind to the visuals when the twist in the lyrics of an innocent rhyme, 'twinkle twinkle', hits you. The latter works more so because it is a child's voice has been used. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about creativity in the writing of the broader plot. It is a decent watch but ultimately there's nothing new in the story. Ram Gopal Varma on his blog mentions, I guess that's why, he's just touched upon the terrorism angle that's claimed to pervade into the underworld. After all there are 97 movies to go, what's the rush?

All that sounds ambitious is not awe-inspiring. All that seems unconventional is not path-breaking. And all is not Chaitanya Tamhane’s Court. Brimming with non-conformist aesthetics and peculiar treatment, the film exudes a sublime illustration of cinematic flamboyance. The painstakingly-penned script brilliantly musters varied narrative elements to craft a terrific piece of art. Realistic to the core, Tamhane’s visual storytelling transcend linguistic barriers with a dramatic ease. Perhaps not everyone's cup of tea, it’s a welcome change nonetheless. While being an eye-opener for our flawed society, it could also be a trend-setter for audiences.A folk singer fearlessly indulges in radical activism against political wrongdoings. A defence lawyer, living a prosperous life, selflessly rallies behind those arrested unlawfully. A public prosecutor dutifully pursues the job to her without worrying about the legitimacy of a case. A judge obliviously relies on obsolete laws rather than the spirit of the law. A widow hopes to earn her living rather than accept charity. This is the world of Court, where the anguish of its characters easily shatters one’s thoughts of an ideal world. The case of this activist poet, allegedly charged for abetting the widow’s husband to commit suicide, is what binds this world together.Court outdoes routine courtroom dramas to the last bits because of its radical storytelling. Instead of taking sides or being an interpreter, it chooses to be a distant observer. The simplicity with which Tamhane builds his characters and their backstories without uttering a single direct word is quite an achievement. Letting their agonies do all the talking, he paints a stark picture of the widening inequality and the worrying state of freedom of speech. He refuses to be preachy even while laying out the tiniest details – be it the Dalit killings, political propaganda or the plight of blue-collar workers.Since our judgment hinges on cultural and social milieu, Tamhane takes you away from the courtroom to their personal lives. Appearing inconsequential on the face, the lifestyles offer great insight and prove to be a master stroke element in  the plot. A pragmatic approach in unfolding the story stays true to the subject and pays off, despite virtually non-existent drama. The film uses courtroom as a means to lay bare the flaws of Indian society at large rather than ridiculing judicial system alone.With authentic production design, prolonged shots and no background score; Tamhane not only presents you the dull judicial proceedings, but also makes you feel the drabness. Each camera angle and its movement is well designed and keeps you involved as an observer. A striking balance between visual treatment and colour palette harmonizes the realism, making the film powerful. The repetitive use of bluish hues, even in warmer tones, creates an air of sombreness and monotony – which is perfectly in consonance with its theme. The lighting conditions dip from bright to dark as the trial unfolds, depicting its gloominess. When was the last time an Indian film excelled so well in visual storytelling? Bravo!Vira Sathidar portrays Narayan Kamble impeccably.It’s hard to believe he is a non-actor, as are all other characters. Sambhaji Bhagat’s invigorating vocals bring a huge difference to his act. I am not sure if radical songs can instigate someone to commit suicide. But they certainly have enough vigour to make you adore them, just as they add to the film's advantage.Court effortlessly manifests that hardcore realism can serve as an engaging experience. No wonder it is indisputably the best debut of the times and Tamhane gets everything right, something that is sure to leave many of his contemporaries as well as seasoned filmmakers in awe.

All that sounds ambitious is not awe-inspiring. All that seems unconventional is not path-breaking. And all is not Chaitanya Tamhane’s Court. Brimming with non-conformist aesthetics and peculiar treatment, the film exudes a sublime illustration of cinematic flamboyance. The painstakingly-penned script brilliantly musters varied narrative elements to craft a terrific piece of art. Realistic to the core, Tamhane’s visual storytelling transcend linguistic barriers with a dramatic ease. Perhaps not everyone's cup of tea, it’s a welcome change nonetheless. While being an eye-opener for our flawed society, it could also be a trend-setter for audiences.A folk singer fearlessly indulges in radical activism against political wrongdoings. A defence lawyer, living a prosperous life, selflessly rallies behind those arrested unlawfully. A public prosecutor dutifully pursues the job to her without worrying about the legitimacy of a case. A judge obliviously relies on obsolete laws rather than the spirit of the law. A widow hopes to earn her living rather than accept charity. This is the world of Court, where the anguish of its characters easily shatters one’s thoughts of an ideal world. The case of this activist poet, allegedly charged for abetting the widow’s husband to commit suicide, is what binds this world together.Court outdoes routine courtroom dramas to the last bits because of its radical storytelling. Instead of taking sides or being an interpreter, it chooses to be a distant observer. The simplicity with which Tamhane builds his characters and their backstories without uttering a single direct word is quite an achievement. Letting their agonies do all the talking, he paints a stark picture of the widening inequality and the worrying state of freedom of speech. He refuses to be preachy even while laying out the tiniest details – be it the Dalit killings, political propaganda or the plight of blue-collar workers.Since our judgment hinges on cultural and social milieu, Tamhane takes you away from the courtroom to their personal lives. Appearing inconsequential on the face, the lifestyles offer great insight and prove to be a master stroke element in  the plot. A pragmatic approach in unfolding the story stays true to the subject and pays off, despite virtually non-existent drama. The film uses courtroom as a means to lay bare the flaws of Indian society at large rather than ridiculing judicial system alone.With authentic production design, prolonged shots and no background score; Tamhane not only presents you the dull judicial proceedings, but also makes you feel the drabness. Each camera angle and its movement is well designed and keeps you involved as an observer. A striking balance between visual treatment and colour palette harmonizes the realism, making the film powerful. The repetitive use of bluish hues, even in warmer tones, creates an air of sombreness and monotony – which is perfectly in consonance with its theme. The lighting conditions dip from bright to dark as the trial unfolds, depicting its gloominess. When was the last time an Indian film excelled so well in visual storytelling? Bravo!Vira Sathidar portrays Narayan Kamble impeccably.It’s hard to believe he is a non-actor, as are all other characters. Sambhaji Bhagat’s invigorating vocals bring a huge difference to his act. I am not sure if radical songs can instigate someone to commit suicide. But they certainly have enough vigour to make you adore them, just as they add to the film's advantage.Court effortlessly manifests that hardcore realism can serve as an engaging experience. No wonder it is indisputably the best debut of the times and Tamhane gets everything right, something that is sure to leave many of his contemporaries as well as seasoned filmmakers in awe. Films like this make me believe that the resurgence of Marathi cinema is truly a thing of reality. If anything, resurgence at its staggering best.

168,266,266,266,266,Crazy Stupid Love,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/crazy-stupid-love-review/,,5/5.0,,3.6,"They are crazy, they are stupid, and they are all in...surprise...love! Right from the too-mature-for-his-puberty-hormones 13-year old to his parents going through mid-life crisis to anyone who crosses their path. It's your regular rom-com, the com bit of which you saw it in the trailer. And the rom bit has a couple of ""aawwww"" moments. Other than that there's nothing much in this largely superficial film.","It's kind of tiring when ALL the characters in a film have a U-turnaround. Of course, there's barely anything you cannot predict about a rom-com. But there is something about the chemistry, the ""lines"", the situations that you look forward to. Crazy Stupid Love has a little bit of this and an o-kay bit of that, but none of it is satisfying enough to make me recommend the film to you, even if it's playing on TV. You have your regular cool, suave Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who knows how to objectify women and get them anyway. He obviously, guides simple, clueless-around-women-because-he-respects-them Cal (Steve Carell) through finding his ""manhood"". That stage set, the women flit in and out of the screen as per convenience. But, the actors who play these women, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone and even Analeigh Tipton are so strong that they make their presence felt, however short their screen time may be. In comparison, the two men Ryan Josling and Steve Carelljust look like they are going through the drill of looking HOT and confused respectively. What broke my heart was Marisa Tomei's performance. Where is the lady who blows my mind away every time I watch My Cousin Vinny? In Crazy Stupid Love, she is over-acting and rather melodramatic. :( In fact, a lot of things in the film are melodramatic - from the slo-mo for Jacob, to a repeat-for-effect for Steve Carell; from people in audience/on street clapping for the protagonists for no good reason, to the climax. All effectively cringe-worthy. In the middle of this though are some of the funny scenes from the trailer and some cozy, romantic moments. Are they enough to pull you through though? Would have/could have, had there been a better climax. The one twist in the film is pretty cool, but it all falls flat with the ""whatevaa"" feeling the film gives when it ends. And that did it for me, till then I was doing alright with all the side-stories the film is laced with, they were all interesting. But, they led nowhere. And they have some shock-value situations and dialogues thrown in. They make you smile, but their purpose to catch you off-guard is transparent. You soon realize, they weren't necessary for core plot to move forward.I'm being realistic here. Yes, I see the irony. Realistic for a rom-com! Anyway, I'm being realistic in that I didn't expect to be swept off the floor. But, I thought I'd have fun. For most parts, I didn't.

The win-win situation - They were good both when the film started well and also when it ended ridiculously bad","Diaspora films (at least those made in India) have a tendency to comment negatively about the local conditions which the protagonists live in. They complain about racism while doing the exact same thing. It makes me cringe - because neither do all locals behave that way, nor are all Indians so hopelessly bigoted; because some people on both sides are blatantly intolerant. So, the filmmakers either propagate a stereotype the world can live without or we see scary ""humans"" on screen. To top it off, this film is all about racism. Very rarely, does a film even try to balance the dichotomy. Crook does. At least try. Crook doesn't. Succeed. Crook over-compensates in the other direction. After a decent start with back and forth between characters who have different opinions on racism, the film goes overboard in villainizing the Indians. The film takes the 'clinical insanity' route to explain the fanaticism but it goes beyond the realm of acceptability and falls flat on the face. Similarly, the motivations of the protagonist and the film itself don't hold water because of how dramatic the situation gets by the end. Also, the problems, the issues, the situations, the dialogue all get very repetitive. Yet it's a bold film. Also for a change, I didn't mind watching Emraan Hashmi, he has a reasonable range of expressions. Neha Sharma certainly has a better screen presence than the posters give away. The rest of the cast was the usual combination of loud, filler caricatures. How I wish the balance they struck in the first half of the film didn't go so out of control in the last hour. Oh well...I've always had this question about the Indian-culture-nazis who live abroad. I finally get to ask it out loud - Why do people move abroad if they want to stay so Indian and hate the locals from the deepest place the gut is hidden?

170,268,268,268,268,[The] Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/the-curious-case-of-benjamin-button-review/,,,,4.2,"A satisfying drama with an unusual premise that allows the viewer to reflect on life, love, and loss.","David Fincher is known for his films that tend to be ruminative, bleak inquiries into the human condition, as seen through the eyes of the chief protagonist. His earlier Seven and Fight Club both starred Brad Pitt and were extremely grim. Here he teams up with writer Eric Roth (of Forrest Gump fame) and Brad Pitt for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and gives us a film which is in parts hopeful and uplifting, with respect to its take on life and living. One essential feature of being human is our capacity to reflect on our lives; we try hard to make some sense out of all the chaos that we experience. We are bound by Time; we are born young and are inexorably doomed to age, and die. That is something we cannot defeat. One tends to visualize life as a journey; a journey where we acquire companions and lose them, knowing fully well that there would come a time when we would be lost to others too. 
But what if it all happened in reverse? Just supposing that one is born old; then the journey would start with old age and end with baby hood. This would provide us with a completely different perspective; we would be born looking at the world with eyes that are old and rheumy and die in the cradle. This is the angle that the film adopts, and the director and writer use this outlook to fashion a story about the chief character’s (Benjamin Button) life. The similarities with Forrest Gump are immediately obvious; Benjamin is born with a debilitating physical condition, there is a woman who remains the love of his life, he moves through well defined time periods in American History, and tries to make sense of it all and in the process gives some pithy sayings about life. The key difference is that in Forrest Gump, History was one of the main characters, Gump existed as a prop for History; here History is given short shrift
(though we are constantly aware of it as an addendum to the frame). The movie is not that cheesy either (remember that line about life and a box of chocolates in Forrest Gump?), it instead comes across as a rather detailed portrait of Benjamin Button. The movie has three stages: Benjamin’s childhood, his coming of age as he leaves home to learn a trade, and his eventual return and death. Brad Pitt is Benjamin Button and his portrayal is satisfactory Special effects technologies are employed to transform Brad Pitt's physical appearance at various stages in the film. The special effects are very well done, including the makeup for the face and skin, that blend completely into the frame. But Pitt's acting somehow falls short; as a child Pitt does nothing that would demonstrate the limitations that his body has with respect to his mental age.  We see no glimpses of mischief, nor of childlike curiosity barring a couple of fleeting scenes. But that is it, and somehow this tremendous opportunity to reflect on how a young child (mentally) trapped in an old and aged body would respond is completely lost. Benjamin Button’s character also comes across as too goody goody, there is nary a bad bone in his body and he is constantly polite and clear of heart. That is something difficult to digest, and especially with his physical condition. We see no signs of frustration, irritation, or anger; he is as sweet as an angel throughout. Contrast this with Daniel Day Lewis’s performance in My Left foot for example. The supporting cast is tremendous. Taraji Henson as Queenie is very good and so is Tilda Swinton as Elizabeth Abott. 
The portrayal of the tugboat captain, Captain Mike, who considers himself an artist, by Jared Harris is brilliant. 
Cate Blanchett is adequate throughout; she looks particularly radiant when she plays the younger Daisy. David Fincher maintains a steady tempo and sticks to old fashioned story telling; no sudden shifts in time, no fast cuts, and no handheld cameras either. The tale unfolds at a leisurely pace, and is packed with incidents, and hence the pace does not flag. The period feel is beautifully recreated; the opening footage of the clock maker who makes a clock which runs in reverse, the scenes of Benjamin’s childhood in the old age home, the meetings with Elizabeth Abbott in the lobby of the Russian hotel, all look and feel natural. The movie seems to suggest a subversive message – that old age is not all that bad and that growing younger is something to be feared and avoided. This is in complete contrast to the youth obsessed consumer culture that is prevalent today. The movie also possibly points out that both old age and childhood are nearly the same – something that the Bard of Avon also pointed quite some centuries ago. This is a film which flows gently; there are no sudden surprises, no fortuitous acts of God either. Overall the film is rock solid without being outstanding, and is definitely for those who would want to think about their lives in the dark comfort of a theatre.

You want to do something about it but feel helpless and lost. We rant about it, we complain about the administration. Bloggers blog about it. And filmmakers, well, at least some of them make films to present their point of view. D-Day ultimately, comes across as a filmmakers rant. Writer-director Nikhil Advani sets up his characters in a rather dull manner. You know their sad stories, but you don't really care for them, till interval point. At break time, the twist suddenly makes you wonder what will happen to these characters. Thereafter though, instead of piquing the build-up, the narrative flattens. The pace of the action film slackens into moments of reflections by the characters. This is a shame because the turmoil of the male lead characters is played out really well. Thematically, this starts off with wonderful editing between a R&AW mission and a song at a wedding. But, when such treatment is juxtaposed with the film's larger theme, the pace becomes very uneven. Uneven writing doesn't help the cause. Loyalties change; enemies find out each others' moves and companions; the incredible happens, just out of nowhere. Towards the end, D-Day comes across more as a fantasy of what ought to happen in the real world than trying to keep it real. Interestingly, the climax seems to be talking simultaneously to our administration of what they ought to do and to the terrorists warning them against what we could be capable of. And what about that is not going to go down well with the audience?A very capable Irrfan Khan and a flat-but-effective performance by Arjun Rampal are D-Day's high points. Rishi Kapoor does whatever he's asked to do with ease. Unfortunately, his character isn't menacing enough to give him room to instill fear. Huma Qureshi barely makes her presence felt. You really wonder if there is a reason other than equal representation in a spy team, for her to be included. Shruti Haasan, on the other hand, has a better, more meaningful role. Interestingly, her performance seems effective when she has shorter lines. Beyond a line or two and her accent begins to falter, which makes it very distracting.The number of songs, even while they play in the background are too many and slow down the proceedings considerably. The film lingers too much for an action film. Post-interval, the plot goes haywire and the editing loses grip except for a few sequences. Even in those wonderful sequences, it stretches a bit longer than optimum - enough to make you impatient.D-Day wants to be a stylish take on the psyche of the martyrs of this country while also trying to make a larger point about how terrorism ought to be handled. And, it also wants to be a thriller. Too much on one plate.

Other irritants like disjointed screenplay, an unengaging narrative, distracting accents seem secondary in comparison.","I'm always looking forward to stories told by new writer/directors and especially when almost the whole team is fresh. The most known faces in DAM 999 are Ashish Vidyarthi, Rajit Kapoor and Linda Arsenio from Kabul Express. But DAM 999 has a very choppy style of narration to thrill you. That besides, just about everything else takes away from the sort-of, kind-of novel plot point. I saw the English version, so the accents of the Indian actors seemed very affected - Just like the Hindi of a non-Indian sounds in a Hindi film. I know it’s a difficult call, but watching Megha Burman exaggerate her Ts and Cs when her character is bred in Kerala(?) and is raised by a south Indian played by Rajit Kapoor who goes to great extent to bring on the South Indian language. I'm discussing the accents in such detail because they act as major distractions and don't allow the characters, which might be well written, to grow on you. Also, they take away from the performances. Even if I let that go, there is another major nuisance glaring at you. 3D. Why? Not one scene, not a single one required the technology. DAM 999 unnecessarily ended up being two shades darker and made me spend those extra Rs.30 on the deposit for the glasses. Every once in a while I took the glasses off and the picture was crystal clear - which means it was actually 2D in play. What a scam, I tell you! And certainly a put-off. The commentary at the beginning of the film alludes to the fact that the story is going to use the 'navarasa' to express various characters. Also, there is some mumbo-jumbo about the nine planets being the forces behind all life. And some other forced use of the number nine to justify the 999 in the title. The story has nothing more to it than a politician controlling everything around him to achieve his political aspirations. The rest, including the entire set-up on the ship, are side-stories that aimed at covering the 999 mentioned above.DAM 999 most certainly took on its plate a lot more than it could chew. 3D, navarasa, 9 planets, 4 languages, politics, social impact of dams, to name a few. The result is a combination of bland actors trying too hard to play out a plot that is all over the place.

Engages, though only in pieces.","Daawat-e-ishq starts out with strongly with its theme again dowry. It makes you belch at the people who ask for dowry, just in case you weren't already there. Which is fine and you wonder where its going to take you from here. You fly into this bizarre zone where One lie begets another and things mess up considerably. Only to end with a quick and convenient solution, not to mention predictable. Yet the earnestness in the performances and the issue the film supports keep you reasonably engaged.Parineeti Chopra, Aditya Roy Kapoor and Anupam Kher are all completely comfortable under the skin of their characters. In fact, Parineeti Chopra (Gullu) seems repetitive considering the Gullu is runs parallel to the characters she played in Ladies vs Ricky Bahl and Ishaqzaade. Anupam Kher amazes no end, for the first few seconds he is on screen, I almost didn't realise it was him, given his accent, mannerism and dialogue delivery. Sure, he slips every now and then as the film progresses, but those first few seconds stay with you. Aditya Roy Kapoor too makes you believe the rawness of his character, Tariq even though Tariq himself is rather liberated compared to the backstory he has. That is what charms you about Daawat-e-ishq. It has the most unbelievable situations and the characters go back and forth in their dilemmas depending on the situation they are presented with. Yet you kind-of sort-of want them to behave the way they do at every juncture of the story. It is a rarity in Hindi films, this mixture of wanting characters to behave in a certain way irrespective of how unbelievable it is.  The rest then, the songs, the accent, the Hyderabadi/Lucknowi flavor are all mere salt and pepper added to cover the bland even if silly meat of the film. In fact, the last stretch of the film feels like even the makers realised that they've brought the film to such a twisted point that there is no smooth and natural way to unwind. It had to be done by hook or crook and that's pretty much what happens.In a way, these convoluted mechanisms take away from the social issue that the film so passionately wants to support. You are left wondering what the film is in fact saying about the situation of the dowry system of the country. You might be dead sure that it is a horrific system, but having it intertwined with the desperate measures dowry givers have to make shifts focus. A film with this issue at its heart might not want to be at a place where there are ifs and buts around the issue.

How can she be the snoot who ignores a packed house is dancing and clapping its way to the background score of an action sequence? She laughs at the silliness on screen and off. She walks out of the theater feeling happy for the people who had come to enjoy and made sure they had a good time. But enjoy, for her own self, did she? Nope. Not a chance.","No one can say, ""Dabangg falls short of expectations."" - Salman Khan fan or not. The kind of 600-odd youngsters that come for an 8:30AM show; those who boo at trailers because they stand between Dabangg and them; they can't wait for their hero's grand entry - these people certainly fall in a skewed sample set. But they are the target audience too. Vouching for Dabangg, on their behalf, is easy. Thanks to the deafening cheers at every line Salman Khan mouthed and even at some non-verbal, action-packed sequences. Me? Well, I am an outsider in such a forum. I try to go with the flow but it just isn't my kind of film, Dabangg.Dabangg turned out to be what I thought it would be - Salman Khan playing himself (for he knows no other way); reasonable action; cheeky one-liners; good music; and loads of nonsense in the story but who cares about that anyway, right? In fact, I'll go out on a limb and say Dabangg even exceeded my expectations - Salman Khan plays Rajnikanth; there are a few awesome moves in the fight sequences; and the plot is loosely coherent. But then again, I'm no Rajni-fan either. ducks brickbat(s). At least, that attack on me isn't animated by some shoddy computer graphics. And they are not bad copies from various other films either. Also no chick editor snap and sew it together oh-so-quickly. Hey, who am I kidding, I ain't Salman Khan fan either.Every actor in the film takes cue from Salman Khan. Take one expression and stick to it. Be it Vinod Khanna or Dimple Kapadia. Oh, Sonakshi Sinha, she has two to switch between - disturbed-why-me and smile-when-my-admirer-wants-me-to. Her role seems to have gone under some heavy-duty scissors. Only that can explain the gaps in her character arc. Producer and item-numberer, Malaika Arora Khan makes a better impact on your memory than Sonakshi Sinha. Films of this genre can't be bothered by things like consistency and comprehension, and this one at least makes an attempt. Fails miserably, but tries nevertheless. It actually takes time to set the characters and their relationships up. The script goes on to build on this background, too. But, the rush to wrap it up shows. The urge to put in more action and less story, becomes transparent. Thus starts a race for the quickest character transition - be it good to evil or the other way around. The change is glaring at you even harder because of the extremes that each of these characters have gone to in the opposite direction. You remember the 80s.The broad plot tries to say something about national issues, from political to social, from dowry to bribery. But then they are left loose. Not that I want any preaching from anyone. But those elements don't find conclusion and that's sort-of disorienting. You leave with questions that didn't look like they were intentionally so.Oh, look at me trying to impersonate an intellectual fart. Go on people, go enjoy your annual dose of Salman Khan. I love to see people let their hair down, abandon care and just have a good laugh...or dance. Even if it is to the tune of a wannabe 'omakara' or 'beedi jalai le'.

But that means nothing to the Saman-fan now, does it? So eye-rollers like me, can continue with the eye-workout. The fans - well, like they need a go ahead from anyone. ","The best part about a Salman Khan film is the herd of Salmaniacs you are surrounded by. Oh, the whistles, the cheers, the non-stop cackle and overall enthusiasm. I would get through many a Salman film just to be in the middle of that  kind of energy. And Dabangg 2 didn't have even that! The crowd was surprisingly cold except for the mandatory excitement at grand-entry time and during the songs. But, usually the songs get more out of the fans. The first in this series,  Dabangg had teenage girls in the audience dancing to the background music of the final fight sequence. Here it was restricted to general cheering and hooting. Since I don't get the mania anyway, and am very unlikely to enjoy the film by itself, my only barometer is the audience reaction - which was rather underwhelming.The introductory action sequence feels like a recap of  Dabangg and you wait for something new and fun in terms of action to come up soon. You keep waiting. There is nothing new or funny about them, they are just repetitive. Only this time, the sound design does the 'action' rather than the usual camera and/or editing. In the name of action choreography, people fall here, there and everywhere in the same old fashion. In stead you are served one song after another, a few obviously inserted to give the feeling that Sonakshi Sinha had something to do. And in one she was even pitted against Malaika Arora Khan, which I didn't quite understand. Was it some way of making the contrast in terms of looks and dancing skills even more apparent?Let's not waste our breath over story, it's the same old cop, up against the goon-turned-politician. Only this one is conveniently honest so that he can be Robin-Hood-cum-Kungfu-Panda. Interestingly, the other cops too are all honest and want to do the right thing. This version of Bollywood cop though is soon amalgamating into one, only the 'star' playing him changes - from Dabangg to Singham to Rowdy Rathore this police officer is fusing together and one is difficult to tell apart from the other. That two of these have Sonakshi Sinha as lead lady and two have Prakash Raaj as villain doesn't make it easier. Of the lot, Prakash Raaj and to an extent Vinod Khanna try their best to bring life to their characters. The rest are just doing the drill, ably led by Salman Khan. Is it not disconcerting to the Salman fan that his playback singer, Sukhwinder Singh is singing his soul out while he barely moves his lips for lip-sync? How is that cool? So, Salman Khan continues to adorn his 'acting' with an attitude of nonchalance. He gets to play silly pranks which can slide by as cute.Speaking of silly, the silliest gets sillier here and you are left with no choice but give it a laugh. Yet, the dialogue and especially the one-liners, save maybe one or two, carry no weight. Not even those repeat lines given to characters in order to define them, a la 'aata maajhi satakli' or  Dabangg's own 'chhed'. 
To top it off the relatively funnier lines of the lot are repeated to push them down your throat and make sure you 'got' them. However, I did enjoy the language a lot. 'Clean' Hindi is indeed refreshing, even if it sounds fake and forced.I know a Salman Khan film is no place for me. But, I really do love being in a theater, especially if there is hope of a lively audience. Here's hoping it will work the next time around like it did in Dabangg. Oh yes, there will be a Dabangg 3.ps. Yes, yes, ladies (and gentlemen) the shirt comes off.

176,274,274,274,274,Daddy,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma reviewPreview30 Critic Reviews 2/5.0 1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/daddy-review/,2/5.0,3/5.0,,3.066666667,A relatively engaging last half hour. Only if you can sit through gun fight after gun fight after gun fight that is typical of a film based in the underworld.,"There is nothing remarkable about Daddy for about an hour and a half of the film. The film looks and feels like any other mafia gang war film and the story is exactly that too. The last half hour or so has some actual meat to it, showing us a peek into what Arun Gawli (Arjun Rampal) thought and did. While relentless gun fights, gory violence included, is a given in a film of this genre, the narrative tool used was the most off-putting. You follow Inspector Vijay (Nishikant Kamat) as he interviews people close to Gawli – his mother, his associates, his friend's girlfriend and so on. Which would have been fine, if he was learning about Gawli along with the audience. Here, the inspector clearly ought to have known whatever he was interrogating about in the first place and in fact even says so at one point. This “tell, don't show” structure kept me at an arm's distance through most of the film.It doesn't help that the subject of the film – the glorification of a renown mafia leader – isn't enticing in the first place. Even if he took from the rich to give to the poor, even if he wished to reform himself, even if his heart was never into violence to begin with – his misdeeds aren't easily forgivable. Also, there is always a nagging feeling that under the garb of an impartial take, there still lies a bias in the story-telling. I strongly sensed that we weren't being given the whole story made a little more obvious by the gaping holes in the story. There were other elements in the story that seemed more gratuitious than the need of the situation. These mostly related to the scenes with sexual intimacy. Given the context, none of them made them were a necessary part of the story. Fortunately, you have believable performances across the board. The action-heavy nature of the film doesn't necessarily need a huge variety of emoting, but Arjun Rampal, Nishikant Kamat, Aishwarya Rajesh, Rajesh Shringarpore keep things real. In terms of the milieu too, the grungy, sepia tone works. I must say though, the men's hairstyles were quite distracting. Many of them felt like they were uncomfortable in their wigs instead of the hairdo blending with the characters.Daddy, comes across as an earnest defense for one of the most feared men of his times. I lived in Mumbai during those times. I don't remember hearing of any of his Robinhood deeds. Maybe they were deliberately kept under wraps. If this film was made to invoke sympathy for a man who might wrongfully be in prison today, it didn't really do much in that direction. Lacking balance, it just might have pushed the audience, that can be bothered to care, even further in the other direction.

Never really goes past standard romance, copycat events, drained actions, pointless plot, glorified mannerisms, sham production... But if this doesn’t bother you, the film just works for you.","There is a hyper-realistic police encounter in Abhijit Phanse’s brash underworld drama Rege. A top cop slays an innocent in order to mark his century of encounters. There is a similar situation, not entirely though, in Dagdi Chaawl. Albeit, there is a pretty big gulf between the two, the biggest one being the periods both are set in, Rege transcends with relative ease, as a result of our acquaintance with today’s era. Even Hindi crime masterpieces – Satya, Shool or perhaps Ab Tak Chhappan – presumably explain the upper hand, having set and shot in a fairly identical era. Set in the 90s and shot in 2015, Dagdi Chaawl has some serious, periodic-shift issues to address. Recreating the era is by far gruelling, but not unattainable. But it is as much about will, vision, research, writing and execution, as it is about big bucks – or the lack thereof. As goes the rule of thumb, never expect.In the so-called resurgent times of Marathi cinema, we have makers (like every film industry does) stuck within the confines of popularism. And final results are not dissimilar to Dagdi Chaawl, an ideal world where a middle-class young man is the lone heartthrob in his chawl. Hardworking, educated, supportive, friendly, sincere, he is probably too suave to disagree with. He gets any job done before you even know it. Yes, he can blindfoldedly break matkas as well, good no? But this Mr. Perfect is not new to us, nor is the story of a young, picture-perfect girl relocating to the chawl. This traditional setup obviously bestows him with courtship. Once they mingle, an unexpected conflict (read hackneyed) barges in. Our hero saves her modesty, inviting a bigger conflict (again, hackneyed). Thus begins the fate of his survival and that of the film.The sorry tale of our films is that they just can’t imagine stuff without the conventional romance. But its dominance here is so much so that the love story alone occupies one third of the runtime. Whoa, wasn’t this film supposed to be about gangster-turned-politician Arun Gawli, if entirely not his biopic? Ankush Chaudhari is leading and ruling (ruining as well) the one-man show, and not Makarand Deshpande as Gawli. Put the infamous aura of Gawli and his Dagdi Chawl out, you witness another tasteless attempt at crime genre. Having little to do with these characters, what’s the significance of the title then? Yet, it seems to be paying off when you see fellow audiences whistle and clap to Daddy’s well-coined swags.Notorious and menacing in the 80s-90s, Daddy and his gang appear as a shadow of themselves in the film. The self-styled evil force looks nerveless and ready-made. Deshpande, being a highly gifted performer, impresses a bit. I don’t blame him once he fails, though. Chaudhari’s wisdom, on the contrary, poses a big question as he gets entangled. He is the saviour for people around him, but not himself. He has solutions up his sleeves for any given situation, but not his own dilemmas. But that said, when a star is essaying the role, what’s the nuisance of character writing for? Nobody is going to notice that just like the middle-class heroine’s designer wears and loud makeup.There seems to be a dearth of novelty in storytelling. Exploring beyond voice-overs and flashbacks is rarity these days. This film, though, takes the writing laziness to a new level. Events bring no real thrills. Flashbacks after flashbacks add no dimension to the narrative. Set pattern of revealing mysteries instead lays bare the shortage of ideas. And don’t get swayed by some clap-worthy, funny moments. That’s a first-rate addition, but doesn’t let me ignore the inadequacies. Admirable on the face of it, the production or visual treatment negate what the setting truly calls for. Despite that, the appearance is most likely to blot out the failings. Whether that is makers’ sole triumph (?) or our ignorance, the job is done already.Gawli is no Sarkaar. But that doesn’t make him a weakened cinematic persona. The intensity this character brings forth can put many fictional gangsters to shame. You perhaps don’t need to get his looks right as done in the latest disaster. But getting his aura and the period spot on is far more ambitious. The hope is that this does happen someday. RGV, you listening?

Matthew McConaughey knocks another one out of the park with his convincing performance. ","If you've watched The Wolf of Wall Street; if you're hooked on to True Detective, and if you know a little bit about Chris Nolan's upcoming film Interstellar, then you know that Matthew McConaughey is on a bit of a roll. His physical transformations are a wonder in themselves; but what is truly special is how he moulds himself into the quirky but vastly different characters that he does. In Dallas Buyers Club, McConaughey plays Ron Woodroof, a gruff Texan homophobe who discovers that he has AIDS, and is told by the doctor that, based on his current condition, he has 30 days to live. Woodroof, however, has no plans to kick the bucket so soon; so he decides to take matters into his own hands.Dallas Buyers Club creeps up on you slowly. It is a stark, disturbing film at times, and oddly charming at others. Ron Woodroof's story is undoubtedly inspiring - a shining example of how just one's attitude and outlook can go such a long way in improving the quality of life. The film is set primarily in the mid-80s, when AIDS was still a mystery, and it was surrounded by a number of myths that have since been debunked. Thus, the film also has plenty of important social messages in it. It reminds you that life doesn't have to be tragic and restricted if you're affected by HIV or AIDS. Also, watching Ron Woodroof's graph of being absolutely homophobic, one who is appalled by the mere thought of homosexuality, to then ending up having a deep friendship with the unlikeliest of people, his character wins you over every step of the way.The film's best moments, though, are easily the David and Goliath battle that Ron Woodroof fights with an unfair government agency - which you'll discover in the film. Even though you're not strictly supportive of the moral implications of Woodroof's actions, you support him, because everyone fundamentally identifies with a key driving thought for all of humankind - that everyone has the right to choose their own way of life. As mentioned earlier, McConaughey's lean look is a wonder indeed, but it isn't a patch on Jared Leto's transformation into the transgender Rayon. In fact, it was only in the close credits that I realized it was him. A brave role and a marvellous effort in slipping in to character, Leto is simple terrific. Jennifer Garner as the kindly doctor who sympathizes with Woodroof is also superb.We're so used to rooting for white characters, that we tend to forget that we're all actually grey. Dallas Buyers Club reminds us of the fact that in real life, we're all grey, and yet some of us lead lives that are worth living and worth dying for. It entertains you, moves you and educates you, just like that.

This for a person who gets easily bored in wrestling films, let alone the sport itself.","Just the number of social topics that Dangal touches upon could've worked against the film. Many a film that has tried this,  has suffered from spreading itself too thin for its own good. But Dangal builds one theme on another relentlessly. It even lets some of them run in parallel - all without losing sight of any single one – at the same time it creates and retains my interest in a sport, the existence of which is otherwise incomprehensible to me.This is not to say that it is not as predictable as any underdog story. That it is. In fact, you know how the last fight will end, and when the national anthem plays at the beginning you get an inkling of exactly how the audience is expected to react to that last fight. The beauty is that I didn't mind it.  I didn't mind the precious run-time spent on the usual rigorous training montages that go with this genre. I didn't mind the usual “success goes to underdog's head” phase. I didn't mind the occasional slack in pace. I didn't mind sitting through almost an hour of only and only – wrestling matches. This is so because at any given point there are lots of things at play and they all weave together seamlessly.In fact, all my apprehensions - about an Aamir Khan film becoming more about Aamir Khan than the subject matter that he has taken to heart - melted with the first two scenes. The humor took me in. Sure, the laughs don't stay long. They dissipate along with Mahavir Singh Phogat's (Aamir Khan) hopes of having a son. But, stronger themes like passion, woman empowerment, angst against system, take hold – none of which are new, but all are sewed together into a story that make you root for its protagonist. The protagonist here is not Mahavir Singh Phogat, it is his daughter – Geeta Kumari Phogat (Zaira Wasim followed by Fatima Sana Shaikh). You empathise with her when her dad's aspirations are forced on her, you sympathise with her when she tries to wing out of her father's shadow. For a lot of the journey, even though Mahavir Phogat is in the scene, your focus is on her. It is a pleasant surprise to see Aamir Khan let the other characters take center stage - even if it is a side character like Mahavir's wife or his nephew – while he maintains his own screen presence.. The actor himself does well from being athletic to pot-bellied. It is almost as if he shot the younger-Mahavir scenes while he was shooting for Dhoom 3. Physique aside, we completely register Mahavir's frustration, anger, joy, conceit, hurt ego, pride. Some parts even convince you that the actor might be this tyrannical in real life too. The rest of the cast – including Fatima Sana Shaikh – are all so refreshing. From Sakshi Tanwar to Girish Kulkarni to Sanya Malhotra to Aparshakti Khurrana (Thank you, @Minu Nair for the name!) - they all fit in perfectly. It is exhilirating that off late, across films, actors are getting better and better at their jobs, even if the other departments of the film fail them. Fortunately, that's not true of Dangal. From the diet consultants to prosthetics (maybe?), from the dialect tutors to the writing department, from the fight choreographers to the music and lyrics, and a lot in between – all work in sync and towards one goal, that of making a good, focused film. Sure, the music might not have repeat listening value, but it works beautifully within the context of the film. Above all, it is held together by the writing department. At its root, Dangal is a sports story that spends a lot of time on the back-story. But equally strong is its theme of enabling women. While some of the “tips” to have a boy might amuse us as city-dwellers, I have been told some even more ridiculous tricks to make sure I have a son. It is difficult to shrug it away as funny when I know people who haven't been able to get away with having “just” daughters. It adds on the philosophy of “perspective” through the plight of a young 14-year old girl who's being married off. While still on the issue of exasperating, gender-related bias, the movie manages to comment on how something that makes business sense goes through despite societal outrage against wrestling girls. It is almost amusing that the movie turns a house of woman objectification into a study room to empower a woman. Closer to home, a parenting struggle that I go through day in and day out is brought to the fore. To push a child beyond her breaking point so that she achieves what I see as her potential or to let her be and blossom the way her personality drives her? What takes priority – my son losing his childhood to achieve greatness or him taking his time to figure out if he wants anything extra-ordinary for himself? As their characters build in the story, you wonder whether the clash is between father and daughter as personalities or whether it is that between a usual, teenage know-it-all and an obstinate, aging old man. While Mahavir claims that he passed on his wrestling genes to his daughters, is he aware that he passed on his egoistic genes too. He might be passionate about the sport and acing the sport for his country. But is she? For her it might just be about proving her father wrong – or right. Dangal hits such a sweet blow on the situation of sports in the country. While it seems like it is a contest between national-coach and father-coach, it is actually a comment on how inadequate the coach appointed by the ministry truly is. Sure, some of these story elements might have been dramatised to arouse these particular emotions. Fortunately, the drama is kept at its minimal. I'll leave the thought, “Why do filmmakers think even that much drama is necessary?” to another day.As if this weren't enough, one tiny directorial decision wins the movie for me. In the moment when an underdog needs inspiration, he/she sees a montage of flashbacks and hears quotable quotes that he/she has heard recently in the film. These quotes in hindsight seem like they were placed to inspire at precisely that right moment. No, of course not, Dangal doesn't skip this moment. But, the montage of flashbacks it uses are things, we as an audience, haven't seen earlier. Not all of them are those that were shown to us, just a few minutes ago. They are things that happened years ago in the characters life, that we weren't made privy to. This is so rare in films (not just Hindi films), that I can't resist this extra 150-word paragraph. Yes, it is not remotely enough to make a film “great”, but it makes me “love” a film from “liking it a lot”.Beyond this, Dangal made me look forward to the next wrestling match, even if it were in a film. It doesn't go all technical on me, but I get the rules and my heartbeats fluctuate with Geeta's wins and losses. It is amusing, if not a shame that a cricket analogy had to be used to make a point. But, it brings home the point that whether or not the characters are able to pronounce the word, any sport is made lovable for its “strategy” more than the strength required to win – a strategy that willingly goes for a hand-to-hand battle with bad luck. I am so glad that my skepticism of Aamir Khan films has been proven wrong. Whether or not I agree with Mahavir's parenting, I will watch this one again with my kids - soon.

But at the very least it had a mythological background. Dangerous Ishhq exasperates you with the witchery while trying to keep the setting modern. Just doesn't gel. ","Love can be fatal and thus ishhq, dangerous. So dangerous that it cannot be found nor avenged over 500 years and five reincarnations. As ridiculous as it sounds, I do think there could have been a poetic charm about love over many lives, but the way Dangerous Ishhq is done, it comes across more as a field day for the costume and jewelry designers of the film. The setting with common people having super-human powers in real life didn't quite get with the current day story. Yes, we accept it in our Harry Potters and we accepted weapons that spit light and made sounds in our Ramayans and Mahabharats because the entire setting is such, that of fantasy. Here, we are given the mandatory alternate medicine therapist, a doctor who begins to believe and a cop who doesn't trust - as is seen in most Bhatt films that touch upon the supernatural theme - which just doesn't work. You cannot ask me to 'just believe', you have to make me believe - which just about never happens in reincarnation films - be it one reincarnation or five. Add to that a 'comeback' by an actor from the 90s. The consolation is Karishma Kapoor makes nostalgic by being her same old shrill self who alternates her shrieks with playing a painted, plastic doll. The rest of the cast don't do much to engage you either. That would have been a complaint worth elaborating on had there been a plot that involved you with the character's stories. All you can do is laugh at every time Sanjana (Karisma Kapoor) hallucinated about one of her past lives. Ultimately, it ends up being a show case for Karishma Kapoor in different types of costumes and jewelry. Other than that, I didn't see any other reason for making a film based on this theme.

182,280,280,280,280,[The] Dark Knight Rises,Owner's Pride!,wogma review8 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/dark-knight-rises-review/,,5/5.0,,3.5,"The Dark Knight Rises is closure at its best: wise use of classic components like a brute villain, a slowly growing film that takes its time to revel in it’s linear structure, establishing every detail for you to absorb and an explosive yet comforting end. Do yourself a favour and don’t compare the film to its predecessors. Watch The Dark Knight Rises the way it should be watched: not in 3D, and with an open, patient mind. You will be blown away.  ","Christopher Nolan really knows how to play with our minds. He sparked a whole new world of ideas in our heads with The Dark Knight in 2008, and of course, had a field day with Inception, but if you pay enough attention, you’ll realize that he isn’t trying to impress us with The Dark Knight Rises. Nor is he merely telling a story (or closing one, in this case). As a sensible filmmaker and storyteller, he’s left the best (read: eccentric, layered and mind-boggling) parts behind, with the peak of the trilogy, which was The Dark Knight.The Dark Knight Rises is what a finale should be; all-encompassing yet mysterious enough to hold one’s intrigue, mature, and not experimental in it’s treatment of characters and individual scenes and it builds up to a spectacularly fulfilling, almost calming climax and end. The film begins with a near-dystopian Gotham, a shattered Bruce Wayne and no sign of Batman, 8 years since the tragic night he took the blame for Harvey Dent’s wayward crimes. By now, Gotham has taken an economical and global hit (very well merged with real-life crises) and Bruce Wayne shows no sign of returning as the city’s “masked vigilante”.The slowly panned out first half establishes all it’s characters and the scenario with meticulous detail. This could have been an impatient viewer's grudge with the film, but Nolan gives you enough to bite on before an impending explosion of a second half. We are introduced to Bane (Tom Hardy), a muscular masked terrorist leader who intends on destroying Gotham City. While Hardy’s personality as Bane doesn’t match up to the sinister villains of the previous films (and it’s safe to say here that Ledger’s Joker is very hard to match up to), his sheer gritty look is enough to instill fear. Here his mask does the trick; often you can’t understand what he’s saying but you’re half expecting him to, at any moment, lose his temper and tear everything to pieces. His brute demeanor convinces you that he can break Batman apart, and that coupled with a looming fear is what classic villains are made of. Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) a jewel thief who robs for survival, and has several heated interactions with Batman. Tradionally, she’s known as Bane’s aid, but in the film she follows her own trajectory. Hathaway is strong, witty and plays her part of the Catwoman (although she is never called that) with much panache. Marion Cotillard plays the millionaire Miranda Tate who is a part of the Wayne Enterprises board, and a means of support for Batman as she encourages him to stand up to his responsibility. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake, the young police officer is a symbol of our voices as an audience. Through the film we keep expecting Batman to rise, and we never lose faith in him, and Gordon-Levitt’s character recreates the faith that the film continuously needs to fall back on. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman resume their characters as Alfred, Fox and Gordon respectively. All of this is familiar territory; a predictable build up to Bane’s terrorist plans and as an audience that has seen the first two films, we know what’s in store for us. However, as Batman rises and the film starts rolling into action, every moment that you witness is filled with the baggage of 7 years and 2 films, and Nolan presents every moment victoriously. He gives you what you want to see, triumphs what needs to be triumphed, and slashes what needs to burn. And therefore, unlike The Dark Knight (and my intention here is not to compare the films but our reception of them), this film doesn’t knock the ground off your feat, but manages to restore it back in place for your sense of stability. 
The Dark Knight Rises is mature story telling; it closes ends but also leaves a tiny mischievous slit open. It has a barrage of inspiring dialogue and superhero morals soaked in action-heavy sequences that are visually epic (kudos to cinematographer Wally Pfister and Hans Zimmer for the audio-visual treat). 
Essentially, the film gives you everything that you would need in a finale. You might have wanted more unexpected craziness and more edge of the seat moments (the expectations this film was riding on was almost unreal). However, The Dark Knight Rises is more about what you need as a viewer (and a follower of the trilogy), which is a fluctuating closure: one that’s classic and mature, and yet satisfies your need to be surprised. And for recognizing and executing that, take a bow Nolan.

183,281,281,281,281,Dark Shadows,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/dark-shadows-review/,,,,3.5,"Okay I’ll admit Dark Shadows is better than the soapy Twilight series – both Johnny Depp and Eva Green give you enough to laugh once in a while. But if you’ve been following the Burton-Depp franchise since Edward Scissorhands in 1990, you will find yourself disappointed with this complacent effort of a film.","Another Tim Burton film starring Johnny Depp – totally did not see that coming! After 7 films together, their films now, are more a celebration of their eccentric partnership than anything else. Dark Shadows is a primary example of this fact. Obviously, Depp plays his part with absolute charm, (he’s like the male Meryl Streep, incapable of doing anything bad, but I digress.) Dark Shadows however, is like a well-dressed girl who has nowhere to go. It’s a grand production, with an elaborate set design and costumes, but lacks substance.Based on the popular American soap opera from the early 70s, Dark Shadows surrounds vampire Barnabass Collins (Depp) who is resurrected from his coffin at 1972 after 200 years. He finds that the glorious empire is ruined, and his fisheries business is falling. To top it all, the ruthless witch who turned him into a vampire, Angelique (Eva Green) is now ruling their coastal town. The film tracks how he saves his hometown, by teaming up with the Collins’ family matriarch (Michelle Pfieffer).The basic premise of the film has scope – here is a vampire from 200 years ago who still believes the world starts and ends with him. He’s dated, and the humor stems from that fact that he doesn’t fit. Dark Shadows does have its moments, mainly because we all know Johnny Depp has his way with wit. You will find yourself laughing, but it’s also a token humor that you know is forceful. You realize that you keep expecting the film to get funnier – but it doesn’t.The performances do manage to give you 140 minutes of entertainment, if you ignore the follies. Eva Green as the drop-dead gorgeous Angelique is the show stopper of the film. She’s sharp, funny (yes the funniest part of the film for sure) and stunning. Like most Tim Burton films, the setting and mood is applaud-able. Sets, costumes and dialogues all transport you to an eccentric alternate world that governs most Burton films. You also find that the soundtrack is dominating by rock classics of the 70s. Ofcourse, the central factor here is that Dark Shadows is all about Johnny Depp – his extravagant hairdos and frills, his experiments and his charm parade where he tries to knock you off with his humor. Usually, it’s the arrogance that works, but in this case it does seem laborious because it doesn’t have a story to fall back on. If you’re a fan of the Burton-Depp franchise, you might either be extremely disappointed having expected to be blown away or you might just settle for a complacent effort on their part. Dark Shadows could have been a humorous, engaging film as it’s made with all the right decisions in casting and setting. As it is though, the film falls short of its expectations – like a half-baked attempt that you might enjoy only if you worship Johnny Depp.

184,282,282,282,282,[The] Darkest Hour,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/darkest-hour-review/,,,,3.5,"Fear and darkness is certain in a movie where the world is coming to an end. If the reason behind the end is aliens, you need a constant sense of fear, and newer, scarier antics to keep you moving. The Darkest Hour might not give you that consistency in terms of a moving, slowly unfolding film but the background score (more so in beginning of the film) and the visuals will spook you enough. ","For 89 mins, The Darkest Hour is a crisp, fairly-spine chilling film that gives you the necessary thrills, considering the only good part of the film are the visuals. But then again, a film about alien invasion banks heavily upon the visuals. It seems director Chris Gorak (also art director of Fight Club and director of Wanted) takes that pre-requisite a bit too seriously. The Darkest Hour has flat characters, almost no plot development, but you forgive and forget it as you submerge in the chilly background music and the scary pace. The film starts in Moscow, as two Americans Sean and Ben arrive to sell some high-flying technological software. They meet two American girls eventually (Natalie and Anne – the fact that they don’t have second names, let alone a back story should give you enough proof about the lack of depth in the film) and party the night away. It’s then that invisible aliens - what look like a lethal, dusty mirage - eat into the entire city, killing every single living being. We are shown the alien’s point-of-view as well – where humans look like walking tissues, and on coming in contact with them, humans get reduced to dust. The film then tracks how the survivors from their first attack (all four Americans and the handful Russians they meet on the way) battle their way through this apocalyptic mess they find themselves in.If you need a couple of reasons to watch the film, you’ll be happy to know the effects and scare-factor is at its maximum. It’s a phenomenon I find most of these apocalyptic films have in common regardless of their basic plot. You are going to find the idea of the world (as you know it) coming to an end, extremely creepy. It’s a must-have in any film with such content (like The Day After Tomorrow and 2012).The Darkest Hour banks on this factor. The first half hour is truly terrifying, and you learn to ignore the unexciting acting of the lead foursome (Emile Hirsch, Olivia Thirlby, Rachael Taylor and Max Minghella) but soon enough you realize the color palate, the plot development and the threat (aka the aliens) are all pretty flat. It’s simple; if the aliens are going to be invisible, the plot has the keep the viewer hooked on by topping the horror-factor every now and then. What you see The Darkest Hour is the same incident being repeated again and again. People dying the same way (barring one bus sequence which keeps you on the edge of seat), and only sporadically, you get spooked by some unexpectedness. The real winner of The Darkest Hour is the cinematographer, Scott Kevan, who puts in front of us an extremely gripping visual of a dark city under threat by supernatural forces. It’s this sight that will bring you chills more than dusty, invisible aliens, repetitive background scores and one-dimensional, predictable performances.

The script was far from satisfactory too. If the script does not move forward, how can the actors be expected to change their expressions, you see.

Doesn't look like it is completely researched or devoid of biases, though!","Note: The names mentioned in the cast above have given their voices to various characters. Visit the official site for details.
This description of God and his greatness is pretty skewed according to me. I'm a Hindu too, but I doubt my God is so ego-centric that he won't grant me my wishes if I don't pray to him. Closing my eyes and regurgitating lines in Sanskrit that I don't understand has never gone down well with me. So, when Ajay and his little sister who are sort-of anchors that link the 10 avatars are told to say a ""mantra"" to get to another place, I cringe. And wonder, do I really want my kids to have faith without understanding?That besides though, if the aim is just to get kids acquainted with the subject, Dashatar might be a good start. Of course, 10 stories are told in about 110 minutes, so expectations of details should be minimal. Especially in the longer tales of Rama and Krishna. However, not everything is accurate from whatever tales I've heard since childhood. Not that I have researched the topic in depth, but I have always seen Ravana with ten heads, never with seven. Also, I always thought Ravana was a competitor for Sita's swayamwar (the practice in which a girl chooses a husband from a list of suitors). Then why is he surprised to see that Sita is actually beautiful. And why was Buddha avatar completely omitted? Blunders for a movie aimed at educating the young, if you ask me.But, then again, they have tried to keep it light by including songs. And don't miss the bollywoodification of the Gods and the demons in the Kurma (Turtle) avatar. It is hilarious! Might even offend some people. There's nothing much I can say about the low budget animation other than the fact that it is obviously low budget. And it is low on creativity too. I don't understand why all, Narada, Vishnu, Brahma look the same. Similarly, Sita and Laxmi look the same too. Yet, you see glimpses of good use of colors in a couple of songs, ""Ram Ram Sri Ram"" and ""Tim tim tim tim tare"". So, I would much rather read a Tinkle on the subject to my kids. But, that would be mainly because of the ideological differences with the way God is portrayed. Otherwise, barring a few glaring flaws pointed like the ones above, this movie might be a good way to introduce mythology to the little ones.

Dasvidaniya has enough number of interesting characters that is played by a very capable crew. Characters germinate and grow in enough details for us to see the shades.,"How many times have we complained that life is a rut, nothing new or exciting happens? Even if we've never made that complaint, there's always something that we'd really want to do but never got around to doing, because that needs a little more courage than to stay in our self-nurtured comfort zones. That broken relationship you wanted to mend, the hobby you wanted to pursue and for some of us unfortunately, it takes courage to just sit still enough to find that passion. Amar (Vinay Pathak) who's come to terms with the hand dealt to him is forced to push the self-imposed boundaries before he takes the final bow and says, Dasvidaniya - good bye. This pleasantly plump, obviously nerdy, on-the-wrong-side-of-30s, spineless simpleton makes you feel for him - not pity, but a certain affection. May he be blessed with death if that's what he really, really wants. And you gradually see him mending things in his life, sorting out and repairing the broken parts. You can sense his gradual liberalization as he achieves each item on his life's to-do list. Believe me, I get excited when I see Vinay on the poster of a movie. Post-Bheja Fry, I look forward to a movie featuring him because he has amazing versatility and convincing power. Here too, you can see Vinay's hardwork in every expression. And his prowess is proven more overtly when his alter ego shows up. The courage it must have taken for the makers to cast him as the lead is well rewarded by an overwhelming performance. And all other actors very efficiently provide form and shape to the world around Amar.Dasvidaniya is one of those rarities that bring a smile that refuses to go while a tear rolls down. The dark humor too helps in keeping that smile. And this is despite the leisurely pace at which things proceed. The story is not much more than a one-liner. But each character, however short-lived in the script, is given enough room to bloom and present its shades to us. Amar's response to each character is recorded with finesse. And thus every relationship brings with it a unique chemistry though each one of them is equally warm. Even animosity carries a tender feeling with it.The ever-demanding nature of human beings is very obviously put forth by Amar's ever increasing list. It tells something about ourselves when every time an item is checked off the list there are a few unchecked ones glaring at you. And as you see that, you find Amar taking a pause to just stand and stare - something that brings him immense pleasure. Why wait for the end to knock at your door? Go ahead, make your list. What will it have? That trip to the mountains? The adventure sport that you might not make if a few more years go by? That call you have been avoiding thus far? Whatever they may be make sure there's enough room for ""stand and stare"" on that list.

And Tina Fey needs no introduction (Viewers of 30 Rock, rejoice!) Date Night fits the screwball comedy genre and is thankfully not just a series of gags, placed one after another. The punchlines are funny, as are the performances – a splendid one in a scene featuring Mark Wahlberg – and this isn’t surprising, coming from the director of comedies such as Just Married, Night at the Museum. Couples will love Date Night, especially considering it is a story about the dilemma of a suburban couple, as much as about the mess they get into. Not sure if you want to own it on DVD, but certainly rent it or borrow it.","Q: What is the test of a good comedy film? 
A: One, it should make you laugh while it’s on. 
    Two, it should continue to remind you of the laughter and gags, hours after you've seen it. 
    Three, it should make you want to watch it again and again.Date Night does well on all three counts. Starring the very likable pair of Steve Carell and Tina Fey - both have gained a reputation in all things comedy - and directed by Shawn Levy (Just Married, Big Fat Liar, Night at the Museum).There's also hilarious special appearance by Mark Wahlberg (topless in the film, throughout). The scene when the Fosters land up at his apartment seeking help, continues to make me laugh. I can't help smiling when I remember the way Carrell, Fey and Wahlberg perform that scene. I'm going to take a pause here, to finish laughing. I dare say that Date Night got me laughing a lot more than The Hangover did. I'm quoting Hangover specifically because for many, that films ranks as one of the best comedies from Hollywood. In Date Night, the humour works a lot more because of the fabulous comic timing between the actors - Carrell and Fey are both exceptionally gifted, not just as actors but incredible voice artists (Don't miss ‘the gag reel’ on the DVD). They also enact the bored suburban couple look perfectly in the first few minutes of the film, which is what makes us love them a lot more. The scene where they discuss the status of their married life something that might get married couples look at each other and smile. In fact, couples - both married and unmarried - will especially identify with the Fosters. I loved those scenes where they're at a restaurant and play a guessing game of what stage of relationship couples on other tables may be passing through. The gags and action sort of drag towards the end, and the pole dancing scene was a little extreme, in my view. Since you're watching it on DVD, and I suspect your family members are going to be around, it might make you cringe in your seat. But everything happens for a reason, as do those scenes. Just an indication that despite being in the 'screwball comedy' genre, Date Night manages to be a story about a couple rather than a mere comedy of errors. Try this film on a girl's night out or even on a stag night. Good fun! Don't miss the bloopers and special features on the DVD. There’s a video which profiles one entire schedule in the making of the film, where you learn that the cast and crew are habituated to sleep during the day, since all the shoots happen at night. Director Shawn Levy confidently takes you through each step and the amount of detailing and precision that goes behind setting up each scene, is mind-boggling. Ultimately, you realise that in films that are not verbose, acting is such a small part of the entire film-making process.

190,288,288,288,288,David,Watch when on TV/online,wogma reviewPreview38 Critic Reviews 2.5/5.0,/movie/david-review/,2.5/5.0,,,2.333333333,David is a slick and classy struggle between right and wrong. If only all three stories had enough meat to make for a 2+ hour film. Only 1.5 of the 3 do. ,"With David, Bejoy Nambiar struggles the gray area between right and wrong. Be it love or war - whether an action is right or wrong, many a time, becomes debatable given the situation. Nambiar explores that zone in-between. Unfortunately, only one of the three tales he chooses is compelling and there is a half baked one. Though the third one struggled the most with the dilemma, it seemed more like a comic and romantic relief to take the edge off the seriousness of the other two. David (London, 1975 - Neil Nitin Mukhesh) is part of a Muslim underworld family. Though he is not a part of the family, he is trusted the most. Yet, the family is keeping some of his personal history from him. Should that change his alliance with the family? The most layered of the three, this is the one that tears its David up the most. The black and white treatment stands in good contrast to David's conflict within.  David (Mumbai, 1999 - Vinay Virmani) belongs to a lower middle-class Christian family. A local politician accuses his father, a priest, of trying to convert Hindus into Muslims. David's struggle as a common man is much like the situation of the common man today, over a decade later. The build up in this one with David's quest for why he and his family are suffering kept me intrigued. However, it loses steam towards the end. The way it culminates though resonated the most with me. David (Goa, 2010 - Chiyaan Vikram) is a Goan village's outcast because his wife left him at the wedding altar. Other than the fact, that that makes no sense, I believe in the human race's capacity to hold one person's misfortunes against him. The simplest of them all this one should have had its David miserable between friendship and love. But, somehow that ground is left uncovered and gets diverted with its humor that shuffles between dark, slapstick and quirky.One of David's main problems is the length. Though it has three stories to tell, there are times when the film feels like it is a little all over the place. The only thing holding it together are awesome performance across the board. From the three main leads to Monica Dogra, Tabu, Saurabh Shukla and the people he possesses, right upto Rohini Hatangadi - all give play their bits with conviction.There is one thing I have begun to love about Bejoy Nembiar's films. The way he picturizes his songs. The most unlikely songs are set against some brutal action sequences and yet they sound and look beautiful. Of course, the rest of the film too is slick and has a classy touch to it. The good news is that the feeling I got in Shaitan that his film is a vehicle to showcase all the ""cool"" things he ever wanted to have in films, has reduced. So, yet again, I am left looking forward to his next film. If only, it had more to hold the film together. As far as the connection between the three Davids goes, one David doesn't let the other go out of character while sticking to his roots. The third one, well he's just there waiting to be noticed by one other David. Let's just say this, the three are as connected as you and I. I write what you read, you read what I write. We are all connected by the cosmic energy in between. Call it fate, or call it God's will.

191,289,289,289,289,Days of Being Wild,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/days-being-wild-review/,,,,2.333333333,"Wong Kar Wai’s ability to rely on a display of mundane day-to-day activities to tell a story makes him a fine auteur. Days of Being Wild is smooth, like whiskey as it slowly paces through your veins. The stories reach you as slowly, and hit you with a bang, while you comprehend every level of the film. ","Don’t ever watch a Wong Kar Wai film, if you’re going to text while it plays or pause it periodically. His films are not meant for the passive viewer – and if you still don’t take my advice, you’ll end up with a film that, to you, was an intercutting string of incoherent perspectives. Multiple viewings and a proactive ongoing analysis is necessary to truly enjoy the layers, symbolism and quirks of his narrative.Being in that kind of a mood, I picked up one of his older films, Days of Being Wild. It’s a convoluted story about multiple characters dealing with longing and rejection. Mostly, we see a set of complex endings of even more complex relationships. We start with Yuddy (Leslie Cheung) a handsome man, who would also be known as a smooth ladies' man. He manages to move between women, unintentionally breaking their hearts, but we also realize soon enough that this instability stems from the fact that he is an adopted son to a prostitute mother. He salvages the complexities of his oedipal complex by letting his relationships center around him – while they flow, erupt, and tangle. Through this, we enter the world of Su Lizhen (Maggie Cheung) a shy general store worker, who gets most affected by his mannerisms.She develops a silent, fragile relationship with a local policeman (Andy Lau) as a backup for her broken heart, while we see Yuddy fall in love with a cabaret dancer called Mimi (Carina Lau) – who secretly loves Yuddy’s best friend Zeb (Jacky Cheung). All this is set at the backdrop of Yuddy’s love-hate relationship with his mother. You may wander to deduce that this string of intricate liaisons originates with the mother-son duo – but soon enough Wong Kar Wai creates a different stream for each story. Days of Being Wild isn’t plot heavy, but the story unfolds as each facet of our characters are revealed. There’s a sense of thematic ambiguity – where Wai doesn’t reveal his choice to portray this particular ensemble of stories – but it’s in this ambiguity that we realize each person is bound by their desire. Wong Kar Wai’s unique visual approach is evident with Days of Being Wild – he fixates on one scene, one character long enough to establish a narrative. Effortlessly, and with very simple cinematography, he bases his complex thematic structures and characters and lets you as a viewer, live the narrative. His background music, acts as a catalyst in forming a jumbled, kaleidoscopic world in your head. The DVD of Days of Being Wild has no extras, no features and not even a trailer. It was a bit of a letdown – and this is a recurring trend in all Wong Kar Wai DVDs, where you only get the film. The subtitles options are aplenty, though – Spanish, French, English and Japanese. Days of Being Wild is charming. It’s not a positive film, and it won’t leave you with particularly simplistic thoughts by the end of it – so be warned. But it’s a charming visual tale, of an assortment of people who deal with basic human emotions in their own personal manner. Watch it not to relate, detach or deduce from the complexities – but just to let the narrative tease your intelligence and play with your head.

Actionn Replayy. For those of you who feel indifferent to anything remotely 70s, you will enjoy the quirky characters, the background score reminiscent of smooth, bluesy rock and the movie will create a world that definitely has a unique character. ","Have you ever wondered what America considered as entertainment before  Keeping up with the Kadarshians? Because “American” has become an adjective, let’s try describing a prototype - the many Paris Hiltons? Rock n Roll (with sex and drugs as backing vocals) or the highway diners, each promising the best steak you’ve ever had, where you’re being served by a single mom, during her day job? Still so, “American culture” is a beaten up phrase, being manifested in way too many ways – some desire it, run after it and some make movies about it. Nashville, The Godfather and Citizen Kane come to mind when we think of quintessentially American movies – either incorporating the American way of life, or discussing political/social changes. Linklater’s 1993 cult film Dazed and Confused doesn’t take on that responsibility – and yet in it’s easy going demeanor it ends up revealing much about America in the 70s.Dazed and Confused is mostly a nostalgic trip, centering around a few teenagers on their last day of school. It has no structure, no plot, no conflict/resolution but it creates a world, which will allow you – sitting in your Monsoon-ridden state in India – to be a part of the 70s in America. These kids, played by now very much older actors (Matthew McConaughey, Jason London, Rory Cochran, Adam Goldberg, Milla Jovovich, Michelle Burke), are rebels in the purest meaning known to them back then. They smoke marijuana like it’s their justification for an adolescent confusion; they dress in a hippie-like rejection of anything authoritarian or capitalist and they listen to music with relevantly guised lyrics wrapped in an edgy electric-guitar consciousness. The movie sifts through scenes and sequences where the regulatory high-school behaviour is depicted – with intensive ragging, sexual and political casualness, and follows the students on their last day as a student. They go through their cannabis-induced grind of easy camaraderie and guilty pleasures – something common for their age. Each teenager’s life is graphed, little by little, as the movie parallels between their individual stories and their relationships with each other. At some point, as a viewer, you are going to wonder, “what next?” but that’s healthy. Dazed and Confused could also be a rejection of anything structuralist, including your idea that the movie should have something concrete. It might not make up for the lack of flow in the film, but because the movie aptly depicts a decade of American culture that is viewed so nostalgically, the rest is forgiven.The 2-disc Criterion edition of Dazed and Confused  contains audition tapes, several deleted scenes, behind-the scenes-footage, interviews and Kahane Corn's one-hour documentary of the ten-year-reunion of the film's cast and crew. The special features provide ample insight to us initiated viewers about why and how this film gained cult status in the US, over the years.This entire journey started when I found out Dazed and Confused was on Tarantino’s list of Top 20 films. When you read the synopsis, you wonder how this film made it to a list that includes films like Battle Royale and Memories of Murder. It can be best explained by McConaughey’s dialogue from the film, “That's what I like about these high school girls; I get older, they stay the same age. Yes they do. Yes they do.”

With about an hour's worth of smiles, laughs and hard-core laughter filled in. All because of fresh dialogue and awesome comic timing. You have to be willing to tolerate the many out of place songs and the ""sheeeeesh"" climax though.","Of course, the theme of friends having fun together is hardly new or ""different"". But if the gags are intentionally funny, fresh or presented with freshness, devoid of toilet humor, and fairly non-adult, I'm in. Doesn't mean that De Taali doesn't have such quips or has a water-tight script. Hardly! Its just that there are ""other"" really funny situations and jokes too. Also, at most times, the humor is situation driven rather than a situation being forced in to accommodate the lines. Another round of applause for the writer because he actually made the girls relevant and funny in the comedy genre. If only they could have sewn it together into a coherent plot. Anyway, the thing about laughing out loud and so hard-n-long that the neighbor gives you a long stare is that you begin to let go your requirements of ""good cinema"". First you suspend your disbelief, then you put your brain to the proverbial rest for a couple of hours, then you give in. Give in to the silliness of it all. Give in to the eccentric side characters and their comic relief sub-plots. It doesn't happen to me too often, but when it does even a couple of those hearty laughs make the movie worth it. However the completely haywire last half hour and the abrupt, casual and ridiculous climax is absolutely unforgivable. Also references to a particular support group are in bad taste and don't go with the otherwise sensitive tone of the movie. Ritesh Deshmukh who plays a-new-plan-a-minute Paresh Gurudev is as good with his comic timing as ever. He actually looks slimmer and sleeker than Ayesha Takia playing the loving, caring Amrita. But being on the ""chubby"" side with almost constantly braided hair makes her character more adorable, more girl-next-door, more ""identifiable with"" type. Its nice to see a female lead not oozing her sexuality on us.Aftab Shivdasani is a pleasant surprise. He is the affluent Abhishek who falls in true love with every other girl he meets. The man actually has the potential to make you smile! In order to bring out contrast between Amrita and Kartika's mysterious character, Rimi Sen is given a tanned, sexy look. She is a revelation too. It is amazing how the women in De Taali show that all they need is a reasonably well written character.I actually liked the fact that we were not entertained to a whole lot of back-story of all the characters. Only that much was revealed about their background as was necessary to move the plot forward. But, this has its own drawbacks. Whenever a particular plot point is disclosed, your mind travels back to when the relevant piece of information was told to you first, and in a way you feel manipulated. I know, it sounds like I'm asking for just the right amount of information that ""I"" want. But doesn't the art lie in making the movie so engaging that these thoughts do not come to my mind while I'm watching it? Overall though, I enjoyed being with the here-and-now of the characters. Especially considering that a possible alternative would be a voiceover reading out each character's resume to acquaint us with them.Yet, I'm sure the movie could've been liked by many more if it had been a good 30 minutes shorter. And though the foot-tapping numbers have decent lyrics and are set to some cool choreography, they are still out of place. Any day, I would prefer fewer songs to a 2 hour+ movie.

Deadline has some really good performances. Konkana Sen Sharma’s act looks so effortlessly done. Her character looks so natural that the viewer forgets that she is in fact acting. Irrfan Khan does yet another grim role with remarkable control. His diction and dialogue delivery is as good as ever. Personally, I would like to see him play a lighter character, before he gets typecast in such parts. Rajit Kapoor and Zakir Hussain do their bit with an apt amount of energy. Sandhya Mridul though, could have done with a little constraint, her expressions and make-up are a tad exaggerated.The story and its execution are the culprits. The main pre-requisite of a movie of this genre is missing if the audience can guess where the story is going in the first half an hour. The whole experience then becomes agonizingly anti-climatic. If the high point of the movie comes in the first quarter, things that would have been given a cinematic license otherwise, become less tolerable - the extra background score, the weird camera movement, the crooked smirks that say, “I know better than thee”. Then there is the usual list of things that are just plain annoying - the product placement, the melodramatic pauses between lines, the obvious loopholes in the story. The good thing about the movie is that it is short and does not have unnecessary sub-plots.Same set of actors, similar story, may-be even the same director, but a different screenplay could have made this movie much more watchable.

","You are writing a letter to life. You start, “Dear Zindagi,” (Dear life). Obviously, you are going to end up philosophizing a lot. And that's exactly what the film does too. It tries to weave that into a story of a young, confused, urban girl. But, we know it is all a metaphor and Dear Zindagi actually wants to talk to you. Ironically, this is where it loses all connect with you. Given Shah Rukh Khan is doing a lot of the pep talk, you'd think the connect is lost because of is all-knowing smirk. It's not. In fact, for most parts you look at him and hear him as Jehangir Khan. And it really is great when this happens. Alia Bhatt too is her usual refreshing self, even when her character is reflecting on the big doses of philosophy being thrown her way. However, the confused, urban girl and her problems are only as interesting as a confused, urban girl's problems can be. Sure, I want her to sort herself out and see her life beyond her problems. But, I don't want to sit with her through her therapy sessions. This is not apathy, it is a  response to jerky screenplay and a protagonist whose problems that I understand but don't engage with.At first glance, you could say you feel the disconnect because Kaira seems to be living a pretty decent life  - good at her work, good friends, romantic attention from the kind of guys she likes. “She has no problem”, you might want to say, “What do I root for?” Herein lies Dear Zindagi's agenda. It is ok for you to be unhappy even if most things are going your way. There is no need to be hard on yourself, it says. It is a noble enough cause, one that propagates  – we ought to be comfortable with ourselves even when we are unhappy. Unfortunately, to make a fictional film, it needs solid characters with an engaging story that binds them together. And to acknowledge that a poor joke is poor or a deep philosophical quote is a too deep, doesn't make either of those less tacky. Kaira's character is totally imaginable as a girl you'd know, the kind who uses her rudeness on her sleeve while it actually is a coping mechanism of sorts. She has her reasons to be that way, but Dear Zindagi shows them to you too late to be able to fit the complicated puzzle that Kaira makes herself out to be. I am glad that we know very little about Jehangir Khan. He's a therapist who seems to know what he is doing. And that is pretty much all we need to know. And the unique chemistry between Kaira and Jehangir is played out well by the two actors too. The disoriented feeling then comes from the breaks into Kaira's life, her friends, etc. It is a little too plain, a little too long, a little too repetitive. A crisper, even if not a more enticing, slice of her life would have had a better impact. Dear Zindagi is one of those very few films that start out drab and pick up steam in the second half. While it is nice to have a well-founded set-up, if it is dull it becomes even more difficult for the story to hook you. It is a shame then that a film that had all the right things to say; that had capable actors to say them the right way; that had characters who could have kept your thoughts from going astray doesn't do it all too well. It is a film different from the norm which by itself wins some points, but  not quite enough.

Want to close your eyes when a scarred, creepy stalker bangs into a car filled with women just for fun? All of this will be coupled in a worn out print with jarring scratches, with jump cuts, jumping god knows how many frames, cheeky background score, colourful, edgy cinematography and you’ll be left wanting to disapparate into a seedy theatre during the 1970s, where you could sit and watch a film like Death Proof  with sexual explicitness and violence galore – to awaken your senses. ","Just-about-the-right shade of big yellow typeface, familiar names like Sally Menke and Eli Roth, background music that injects a combination of exhilaration and pumped-up-ness – all, ironically, contribute to a comfortable few minutes of the opening credits of a Tarantino film. You know what you’re in for, with smart, uninhibited layers of homage, film after film. Tarantino will mix up the most ruggedly available genres and serve on a platter to you, a rare delicacy of intelligent, loud, bordering on arrogant (who’s complaining) colourful and intoxicant-coated meaty cinema.Excuse the jumbled words; it’s all that comes to mind after watching the Grindhouse Series.
Grindhouse is a double feature, with Death Proof directed by Quentin Tarantino and Planet Terror by Robert Rodriguez. The series is a throwback to the 1970s exploitation cinema, with sex, violence and gore as an integral part of the thematic structure. Death Proof has all the regular ingredients: scantily clad, gutsy women, sudden violence, coupled with a quirky and eclectic soundtrack that is a typical Tarantino trademark. 
Tarantino’s half features a story around 2 groups of women, one in Austin, Texas and a year later in Lebanon, Tennessee and how they separately battle out a serial killer, Stuntman Mike. Mike stalks beautiful women and brutally murders them in his car. The film follows various conversations of the sassy women and their plans, intercutting with Stuntman Mike’s perspective of the women and their banter.
The pace is distracting; with the slow conversations that require you to observe and listen so you can understand the characters better and heart-in-your-throat car sequences where you can see Stuntman Mike gruel it out with the “powerpuff girls” (Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms and Zoe Bell), but it all boils down to a 2 hour experience that entertains in a way that makes you want to be a part of the movie.
The best part about Death Proof are the minute details that make you feel like the only thing missing in your movie watching experience is actually sitting in a theatre during the 1970s, on a deserted American Highway with seedy people beside you. The film includes faux scratches in the worn-out print; deliberately digitized audio wobbles and jump cuts that almost make you sit up, high-contrast cinematography and intervals of film trailers of non-existent movies from the same genre. 
Tarantino spends so much time on establishing the characters via long, rapid-fire conversations that you feel like an additional member on the table. You simultaneously want to wing a very heavy shoe at Stuntman Mike, just for being downright creepy. 
The DVD has an array of interesting features, including a poster gallery of trailers and posters of movies like Planet Terror, 1408, a documentary feature of stuntmen and women from the film called Stunts on Wheels: The Legendary Drivers of Death Proof, Finding Quentin’s Gals, an interview with Tarantino and his casting options for the film and a snippet on stuntwomen Zoe Bell, who also features in the film.
Contrary to its image, Death Proof is the perfect film for a pajama party night with the girls. With fleeting car actions, tangy background score, in depth exploration of a the dynamics of extreme characters in far-fetched, graphic novel type situations and a mesh of referential paybacks, Death Proof is like an indulgent account of Tarantino’s unabashed ideas sandwiched into a delirious world.

The setting of Aparna Sen's 36, Chowringhee Lane (1981) is Calcutta in the early eighties, where an old and lonely Anglo-Indian woman copes with changing times and declining relationships. The backdrop of A Death in the Gunj (2016) is McCluskiegunj, a (real) place in erstwhile Bihar. Gunj, as it is referred to in the film's title, was once a home to 300 Anglo-Indian families, most of who left India after World War II. If Wikipedia is to be believed, descendants of only twenty families still 'remain' in this quaint little idyllic habitat.It is December 1978 and McCluskiegunj is rustic, unkempt and decaying. The ground is covered with dried leaves. The sky is murky. The daylight is pale. Amidst this ambiance stands an isolated colonial bungalow owned by the Sharmas (played by the charismatic Om Puri and Tanuja). Surrounded by layers of foliage, the Sharma abode is replete with an outhouse, sprawling back and front yards, a couple of verandahs, a fireplace, and many twin-shuttered creaking doors and glass windows. Its teak furniture complements the ceramic, glass and steel cutlery. A washed-out checkered table cloth is spread in between the two, to set them apart. Lit only by dappled sunlight, the rooms might feel a little damp during the day. At night, they glow in tungsten light, while the surroundings remain shrouded in the dark. The spooky setting brings about a sense of foreboding, which the characters only intensify with their youthful but mischievous antics.At this time i.e. in the December of 1978, the house is crowded with Sharmas' guests -- their children (a young couple with a daughter) and extended family (a nephew, and children's common friends). All adults. Their interpersonal dynamics is unraveled slowly, through playful interactions -- banter and practical jokes, picnics, and lunches, all of which suggest a shared childhood and deep familiarity with each other. The cinematographer has washed the setting and characters in faint light, thus creating low-contrast visuals, which you will take a while to get used to. But once you do, McCluskiegunj may feel like home. Or at least reminiscent of one. That's the kind of old-world charm it creates. So much so that the place and atmosphere stay in memory longer than the story or the characters.For me, neither the story, nor the characters create an impact. The characters seem stereotyped. A macho guy, a damsel, a weakling, a bullish elder cousin, a caring maasi, and some more. Kudos to the actors who have embodied them and have played out the quirks as if they were their own. However, in spite of that and even though the focus is largely on character interactions, the costumes, and accessories, facial hair and wigs, sometimes drew too much attention. One cannot help but notice how well or not well is a particular actor carrying the period get-up. Then, the language – part Bangla, part English that the characters speak, I just couldn't relate to it. It could very well have been entirely in Bengali or in English, but combining both seemed like a feeble effort in capturing the regionality. It felt that not just the film’s setting but the very sensibility informing the film belongs to yesteryears. Of late, achieving a regional flavor by embracing the local dialect has become the mainstay of our films, and many recent films prove it, e.g. Gangs of Wasseypur, Nil Battey Sannata, Haramkhor, Dangal, etc.The bilingual aspect is also very reminiscent of Aparna Sen's English films. Add to it the grammar of slow unraveling plot, gradual, even if, minuscule increase in tension, and a strongly contrasting peak, almost as if a pebble was thrown in a placid lake, whose waters had only known the ripples caused by the summer breeze, the similarities with Aparna Sen's storytelling increase. All this makes Konkona Sensharma's craft seem so heavily influenced by Aparna Sen's that this might as well be her mother's earlier film, that too sans a tight emotional grip.From Konkona, I was hoping for a cinematic language that was more outgoing, maybe experimental, but not necessarily confined to the safe zone of constructed realism. Maybe bold, just like the roles she has played. Maybe more ordinary, but more real. But definitely, one that reflected her knowledge of a wider variety of cinema. I also hoped for a story that resonated with current times, something more topical, something that speaks of how she sees the world around her. But then, I also know that if she had done any of these, and had she failed to engross the audience, the critics would have gone after her for not doing justice to the legacy she carries.Maybe, her future films will carry a sensibility that is neither Sen nor Sharma, only Konkana. For now, what we have got is just old scotch in a new bottle, which is obviously not meant for an audience looking for instant gratification. It takes the time to grow on you. It asks you to sit and watch its effects unfold on you, mulling over with every sip. If this kind of cinema interests you, watch it in theaters. Otherwise wait for its Amazon Prime release, which happens to be its official streaming partner.

Visuals of city streets at night, of skyscrapers lit up like Christmas candles, of plush hotel rooms cloaked in anonymous neon, unfortunately a noir film do not make.  What a film like this requires is a clever, well developed script, and believable characters.  There are three main characters: the nerdy accountant who leads a life so dull and colorless that watching numbers scroll on his laptop gives him the biggest thrill (there is a horrible line where he says that it is all about order and symmetry, really!). A cool, smooth, assured man of the world oh so fit and physical. And the femme fatale, all golden blond locks, long legs, and pouty mouth.  The characters remain superficial; the script does not help us understand their peculiar idiosyncrasies nor their motivations.  They seem to have been specifically brought to life so that a film could be made.  The first part of the film has the accountant and the man of the world coming together, and then a very obvious screenplay twist is made to account for the transformation of the accountant’s world.  And then it gets worse, every cliché is played out, and the film rambles towards the climax.  Now, here is where the director could have kept it short and taut, the climax that is.  Unfortunately he is undecided whether he should wrap things up neatly; throw in a revenge angle, or have a feel good ending.  He ends up having a little bit of everything, which really spoils it all.  The climax is unconvincing, and feels very stretched.  A good noir film works when it transports everyday characters into a world that is not so obvious; a world that lurks just around the next corner in the mean streets of the city.  For that the script has to have a good build up and create characters that we can believe in.  Here what we have is caricatures rather than characters, and that just wrecks the film.  Both Jackman and Ewan McGregor seem to have done the film only for the money and nothing else.  The actress playing the femme fatale has nothing to do but look good and alternate between tears and laughter.  The only good thing for me was to see the delightful Charlotte Rampling on screen in a brief cameo.  I wonder what she was doing there, though!

Only a few spots you wish were polished a tad better.","There are seven stages of falling in love claims Dedh Ishqiya. Isn't it beautiful that the director is in love, the writer is in love, the cinematographer is in love, the producer is in love and of course, the actors are in love - with their art? They are almost at the sixth stage - obsession. Lovingly, balancing their act before they go any further towards the climax. And the beauty is they take you along with them, only leaving you behind once in a way. With all its Urdu (I refuse to use any glorifying adjective for Urdu because it just doesn't do justice), poetry and poise, the one thing that strikes the most is its quirkiness. Who would've thought Urdu and quirk would blend so well together. A character who doesn't even have a scene in the film has a quirky dying wish. The contrast doesn't stop here. You have a foul-mouthed Babban (Arshad Warsi), a loud-mouthed Muniya (Huma Qureshi) and wannabe poet (Vijay Raaz) even it out with their everyday speak. Further enhancing these opposites are the subtitles in English. At first annoying, but once the Urdu begins you are grateful for them. And yet, the Urdu isn't completely out there. You can approximate what the not so known words mean from the context. Very likely, the writers took a conscious decision to dumb it down for us. A wise decision which balances between becoming too intelligent for its own good and over-explaining things. There are a couple of spots where they couldn't resist spoon-feeding though and it is jarring when it happens only because it departs from the otherwise painstakingly created regal tone of the film. The rusty, dusty palette against the royal backdrop of a prince's palace is by itself enough to keep you engaged for a good part of the film. The music subtly stays in the background with some soulful lyrics to the songs. This works perfectly for the story that adds layer after layer to itself. I loved the subtle hints at homosexuality - both good and bad. Then, each of the main characters has an angle of his/her own. The build-up to half-time is perfect for the twists that ensue later in the film. Interestingly, even if it is predictable you don't mind it, because it is still different from the norm. Similarly, the wit in the lines, even when predictable is done with words that you don't expect making it fresh. Of course, it helps that you have a cast that insists on topping each other in terms of their charm, comic timing, dialogue delivery and poise as needed. Sure, you will find Madhuri Dixit a little less glamorous and vibrant than she was in her heyday. But the lady is aging gracefully. That beside the role does demand a plastic kind of poise that she carries off with elegance. And when she lets her hair down, she reminds you of her old self.Naseeruddin Shah is lovable as the old fool in love, smitten by his latest ""love of life"". And yet he carries of the shade of gray believably. Arshad Warsi is of course, charming from the word go as a gullible idiot. Huma Qureshi has now mastered the art of being the woman who knows exactly what she wants. Vijay Raaz too is perfect as the villain who is as smitten as our protagonist. All of them - from Madhuri Dixit to Vijay Raaz need more roles like these. For our sakes more than theirs.  And for our sake too, if there is a Dhai Ishqiya, I am not sure if I want it to stay at this stage of love - a little less than six out of the full seven. A part of me wants the next installment to go all out and challenge us with zero spoon-feeding. A part of me wants it to stick to this balance.  Why? Well, because the seventh stage is rather deadly.

A personal diary - each page an observation about life and its people. Angst against everything that's wrong with this world. A mirror held up to society - not to reflect its filth but to spot that we are the cause and effect of our discontent and discord. What is Delhi-6? A bit of them all. And not any one thing in entirety.It's not the journey of a non-resident Indian visiting India. You see the world through his eyes. It's not about one particular pin (zip) code area. It is a slice of any town. It is not about a religious divide nor is it about unity. All of which translates to this - it doesn't have a story in the traditional sense of the term. This is the beauty of the film. Even the main characters are not really full-blown protagonists. You know them slightly more than you know the other 15 side-characters. Without a concrete story it very gradually creates an appealing environment. But at half-time, you are still in the ""okay, NOW the movie will start"" mode. This can be a frustrating experience unless you give yourself up to the edgy-choppy style of story-telling. In fact, the first two distinct and abrupt sequences tell you to prepare yourself for 2-3 threads and to draw parallels between them. And analogies there are aplenty. Some of them are as in-the-face as they are sudden. The abrupt cuts and background music, though brilliant, were too distracting for me to let go completely. I felt like I'm snooping in on somebody's daily journal and it felt mighty uncomfortable as if I'm intruding their privacy. Most of us are aware of the standard philosophy spouted through the movie. Yet, we can enjoy the understated way in which it is being told. Except in the end, that is. It's like the writers got anxious, ""what if the audience doesn't catch on to the subtlety?"" Let us spell it out for them: m-e-s-s-a-g-e. Very intentionally the writers are writing a book that doesn't necessarily have to be read back-to-back. You can flip open a page, read, digest or not, close and open at another random page. Like it doesn't matter to them that one thread is left unresolved.  Same goes for the songs and their abrupt placement. However, 'dafatan' is one of the best picturized songs I've seen in a long time. Not only because of the imagination and the technical creativity but also because it takes you into the character's mindset. He in turn, is representative of how we as a race want the best of all our worlds to come together. The details within each sequence, like dialogues, interactions are not ground-breaking but not fatal either. There are a few brilliant lines amongst the blah sexual innuendos. And by the way, just in case you Dilli-wallas or hard-core desis take offence, you are told often enough that you are good at heart, so just listen to that bit, ok? The undercurrent is more important - the contradictions, the double standards, the bickering, the human tendency to reconcile when in need. Brothers fight like cats. But when the need arises they can be a part of a community against ""outsiders"". Two communities fight. But when there is something that endangers both they can unite to conquer the deemed-common enemy. That which divides to rule can unite too, such is the extent of our inconsistencies. And this can be extrapolated to any other relationship or issue. Such comments on how things work today are strewn across the movie. The amused look Roshan (Abhishek Bachchan) wears on his introduction to India was extremely heartening. It was neither demeaning nor patronizing. Abhishek isn't required to do anything out of the ordinary, but overpowering the likes of Waheeda Rahman must certainly not have been an easy task. As much credit to Waheedaji especially in that particular scene for succumbing to the situation. Sonam Kapoor has a charming screen presence and makes the best of the limited range this role offers. The best bit of casting is Atul Kulkarni though. I for one wanted to see him in a not-so-serious role. He captures Gobar's submissiveness and hypocrisy.  Such movies are made with the intention of evoking the audience's inner voice. That's a tall order. Lectures pass   right through my 4-year old's entire system, so I'd conclude we are conditioned to ignore them. Then, even if you have a character point out and say, ""don't sermonize us"", it doesn't make it any less of a speech. And that's where the director lost me as an audience. Nothing is moved to evoke emotion, let alone invoke anything from within. Equality-humanity-yadi-yada-yawwwwn. A little off-mark for the man who has given us radical climaxes - like them or not. The pace and length could be an issue for some of us. But, we shouldn't miss the fact that it is courageous to attempt a general description of life. I enjoyed the nuances, the hints, and the less blatant bits of commentary on society. That was enough for me to forget and partially forgive the need for a lucid three-act plot.

And that's exactly what Delhi Belly is - hip. It might not have umpteen cool ways to turn the camera, but it is right up there with Gen X in its slang and attitude. In its way,  Delhi Belly is Dil Chahta Hai for a generation that's 10 years younger - where women might also enjoy a guy film as much as the guy next to her, laughing his guts out. Oh yeah, and don't take your parents for this one. ","Delhi Belly picks its genre and sticks to it. It's as if a generation is standing up to say, ""Call us pulp or dark, crass or gross. This is how we are - take it or leave it."" He/she could be the common youth on the street, sitting beside you in a theater, a new age director or a producer gracing you with an appearance in the end credits. The three roommates are representatives of a young, urban India who are trying to break the shackles binding them to what was considered a ""normal"" life. They, along with their friends, are the latest breed of graduates - not necessarily from art, science or commerce - from alternate fields, like media and hospitality. And there is this other thing that happens to them - shit. They deal with it. By hook or by crook, they see their way through it. They are far from sophisticated, because they care a damn. In fact, they have no qualms about driving you to nausea. But they take care of themselves.  Recently we have seen a whole lot of films in this genre. Where a bunch of innocent people (mere bystanders, even) get into trouble unawares, and destiny somehow puts the puzzle of 3-5 parallel stories together. Delhi Belly has that skin but from within its unpretentious. It has no inhibitions whatsoever, be it toilet humor, obscenities, violence, vulgarity or sex. I loved its focus on making its audience laugh using their language. I most certainly missed a few jokes because loud laughter, from a previous line, didn’t' die in time. Delhi Belly doesn't try to act smart by saying, ""Try, and figure me out if you can"" Or ""keep pace with me if you can"". Keeps it simple (please admire my restraint), it does. The flip side of course, is that the characters don't get too much attention. In keeping the story simple, the characters are one-dimensional. The performances though come to the characters' rescue. They are so brilliant that I didn't have to think about how one was acting or overacting or not. In fact, Vijay Raaz and his gang are caricatured and seem a little out-of-place and yet, they pass  by without causing irritation. Well, I guess it's because they are led by Vijay Raaz, after all. Well, a movie that can nail it all would've been a different movie, right? For example, how I wish they'd avoided a couple of extraneous sub-plots. Anyway, the way it is, there's so much going on in the background music, the props and the dialogue that it becomes a bit overwhelming. Delhi Belly makes no over-imposing statements, no grand messages. (That's a change from the typical Aamir Khan product.) It's just one young film. It was fun watching it with my favorite people - the 600+ filmaniacs who not only show up but also whistle and hoot at 8.15 AM. Let's just say like every dabangg has its audience, every Delhi Belly does too. And there must be a lucky bunch whose tastes include both. Ps. Oh yeah, I told you right? I'd recommend you keep your parents away from this one. That you liked Delhi Belly, by itself might be a bit of a cultural shock to them. Which also means if you are conservative in your taste in films, you should stay away. Confession: I goofed-up. I watched the English version. I have a feeling the real deal is in Hindi. I'll try to catch up with the Hindi version and update you on what works better.

But writing in terms of both plot and dialogue are huge let downs. ","Delhi Safari's animation is by far the most superior I've seen in Hindi films. But, at it's heart it is a true-blue  Bollywood film, where people are convinced to go against their will using songs. And if there aren't people to be convinced, characters can still break into song. The writing gets random even when there are no songs. Animals from a jungle set out to teach humans a bit of humanity. It looks like writer/director Nikhil Advani wasn't convinced that this basic one-line plot wouldn't convert into a feature length film. Almost an hour of Delhi Safari is a road film where the animals travel from Mumbai to Delhi to talk to government officials about displacement from their jungle. The road film part of Delhi Safari then becomes a series of detours into either songs or endless bickering between Bajrang, a monkey (Govinda) and Alex, a parrot (Akshaye Khanna). Govinda is his typical loud self. Akshaye Khanna's the only voice which seems to be moderated to fit the animation genre. And Boman Irani as Bagga, the bear at times does that. The rest of the cast sound exactly like themselves and that is more distracting than entertaining or engaging, especially Urmila Matondkar as Begum, a cheetah. I'm not sure we can even blame the voice artists because they are barely given dialogue that is specific to animals. The story is set with animals, but they make pop-culture references with a ton of inspiration from Lion Kingand know way too much about human world. And it's not like their situation had any dearth of making animals behave like animals would. If there is any doubt left, it is wiped out with Alex's preachy monologue.Fortunately, the detailing in the animation of the main characters' bodies are really done well. The hair and the animals' movements are created with great attention. 3D too is used really well with stones and dust being thrown our way in the opening sequence. Another sequence where a roller coaster effect has been created is great too. And there are others where the opportunity feels untapped like the flamingo dance or the hyena joint. Other than that, the background, the lip movements while dialogue delivery and in general creativity in developing an atmosphere have a long way to go. Another question that lingers is who is the target audience. Like I suspected, the story line and dialogue seems to be directed towards adults who can relate to the references (including a scene that implies the character is a casting couch) but the rest of the execution looks like it is geared towards kids. Yet, this is a step in the right direction as far as animation, especially 3D animation go in Hindi films. And for that it needs to be encouraged. If only, they didn't take the writing department for granted, I could have done so with a  little more heart.

Even if you don't get the language the cast is so expressive without over-doing it that you'd enjoy it. And as usual some brilliant cinematography by Umesh Kulkarni's team.,"I could watch Deool just the play of light and shade in each of its frame. And this is even more amazing considering the film is set in a village where many a time there's no electrical power and the only source of light is an oil lamp or sometimes just the stars and the moon. Even if I didn't realize how beautiful it is shot, I could watch it just for the village simpletons. Their faces and bodies so expressive, these are true actors each one of them, as if there was no camera in front of them, and I was just observing people from a village where my grandparents live. And yet, Deool has so, so much to offer. So what if it is a little less metaphorical than director, Umesh Kulkarni's earlier venture and so what if it had a couple of avoidable ""commercial"" elements? I enjoyed the ride that Deool took me on. Deool is about the transformation of Mangrul, a village in the remotest interiors of Maharashtra. It is a satirical journey of Mangrul's belief in religion and the blind faith that accompanies it. And Mangrul is only a representation of the common population, us. Deool argues about the definition of development in a village that is so behind that basic necessities like water and electricity are missing in action. Is it so bad then if the village gets these simple needs by using blind faith as a stepping stone? Though I'm not sure Deool stays non-judgmental it sure does a good job of presenting both sides. Deool talks about capitalism and business in religion; it showcases the strength of women and at the same time the hypocrisy of the political system all in one breath. And all of this is narrated fluidly. The sedentary village and its laid-back residents go from one event to another and before you realize that you know the characters and their quirks, their intentions and motivations. This is as much a result of the immaculate dialogue-writing as it is the way/dialect in which it's delivered. And this is even though I watched a non-subtitled version. I surely must've missed out on a few punch lines. The actors take entertainment to the next level. Even the exaggerated tones seem acceptable because they make you laugh so hard. There were at least a couple of scenes where my mouth was wide open because of the ridiculous way in which things were unfolding - because I knew this could so happen in my village too. There were a few other scenes which created beautiful and/or insightful moments. I especially enjoyed the exchanges between Nana Patekar and Dilip Prabhavalkar. Mentioning just these two names is a huge disservice to the rest of the cast, but the list is so long and every villager that comes on screen leaves an impression. Let me also quickly add that there were a couple of scenes where Nana Patekar overdid it. But, that hardly took away from the film. That doesn't mean that there were no eliminable elements at all because at 2.5 hours, Deool is a little too long. Also a tad disappointing is the introduction of ""commercial"" elements in an Umesh Kulkarni film. Is Umesh succumbing? Because it is not only about an item number and a cameo by a ""bigger"" Hindi actor. Those we can, this once, grant benefit of doubt to, under the cloak of ""the need of the script"". But, he also seems to have gone that extra mile to explain the metaphors and not left it to his usual subtle style. But hey, I don't mind a little commerce with my art. Deool in many ways is Valu - Part 2. It carries the same tone and texture AND it leaves a tiny ""not as good as"" the first part feel. Yet, it is a wholesome and entertaining experience.

204,302,302,302,302,Department,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma reviewNotepad38 Critic Reviews 0.1/5.0 1 Reader Review 3/5.0 8 Tweet Reviews 1.3/5.0,/movie/department-review/,0.1/5.0,3/5.0,1.3/5.0,2.2,"The perennial ""right vs. wrong"" debate is put up against a new-sounding ""Smartness vs 'an A-Rated word'"". This complex debate soon becomes incomprehensible as characters become more and more ambiguous. Vague characters can be interesting but the experimentation with the camera is too distracting for anything else to be processed satisfactorily. ","You see a politician frustrated with the system so corrupt that it doesn't allow justice the way it should be. You see him find a solution. You see him set up a department to blatantly kill everyone they know to be guilty, without any heed to legality. You see the potential this story has to handle something so controversial. You hold off on a smirk when you see that this department will be called....""Department""! Except that you see all of this in the weirdest angles and camera positions imaginable. You want to call it imaginative and ambivalently end up wishing that no one had imagined it at all. Because the histrionics of the camera rob you of anything half-decent that the film potentially had.It hurts to discredit someone for trying to be creative. But the fact remains that, that spurt of ingenuity didn't work one bit. And believe me, experience has taught me to brace myself, as I would in a roller coaster ride, when entering a RGV film - even the ones produced by him, let alone directed by the man himself. I'd have felt less annoyed if the non-standard camera work had a directorial purpose in terms of characters or situations that it's used for. But nothing of that sort happens. The coolness fact ends with, ""I wonder where the camera is as this striker is moving about the carrom board or as this tea-pan is being taken to the cup for the tea to be strained."" If there was something symbolic that I missed, it was not for want of trying. Department is full of quirky characters and performances. And some of the characters are interesting too, mainly because they do carry a few shades of gray despite being in the business of killing people. But none of the grayness is taken further, you are just tempted into the den with it and left there in the darkness of a regular underworld story. The now boring nexus of business and crime called politics, crime and business of politics, and the politics and business in crime - now that's a RGV tweet in the making! That's what some of the dialogue in the film sounds like too - right out of the director's twitter timeline. Yet, there are moments, especially with Amitabh Bachchan on screen where you feel like respite is coming your way. His character's (Sarjerao) enigma is charming right through the end. So much so that if that is what it is going to be about, I don't mind a Department 2,even if I'm bound to be disappointed. Sarjerao's quirkiness makes you laugh out loud. I actually waited with bated breath when it felt like he was going to advocate drinking alcohol, much in the 'daaru peene se liver kharaab...' vein. But alas, nothing of that epic sort happens, or even mini epics. Instead, you are left wondering what was the point of that scene. And many, many more such scenes come and go that are disconnected with the film by itself. The rest is a criss-cross of crossers, double-crossers. Again the regular sort, nothing that you haven't seen earlier in a gangwar film. There is one issue I've always had with use of child actors in violent films. Department has many violent chase sequences where children shown in passing. Not a child is bothered by the shooting going on, they continue to play on ball. Even if the intent is to show how we are desensitizing our children to violence, I can't help but shudder every time I see an actual child in a scene like that - made to act indifferent to the violence around him/her. Irrespective of that, Department had the chance to make us see both sides of any solution that we choose for our degenerating systems. But, the makers chose to focus on camera gimmickry rather than build on the premise it chose. The stuff that you see in any underworld film are done to death, the new stuff makes you wish they hadn't tried and the things in between, they didn't explore to its fullest.

205,303,303,303,303,[The] Descendants,Owner's Pride!,wogma review5 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/descendants-review/,,5/5.0,,3.2,"George Clooney in the first 5 minutes of The Descendants says via a voiceover, “I am the backup parent, the understudy”, and immediately you know this is going to be a coming of age film, which is ironical considering the film spans over 10 days. To be able to turn things around convincingly, in a story that encompasses that time frame, is no easy job. The film manages to inculcate in you, the same values that the Rajshri’s have been trying for generations (coupled with a darling of a story). This time around, with The Descendants, Alexandre Payne makes the job seem effortless and manages to tug your heart. ","Forgive my comparison, but this year The Descendants has almost taken on the same avatar as last year’s little gem, The King’s Speech i.e. a feel good film that brightens your day and also, wins all the movie awards. While the films are widely apart in their premise, the one thing you can be certain of is that it will be one of the most emotionally captivating films you would have seen till date. The beauty of The Descendants lies in its exterior – the visual picture gives you no clue about the journey you’re about to take with the film. With the backdrop of the serene and beach-y Hawaiian islands, the film tracks Matt King (Clooney) and his family’s journey as the family tries to cope with a great loss. They are also left with a large plot of land from their ancestors: a non-touristy, beautiful piece of the island that King, as the sole trustee of the land, has to decide the outcome of. They lose the lease in 7 years. King and his two daughters set the ball rolling as a perfectly dysfunctional family. Along with the land decisions, a tragedy occurs in the family when his wife hits her head rather hard in a boating accident. This leaves King alone with his children while the wife is in coma. And that is not the only tragedy.Clooney as Matt King is emotionally defensive; however the elder daughter Alex (the radiant Shailene Woodley) has troubles with alcohol and a general adolescent angst. The other daughter Scottie (Amara Miller, also the cutest of the lot) deals with her own personal rebellion of the absence of a mother figure. Both young actors are sassy and have a cracking chemistry that serve as a funny sidetrack from the serious business. They are all running in different directions and you almost want to sit them down and comfort them separately. Such is the first quarter of the film, which fills you with concern and frustration as an empathetic viewer. It’s not a complimentary bond, and therefore you wonder about placing a film that deals with the sense of loss and rejection in a locale that oozes tranquility. However, the Hawaiian island serves as a perfect catalyst for such a setting. Director of photography, Phedon Papamichael brings out this conflict beautifully. For every emotionally heavy scene, the following cut-away has a sense of hope and calm. The background music is almost surreal; country music coupled with part soothing, part peppy Hawaiian vocals that you would imagine playing in a beach shack. This entire package plays out as an oxymoron, bringing out with even more conviction the brewing storm in every character’s head. Clooney is a charm, as the virtual torchbearer of the film, playing single dad in mostly a pair of plain polo t-shirts and colorful Bermuda shorts. He himself asks you not to take the get up seriously; most influential people in the city dress down and casual. We see CEOs in the same avatar; even in a scene when Clooney breaks serious news to his extended family, they’re wearing floral dresses and shirts. This becomes a beautiful routine in the film – between the windy palm trees, floral wear and Hawaiian music you experience a deep familial connect with the story. A shout out to the other characters in the film that grow on you immensely – Robert Forster as Elizabeth’s (the wife) father is temperamental and scenes between him and the rest of the family are all nerve and smiles. Another special mention is of older daughter Alex’s boyfriend (Nick Krause) who is hilariously annoying, and manages to win your heart with his goofy-ness. Clooney’s subtle character growth goes in tandem with the sometimes humorous, sometimes deep narrative. It’s a character-driven story that manages to beautifully weave into an intelligent and expressive film. Each subsidiary character brings something extra to the table, as you connect with their personal voice in the film (you cry along with Scottie when she is told about her mother, you want to tell Alex to be a bit more sensitive to her dad who is dealing with his own baggage and suchlike). Don’t miss The Descendants, as you accompany the film on its path to self-discovery with a warm story.

208,306,306,306,306,Despicable Me,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review6 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/despicable-me-review/,,3/5.0,,2.35,"Despicable Me, the first 3D animated film from Universal Studios, is a fairly entertaining watch, with its main protagonist Gru masterfully voiced by Steve Carell. Although it’s got a predictable storyline, the film has enough moments for you to go ‘awww’.","Three things strike you immediately when you take a look at the DVD of Despicable Me:
1. The cover design is fantastic. 2. There are no special features on the DVD. 3. The sub-title of the film, ‘Superbad. Superdad’, pasted alongside a ‘gru-some’ looking man and three cute kids - almost gives the plot away.Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), an obnoxious inhabitant in a quiet neighbourhood, has an army of minions (egg-shaped characters with voices exactly like that of Vodafone’s Zoozoos) and a mad scientist helping him steal famous monuments. Well, almost. One day, when the Pyramids get stolen by Vector (Jason Segel), a new villain on the block, Gru is intimidated and plans to make the ultimate robbery - shrink the moon and bring it to earth. To help him succeed, Gru adopts three orphaned kids - Margo, Edith and Agnes. Almost from the moment the kids enter Gru’s life, the storyline gets extremely predictable. Several films, especially in animation, have gone down this pat. Monsters Inc., Ice Age are some examples that immediately come to mind. But despite knowing what to expect, Despicable Me is a fairly entertaining watch. This is Universal Studios’ first 3D animated film and although it’s not a Pixar product, the character design and animation is noteworthy. Some sequences - like the rollercoaster scene at the theme park - would look spectacular in 3D, nevertheless are enjoyable on DVD. But Gru's unique character piqued our curiosities the first time we saw the trailers and for many, that took us to the theaters too. Carell is fantastic as Gru and one can’t help but marvel at the immense work that must have gone behind getting the French accent right. So Gru does not sound like Steve Carell, rather it is the other way around. By any standards, that’s an achievement in voiceovers - something we marvelled at when we saw Robin Williams skillfully do it in Mrs Doubtfire. Writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul more or less succeed in showing Gru’s desperation to go to the moon, through his flashbacks to childhood. The humour in the film has a pattern - the antics of the minions are slapstick, while the kids, especially Agnes (Elsie Fisher) generate ‘awww’ moments with every line. Given the basic plot, parents will find certain scenes very easy to relate to mainly because of some parenting lessons Gru learns along the way. The closing sequence brings a smile to your face for simple joy it gives to celebrate the character of Gru. He looks, well... erm...disproportionate, but when in good company, he can dance really well. Later, if you nitpick your brain as to why Despicable Me didn’t floor you completely, there’s an important realisation. Animation films have clearly set the bar so high in quality entertainment, that not every film is going to match up (Many are trying, that’s a good thing.) But it would be fair to say that without drawing too many comparisons, Gru and the kids’ antics are far better value for money than most movies that released this year.

Despicable Me 2 doesn’t quite thrill you as much as you would have liked, but the minions ensure that you’re always entertained!","The last time we met ‘super-villain’ Gru and his minions, they were planning to steal the moon, until Gru’s paternal instincts act as a speed-breaker when three little orphan girls enter his life. Well, you can’t make that up. Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin return with the sequel to their 2010 hit Despicable Me, and though Despicable Me 2 is quite some fun as well, what it really misses is the sheer audacity in plot, something that the first film thrived on.Gru has been settling in with his paternal duties nicely, until an organization named the Anti Villain League attempt to recruit him by sending his way one of their agents, Lucy Wilde. They want Gru to help them identify and nab a new super-villain. And what better way to catch one super-villain than pitting him against another, is their rationale. As with most animation films, Despicable Me 2 is fast-paced, superbly executed and yes, packed with laughs. The characters – Gru, Lucy and Gru’s three girls Agnes, Edith and Margo – win your hearts. Combined with some intriguing shot design and the usual top-notch animation, the film makes sure you’re watching it keenly right till the end. And of course, the highlight, once again, are Gru’s minions; those adorable yellow creatures with a penchant for finding innovative ways to crash, bang and burn. Mostly voiced by the directors themselves, over the years they’ve become something of an internet phenomenon as well, and despite facing stiff competition from the characters mentioned earlier, they quite simply steal the film from under their noses.Where Despicable Me 2 falters is that it neither promises nor delivers a good enough payoff to take away from it – the film doesn’t remain with you for very long after the lights come back on. The plot is too plain, too predictable and proceeds without too many twists to bother you along the way. Fun, yes, but Despicable Me 2 just doesn’t have enough thrills to have you truly hooked.Steve Carell reprises his Gru, and is expectedly great with his zany accent. He manages to make the character his own so much that you can almost imagine Carell sitting somewhere with a hooked nose in front of a microphone. Kristen Wiig and Benjamin Bratt voice the two primary new characters that join the cast – Lucy Wilde and super-villain El Macho respectively, and they’re fine as well, though I don’t think they’ve added any extra spice to their characters by virtue of their voice. Miranda Cosgrove, Elsie Kate Fisher and Dana Gaier return as the little girls Margo, Agnes and Edith, and they are simply adorable. The film’s 3D is nothing to boast of, so I’d recommend that if you were to watch the film, do so in 2D. Besides, the antics of the minions are best enjoyed without the burden of cumbersome glasses on your face. Despicable Me 2 will be best enjoyed by those who loved the first film, and those who love animation films in general. For most others, it will still make for a breezy, fun watch. With the minions’ spinoff film that’s been planned for 2014 - the promise of a film where the yellow fellows get a bulk of the screen time – this film serves a reminder of why that’s something worth looking forward to.

But, it doesn't quite happen. So, you end up admiring the attempt at creating the era of the 40s. I also found myself marveling at the fact that the project didn't get YRiF-ied. But, the thriller by itself is hardly edge-of-seat material.So, maybe, not all thrillers need to keep you tense through the run-time. But, you need something to look forward to, especially when you have guessed whodunnit in the character's first appearance on screen. I was hoping to clap with glee to find out I was wrong and at the same time could hear myself say, “No chance!” Unfortunately, the latter part of me won. Fortunately, while I waited then for the inevitable reveal, there was quite a bit I could distract myself with. Maybe it is just our need for something different, but the old-world indeed has its own charm. The rusty, rugged “reality”. Sure, a lot of attention to detail. But every once in a while, you are jolted out of the era, whether it be a bold sexual attempt by a lady or music that is a tad too modern. The performances though keep you steadfast, willing you to see the film through to the end. Neeraj Kabi holds your interest from the beginning. And so does Swastika Mukherjee, even if it is forceful titillatio, she's there to do a job and she does it well. Sushant Singh Rajput, of course, fits the bill perfectly. As he gets excited by the mystery, disappointed when he doesn't “get it”, grossed out at different points in the film, you know his character, Byomkesh Bakshy just a bit more. This is as important as the mystery itself – knowing the investigator, your protagonist. Especially, if the writers are aspiring to turn this into a series, which they clearly are. Byomkesh Bakshy, the character does create enough interest for you to want to watch his next adventure, even if the first one by itself wasn't enticing. Dibaker Banerjee scored alright then, didn't he? You want to watch the next one, even though the first one leaves you underwhelmed.

If at all, it could be for kids above 12 to sensitize them to conditions that some unfortunate children live in. I won't get any more specific because the film tries to be sort-of secretive about its intentions well past half-way. Rest assured that kids are going to have tons of uncomfortable questions. But, also rest assured those questions are not going to be about the dreaded three-letter word. Add to that the wanna-be cute songs and the so-humorless hour in between. Certainly not a kid-pleaser. The annoying thing is its not even made with the intention to entertain or enlighten adults. Adults know about the peddlers in our society. We've heard enough stories of supposedly well-meaning outfits being involved. There's no more insight or discovery undiscovered here. And it's all done in a very lackluster manner too.And yet the story is complicated enough to hold interest if one is really keen to. It's not a complete write-off. But there's no detailed characterization here. For example, you don't even get a glimpse of the motivations of the villains. They are there and they are evil. Enough said.None of the actors do a half-decent job of acting either. It's full of perfunctory and ""oh, I'm before the camera"" performances. Almost two and a half hours of amateur acting does get pretty tedious. There is a one-odd line that's funny and evokes a smile, but too few and thus very far in between to please anyone.I was actually hoping for something that I could take my kids for on a hot summer afternoon, a day of vacation well-spent. But, no. It's neither sweet enough for the kids, nor mean enough for the adults.

They are all insecure. They are self-destructive when in love. They are directionless. And unfortunately, this last sentence can be said about the film too. While the characters are superbly set-up individually, when woven together they just don't gel. And the standards set by the start leave you feeling high and dry by the time it reaches the finish line.","As the first few scenes unfold I try to imagine the understandable reaction of an audience that is fed on mainstream Hindi cinema. ""Titillating!"", ""Voyeuristic!!"", ""Despicable!!!"" Maybe audiences that are exposed to cinema from the world will have a similar reaction too. This is not what we do in 'our' movies. So what if almost every movie boasts a pole-dance in the name of 'item number' with the most suggestive lyrics?! Even so, I'd have agreed with them if the characters in Dev D didn't move beyond their basic needs, if they didn't try to understand each other. Or if they didn't have reasonable motivation. Or if they, like normal human beings, didn't move on from one pain to another. It's all there. Not completely satisfying, but it's there. Not entirely smoothly but you are introduced to the characters. Even though most of us might not identify with them, we begin to enjoy them. The offense to the Indian psyche starts its onslaught with the guy who is adamant and outright disrespectful towards his elders. A girl in love can go to any extent to please her man. Another frustrated, violated, unloved teenager rebels when friends and family desert her. Each one a very strong character. And all three condemn themselves to self-destruction - even if one of them takes a socially acceptable path. But, then something goes wrong. The writing in terms of the story just loses its charm mid-way. The strong characters turn limp as if the writers lost interest. Fortunately the dialogue stays crisp and smart. But, all the foreplay doesn't lead to anything exciting. No home-run after third base? Tut-tut....It's not our culture to express our sexuality. We have the urge. 1,00,00,00,000 don't happen just like that! But, Shushhh! We purge the need to talk about it. And here you have the three main characters lusting like there's no tomorrow - on the big screen at that!  Scandalous!! But, HOLD ON...It's explicit by implication not by expression. Not so much as a kiss in it for us to make a fuss about. And yet it comes across as imprudent. Sure the language is refreshingly candid. It's not exactly everyday language only because not all people can think on their feet like that. And this is what sets Dev D apart. It's almost as if the camera is just waiting for a nudge, to be pushed to capture what might be happening under that bush. But the makers enjoy teasing the audience better. Of course, this also helps in escaping the censor scissor. It's an Anurag Kashyap movie. By definition it has to try and show the society a mirror. He comments on the double standards of men and spells it out through dialogue, just in case you were trying to overlook it. The film talks about sex not only as an obsession, but also as a form of possession - this person is mine because he/she makes love with me. It drills the angst down in the songs. Almost constantly, there are words in the background song telling you something insightful if you care to pay attention. Incidentally, it was the first time I saw audience singing a song out loud in a theater. How can I leave Abhay Deol's charm or dialogue delivery skills out? O-kay, his smile and dimples too! Yet his character,  Dev's attitude made me want to slap him. Maybe because he portrays Dev's audacity that well, or maybe because Mahie Gill played Paro as if there wasn't any effort involved. I didn't need to understand much of Punjabi to know what was on this girl's mind! Am I the only one who felt like I was watching Tabu? However, the chemistry between Abhay and Mahie is completely missing when Kalki Koechlin and Abhay get together. Kalki didn't seem 100% comfortable and thus looked a little pretentious. Dev D represents what some of the urban youth go through today. Their candor, their confidence, their conceit, their sexual desires, their redefinition of true love. It’s a story told and retold over decades, in literature and on screen. But it's more open, more bold. Unfortunately, it also feels like it's half-told.

213,311,311,311,311,Devil,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review,/movie/devil-review/,,,,4.433333333,"Devil is one of those horror movies you would love to catch accidently on TV. After watching it, it would be a perfect catalyst for an evening conversation that goes something like, “I watched an interesting movie this afternoon”. Shyamalan had made better movies, but he’s also made worse – while he’s only given the story of Devil, it’s a production of his original series called Night Chronicles. Directed by John Eric Dowdle, Devil is one of those films that is perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon when you just want to be mindlessly spooked.","One distinguishing factor about Shyamalan – the Brand is that his movies can be easily placed into two extreme categories: Stimulating Good and Hair-wrenching bad. If The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs fall into the former category, you know what The Village and Lady In The Water can make you feel. It’s as if he delivers in alternates – and that also holds true about his latest film Devil. Devil is a story that worked itself out in the inner recesses of Shyamalan’s head and was given form by screenwriter Brian Nelson (of 30 Days of Night fame) and Director John Eric Dowdle (of Quarantine fame). First part of the Shyamalan produced Night Chronicles, Devil is based on a premise called the Devil’s Meeting – where the Devil takes human form, traps the sinned in an unknown location, and kills them only after torturing them. Devil deals with the same foundation where 5 people are stuck in an elevator and each gets murdered one after another during occasional blackouts. Shyamalan has admitted that the film is loosely based on Agatha Christie’s novel ‘And Then There Were None’, and that his main inspiration behind the film is Hitchcock. With this background – the writer, director, premise and influences – Devil sounded like a chilling, mind-bender. Allow me to place a two-sided argument of the movie before we can decide which category this movie falls under. You can’t go terribly wrong with a regular whodunit that has Hitchcock and Christie footprints all over it. Devil has a classic eye-popping twist in the end and a couple of bumps throughout the film, which will make the anticipated chill stop midway through your spine - but it’s not something you haven’t experience before. Fernando Velázquez provides the typical horror movie background music- banging high octave piano keys like someone is taking slow cautionary steps. The cinematography moves between tight shots of the people trapped in the elevator to establish claustrophobia, which is inter-cut with crane shots of the sky-scrapper in which these people are stuck. The symbolism is meaty, and still a bit overdone – it becomes cloudy and grey the minute these people get stuck, bang in the middle of the 40 odd floors of the building in the 6th elevator. There is definitely a melodramatic, old school charm to Devil; it’s the perfect amalgamation of a Christie novel, a Hitchcock thriller and contemporary horror visuals. The problem with such an arrangement is the lack of originality – there is nothing new that Devil offers as a 2010 film. If you have read and seen enough of the horror/thriller genre you will be able to make correct guesses about the film, but you’ll still want to sit it out, because such formulas never go wrong. The DVD of Devil has a few extended trailers, deleted scenes that don’t contribute much to the film – if anything the film is crisp because it is only 79 mins long. The DVD also includes a featurette on the making of the film – which is a little arrogant during Shyamalan’s interview but also intriguing when it discusses the myths surrounding the premise of the film. Devil won’t excite you like a guilty pleasure would, but its 79 minutes decently spent, if you’re in the mood for an average movie with a fine fusion of influences. Watch Devil because you won’t be disappointed with the overall experience of the film. Almost like your indulgence in junk food would be – it’s good in an inviting way but not stimulating.

Anyways, 20 minutes of hard laughter guaranteed in those two+ hours.","Consistency - that is what Dhamaal lacks. A few hold-my-stomach-and-laugh situations are sewn together with the regular loud, slapping-around slapstick. And in all of this, the story writers have been kind enough to worry about my well-being, literally begging my gray cells to take a break.Some of the gags were sadly derived from jokes that I first heard when I was ten, and have been deleting as e-mail forwards for the last ten years. On the other hand though, caricatures of some of the side-side-characters were outright hilarious and acted out really well too. You have to give them credit for creating an atmosphere of general interest throughout the movie. Within the first fifteen minutes you know that no matter what the lead characters plan, they are going to fall flat on their face (not literally, thank goodness!) But, it is the manner in which they fall that is pretty creative at most times. Unfortunately, the second half sees you playing catch-up with the five characters and what they are up to. The structure of the story itself becomes such that no amount of editing could create a flow in the narration.The performances were a mix of the good, the bad and the ugly too. Riteish Deshmukh and Javed Jaffrey added nuances to their characters with their comic timing. Sanjay Dutt and Ashish Chowdhary looked plain and disinterested. One doesn't expect any less from Asrani in a slapstick - the screaming is written off as soon as you know his name in the starcast. Here is the shocker - Arshad Warsi takes his cue from Asrani - how heart-breaking is that! Did anyone notice - no female lead! Ain't that great!? We all know how they could have easily been misused in a movie of this genre. No women also usually make the songs pretty much boring. The plain-as-ever lyrics and the lackluster music don't help. Not to mention the ridiculous choreography and the resultant indifference with which the cast executed it. What a waste of Javed Jaffrey! The background music did make certain situations funnier. But then, it got a bit much and annoying when it was used for every single movement of any character or object.There certainly are a few very good laughs packed in the two hours - about twenty minutes worth. But is that good enough to forgive the tolerable, miscellaneous comedy? On a lazy Sunday afternoon, on DVD with a remote control in hand - yes.

How does it make sense to unite people from the sub-continent and have them alienate themselves from the world that they are living in? Don't take movies so seriously, you say? Then movies should stop taking on serious issues!","The movie claims that all whites love to hate all browns. So, all browns hate all whites right back! First, the claim is not true. Don't tell me whites and browns don't befriend each other at all. Second, given that racism does exist, does it need any more fodder?Way too many characters have been inserted just for the sake of representing a stereotype, including the Bangladeshi who takes a beating or is ignored all the time. Merely perfunctory. The motivation behind each character's metamorphosis is just a supposedly powerful, however clichéd, dialogue. Barring 2-3 funny lines, the rest are either lame, preachy, boring or all of the above. The story is a run-of-the-mill underdog story. No surprises there, the promos said it all. Also, as it says in so many words, it serves an ""us vs. them"" agenda, rather than a story of the underdogs. I am open to being aware of injustice done to people elsewhere, but I couldn't sympathize with the characters here. The screenplay consciously follows a pattern. Comic scene followed by emotional scene followed by a lighter one and repeat. The pattern doesn’t have rhythm. They do not flow into each other, they chop into each other. Was there any editing at all? I mean other than that necessary to join one scene to the other? I can recall at least 3 scenes that only served the purpose of giving John Abraham more screen time. And a few such scenes for Boman Irani, and almost all of Bipasha Basu's scenes. John seems to have added to his range of expressions. I enjoyed his attitude in the first few scenes that had him. But later, it wore off. Boman was made to yell and overact on occasion. Anyways his character was not strong enough to make me care. Bipasha - well she had no character at all. Oops...that was not how I meant it to come out, but you know what I mean. A non-male is needed in a story for it to sell, so we spend on her make-up and clothes. Who has extra money or time to spend on her characterization, etc? Let's just make her giggle and smile it out.A sports movie has tremendous scope for the cameraman. Especially a game with fast movements, like football. But the opportunity is not utilized to the fullest. We get nothing spectacular. Not to mention that the football action scenes are unsuccessful at deception - it is all too plain that there were stunt doubles. And the non-football field scenes are shabbily shot. The music and lyrics are below average too. In fact, realizing that Javed Akhtar wrote, ""Hey dude, don't mess with me"" for a team that doesn't believe in itself is sad. However, Choreography of ""billo"" is nice. But, these are only means to an end. The movie wouldn't have worked, even if the various departments of movie making were handled well. Sports movies in India are generally made around invoking some kind of patriotism. I am not saying they should stop doing that. But, why would I care about some county league in England for goodness sake!? My patriotism is not nudged by the woes of ""browns"" settled abroad for their personal progress. Don't get me wrong, I most certainly have nothing against people migrating. In fact, there is no learning better than exposure to a different way of living. But, the immigrants choose to live there for a purpose and the positives do outweigh the negatives. A huge percentage of South Asians staying abroad will identify with the movie. And I don't have such a romantic view of the world that I would deny the existence of racism. But, the world portrayed here is the imagery that lives in closed minds. By the minds that enjoy nurturing the ""oooh-look-at-me-I-am-marginalised"" feeling. How many people from this population who are doing well in their lives complain about racism? How many of the people who are not doing well would do well if they were in their countries? Ironically, you see an ad featuring Shah Rukh Khan on a UK street - which means people who recognize him are a big enough and important mass.Is the aim to reduce the racism or to fan it further? Sports many-a-time borders on war in real life. Do we need movies to do that too?

Off late we've seen a couple of films that go on to rebuke blind faith and they've done a decent job too. In fact, both PK and OMG have been referenced to in Dharam Sankat Mein. I was bracing up for yet another film along the same lines. While Dharam Sankat Mein is different in the way in which the religious dilemma presents itself, it turns out long-winded, rather instructional and most importantly underwhelming. I am all for subtlety and am not looking for melodrama, but with a premise as this, Dharam Sankat Mein ought to have had a crescendo which is lacking. Our protagonist, Dharam (pun intended and works at multiple levels) is not so much of an atheist as he is a person who doesn't identify with blind faith. He doesn't care too much for the religion he belongs to. Yet, the writer subtly slides in the nature of our society by having him make nasty remarks about another religion. True to his nature, Dharam does become neutral as the situation demands. And I loved how his precarious  situation plays out, where agnostic Dharam ends up having to understand more than one religions.  Beyond this basic smartness in the writing though, the film falls limp very soon. The stage is set early on and you are waiting for something to happen, which doesn't. The two opposing directions that Dharam gets pulled into are not convincing enough for a man who is pretty comfortable with who he is. Somehow you can't visualise a person like Dharam submitting to anything meekly. The item numbers and shabby climax don't help either. Also, the film becomes preachy all too often. This indirectly breaks the fourth wall and jolts  you from a common middle class man's uncommon story into the film you are watching. This is despite yet another perfect common man portrayal by Paresh Rawal. Yet another film that he carries broadly on his shoulder. Even so, I appreciate the fact that despite the preachy nature of the film, a different approach was endeavoured. More power to such trials even if not many of us are taken in by them.

It's intriguing and it leaves you dissatisfied. It has brilliant performances along with some bits of Aamir Khan being Aamir Khan. It is a mellow affair that's soothing yet unnerving.","Love is elusive. Whatever the heart is after is seldom within reach. In fact, more often than we'd like, even what we 'really' want escapes us. This is the broad stroke Kiran Rao paints with Dhobi Ghat. She does so very quietly, hand-in-hand with her mild, four subdued characters. It actually feels like she's reading their diaries out to us. She passes judgment on the society we form - the young and the old, the rich and the poor, the ""educated"" and the illiterate, the secularists and the socialists. But she is almost mute as she goes about it. And none of this gets boring BUT the spark is conspicuous by its absence. Like leftover champagne from yesterday - not yet flat but not as relish-worthy as when the cork first popped. The setting could have been New York, Sydney, or even Pune. Any reasonable-size town is likely to have a slum dweller with larger-than-life aspirations, an NRI poking around the slums, an artist with an attitude, and an unsuspecting immigrant who is trying to figure the city out. Kiran Rao chose Mumbai and I'm not complaining. Mumbai does have her way of providing warmth with ruggedness, and that is the exact texture Dhobi Ghat gives the maya-nagri. Besides, I love the city and I romanticize my visits there just like Yasmin (Kriti Malhotra) does with her home videos. Her awe is as evident as her discomfort. Her resolve to find amusement in her boring life is ironic considering the hustle around her. It ain't new but the contrast hasn't come through in a movie earlier. Isn't it amazing that in a city where even stray dogs seem to be in a rush, housewives (other than Yasmin too) entertain themselves with TV in the middle of the day? You observe Yasmin along with Arun (Aamir Khan). Her simple story is absorbing. And it's very intriguing that Yasmin aroused more emotion and attachment than the more complex Arun. Maybe that's how it was meant to be, because Arun is supposed to evoke indifference. But such characters who don't make me feel anything for them leave me dissatisfied with the movie experience. Arun might just be the weakest character of the four. After all he's the only one who gets relatively melodramatic in this subtle environment, albeit only towards the end. And yet not everyone is me. Arun does manage to capture Shai's (Monika Dogra)imagination. A large part of Shai represents the stereotype of the returned-non-resident Indian who is on a poverty tour. But her emotions for Arun make you feel for her and reach out to her. And in turn you also want good things to happen to Munna (Prateik). You know his desires are beyond his reach, but you smile at his immaturity and want him to learn from his mistakes. I loved the person he grows to become. Like them or not, each character has been written in detail and has an arc of their own. And that is what keeps the viewer going in this otherwise dull ambience. There are some brilliant, mostly-earthy performances; except for Aamir Khan who pretty much stays the star he is. There's also the slight touch of humor. But, it slides into documentary mode every once in a while. There are certainly no conclusions, no strong messages, nothing that can be called 'entertaining'. The intention is to leave the audience high and dry.Yet the seasoned festival delegate will find Dhobi Ghat like every other 'decent' film he sees. And the masala-seeker might just curse the money he spent on the Aamir Khan brand. It is for the in-betweens that the film will work for best. And this takes nothing away from debutant director Kiran Rao. I like her casting. The charming faces are the aces in her sleeve. I like the milieu she has created, especially the home video parts. I like her taste in background music and her decisions on when to use it and not. And yet I can't point a finger at why this was a fine but not a wholesome experience. Maybe because I'm made to see how lonely each one of us is, no matter what our background is...

It manages to retain interest despite a preachy lecture time and again. Muzzamil Ibrahim and Tulip Joshi give good performances.,"Dealing with an oft-repeated theme of the Hindu-Muslim situation in India without ruffling many feathers is a challenge in itself. Dhokha not only takes this challenge up, but also dresses it in a different background, and accessorizes it with a convincing back-story. And yet, it sticks to its mission of getting a message across.The script flows reasonably well. The 'ups and downs' that build towards the climax manage to retain the curiosity that is aroused in the first five minutes. Actually, that should be 'downs and downs' - yeah the theme at hand is dark and so is the story. The climax does feel a little rushed but again, given the sensitivity of the topic it is difficult to imagine any other way to end the movie. Unfortunately, a few plot points seem contrived. Also the movie gets border-line preachy every once in a while. And sermons equal boredom. Nevertheless there are a few thought-provoking philosophical one-liners that make the dialogues a little above average.It was exciting to watch the two main characters unfold and they were deftly kept consistent - which is a rarity in itself now-a-days. Muzzamil Ibrahim grasped the nuances of the character pretty well. His good looks and the perfect physique is going to set many a heart thumping. I am sure not many are going to mind the multiple number of showers he takes. Tulip Joshi does not have too many lines but performs wonderfully in the one scene of substance that she is given. That said, the side characters are absolutely underdeveloped and seemed really functional. In fact, Nandini played by Aushima Sawhney does not even have a fathomable function. What was Nandini doing in the story except showing off Aushima Sawhney's shoulders!? While walking out of the theater, I was wondering what is it that makes a gloomy subject a pleasant watch. It’s not as if the performances were breathtakingly mesmerizing, or the screenplay was so taut that you didn't notice the sadness of it all. I think along with other positives mentioned above, it is the mature camerawork and lighting that added to the experience. It was also refreshing to hear some good lyrics set to decent tunes. Unfortunately, this is one of those movies that will go unnoticed by more than many. I hope it is not because people have lost their belief in cinema as a form of entertainment because of a catastrophe called Aag that hit our industry this week.

A few good dialogues placed randomly across the script and delivered very badly. Story stars over-insensitive men (and you thought that was not possible!) objectifying women.,"A host of good-for-nothings trying to make quick money to pay off the yelling landlady breathing down their necks. Heard that one before? They strike the brilliant idea of objectifying the fairer sex and start with turning into peeping Toms. But, just any woman won’t do. Not only does this particular lady have to have the perfect vital statistics, but she should also be a rich heir. Please note, there is no possibility of her being rich on her own merit. Mind you, though one woman will do for all of them put together. And of course the exaggeration plays equally on the male stereotype too. Poor things are shown to be even more insensitive than the average man, imagine that! Oh never mind, let’s move on before I get all feminist on you.Oh come on, you cannot be blaming me for giving the story away; you have seen this bit before – many times. And anyway, giving credit where it is due, there is a little more to the movie than just the foursome wooing this lady. So what, if that little more might as well have made a different movie altogether. Now, why does the name Priyadarshan come to mind?Also creditworthy is how some of the funny dialogues are slickly put in between regular lines. So, only the very attentive will get the jokes. But that’s about where the smartness ends. It pretty much doesn’t matter which character says those lines because the characters don’t have any individualistic characteristics. And it pretty much doesn’t matter where in the story those dialogues are scripted, because they could equally randomly be interspersed anywhere in the rest of the story (ies).I think it is time I stop complaining about how wasted Om Puri, Sherman Joshi, and Rajpal Yadav in their loud characters or how wooden Kunal Khemu, Tusshar Kapoor, and Tanushree Dutta are in their loud characters or how loud Asrani and Tiku Talsania are in their loud characters. In future I will try and point out things about these actors only if they are any different.Music? Lyrics? Don’t remember any of it. So, let’s just say they were very forgettable.So, except for the few funny lines and the teeny-weeny bit of curiosity aroused by the second story, there isn’t much going for this movie. But, then again, we weren’t expecting anything different from this crew, were we?

A theatre screening Dhoom 2 is not where you want to be if you are looking for a slick plot, well-defined characters or quality acting. But, if you are an action-movie-buff and enjoy watching good-looking people, it is certainly worth a trip to the cinema halls. So, if you must, watch it on the big screen. The cinematography is spectacular, makes you really  want to visit all the locations. There are some awesome creative action sequences. But they are sketchy, not detailed. Explanations for who got where and how, in at least three of these sequences, are deemed unnecessary. Some sub-plots are outright silly and some outright unnecessary. The foot-tapping numbers are a treat for the eye, especially ""Dil laga na"". However, the dances for ""Dhoom again"" and the credits feel more like a high-level aerobics class than choreography. Remember the genre of movie you are watching, the songs don't need to have any link to the story. A good action movie ""has"" to be a thriller first (vice-versa is not necessary). Romance, comedy, melodrama come later. A few smartly done action scenes stringed by some well choreographed songs are not good enough. Especially if, in the time between, you are going to have an overdose of Ekta Kapoor's soap opera style drama - two-second slow motion shots repeated thrice from different angles - not acceptable. Each of the five main characters have dramatic entries and a couple of them get the honour twice - annoying. Glaring product placements and a few scenes that looked like they belonged to the trailer of the movie - test your patience. Looks like more effort went into the layers of make-up on Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai than on Abhishek Bachchan and Uday Chopra's dialogue delivery. Hrithik and Aishwarya have done the best that could be done with their intense scenes. The rest of the movie Hrithik falls from high places and Aishwarya catwalks. The tanned Brazilian look suits Hrithik. Aishwarya's fresh look doesn't make her look fresh, she actually looks tired. Story-wise, Abhishek and Uday start right from where they stopped in Dhoom. Abhishek doesn't need to pull his buttons off to look stylish. While the over-acting settles down after their first fifteen minutes of screen time, they don't look in their element. We have seen much better from both of them. Uday serves well as comic relief and so does Bipasha Basu as eye-candy. What exactly is their function in the plot is beyond me. Did the casting director just say, ""We can't have John in this movie, so let's at least have Bipasha.""? Watch out for Bipasha's excellent voice modulation, though.  To me, this is action for the sake of action. Even though it is done well, the lack of attention to detail is just too obvious.

Nothing more than that. ","""How did you do it?"" A question every magician takes pride in not answering. Of course, Dhoom 3's magician, Saahir (Aamir Khan) is asked that too, but as an audience it peaked my interest only half-heartedly. Mainly because It is a tad predictable despite being indigestible. Two things in a movie that I have very little patience for - predictability and implausibility.But, then again, Dhoom 3 has Abhishek Bachchan and Uday Chopra trying to pull off Rajni-style stunts. How much more meta can unbelievability get? To their credit they do their best in bringing out laughter, whether well-meant or not is a matter of 'to each his own'. I did feel like observing a two minute silence in mourning as I saw Uday Chopra get a better role as comic relief than Abhishek Bachchan as sidekick. Oh well. But then again, with Aamir Khan around every one is a sidekick. So, Aamir Khan does his bit with an intense look persistently on his face for the first half of the film. It is annoying, but then again I walked in expecting that. But pleasantly, he shifts gears in the second half and actually pulls off his role very cleverly. That leaves Ms. Kaif to start with some ""Indian Goddess song and dance"" thing. It does so happen that her role is a little more than just that. Just about enough for the feminist in me to not say, ""she was used as a prop."" Even so, the performance itself doesn't require any great emotion. Anyway, what place does emotion have in an action flick, other than superficial.And superficially infused it is, the romance, the dedication a son has for his father, the revenge - all of them seem to just be fillers in what the movie is really meant for - action. The action sequences themselves are some shoddy, some pretty neat, all of it inspired from something we have seen elsewhere. Yet, for those of us who haven't seen too many action films, some bits can be a new experience. Similarly, the story will not be a new experience for anyone who has seen The Prestige. And for those people the comparison will be equivalent to blasphemy - what Ghajini was to [Memento}(http://wogma.com/article/my-favorite-movies/ ""Memento Review""), Dhoom 3 is to The Prestige.I just don't understand how the audience is expected to look over the fact that Dhoom 3 is nothing but a 3 hour long chase sequence with not just enough thrills. To add fuel to fire, what the makers thought as important is repeated and in slo-mo for effect. Sigh.And yet, I wouldn't be surprised at all if Dhoom 3 finds its share of takers and more. sigh again

So if you compare Dhoondte Reh Jaoge to the regular ""three men get together to earn some easy money"" plot, you'll feel like a rag collector in the backyard of a 5-star hotel. Because it doesn't once loose focus. Other masala comedies start with mayhem, keep it going with chaos and end with utter pandemonium. The commotion created by this one though works towards the ultimate goal. But commotion there is, I guess it maybe called inevitable for this genre.This goal is a hilarious one. A producer (Paresh Rawal) gangs up with a smart Chartered Accountant (Kunal Khemu) to make a flop film. Why? When? What? You have to see the movie to find out. But what starts off with a decent sense of humor turns into one random poor joke stringed after another random poor joke. The smartness of the basic idea doesn't run through the film. And by the way, bring me a Chartered Accountant who wears anything other than blue, gray and white...and ok black.  The individually funny elements are ultimately forced together, the flow ignored. The major concern of movies like this one must be - ""How do we end this madness?"" If you give it a mellow end, it'd feel like an anti-climax. If you give it a realistic end, it contradicts the tone of the rest of the film. If you end it on a happy note, it is predictable and cliché. So let's just make it obvious that we weren't interested in the climax and be done with it quick and easy. And fairly quick and easy it must have been for Paresh Rawal (Raj Chopra) to play the conniving conman. A couple of his scenes had me in splits. Sonu Sood (Aryan Kapoor) wears a sullen look almost through the movie. However, I enjoyed watching him go all starry-eyed when his girl is around. Kunal Khemu (Anand Pawar) seems to have done everything alright but yet he's not convincing as a geek or a guy who's in love or a schemer or a guy with confidence issues. Maybe it was the way his character was written. Soha Ali Khan (Neha) actually looks too smart to play such a dumb character. There seems to be no connection whatsoever between Anand and Neha. Both the actors and the way the romantic sub-plot is put together can share the blame for that one. It would be sheer stupidity if there are characters in a movie who are producers and film actors and it didn't have mention of other Hindi movies, right? And stupid they aren't. So there is an attempt to collect all the references they wanted on one page. Thread them together in a reasonably funny sequence with witty one-liners evenly spaced out. And go berserk. Then slowly deteriorate into a predictable pun-mode. There are a few additional bits they spoof well though. Like the comment on the role of women in Hindi movies. But that again was a good excuse for not giving the women characters any attention. Another comment is on the audience's capacity to lap up one irrational movie after another. And how there's no formula to make a successful film. Also it alludes to the fact that the makers have no judgment of the viewers' expectations. Actually, Dhoondte Reh Jaoge is in a win-win situation. If it goes down well with the audience - Yay! Hurray!! Chak De!!! If it doesn't the makers can say - ""Duh! It was intentional!!""

223,321,321,321,321,Diana,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/diana-review/,,,,2.433333333,"Princess Diana’s life was always a film waiting to happen, but director Oliver Hirschbiegel’s handling of it does leave a lot to be desired. Even though Naomi Watts makes the film watchable, one can’t help but wish the film did more justice to the enigma that was Diana.","I won’t ever forget how the 11-year-old me reacted to the news of Lady Diana’s death. My first, instant reaction – which I said out aloud – was, “Good riddance.” My rather insensitive reaction to that quite tragic piece of news was because - and I remember this clear as daylight – I thought that for someone whose only claim to fame was that she married the Prince of Wales, she seemed to be present for one photo op too many. And this was in the days when we didn’t even have access to the kind of 24 x 7 news channels like we do today.It took me a few more years to realize that this was hardly her fault; because sometimes fame chases even those who don’t want it. I must confess that I have been intrigued by her charismatic personality and her extraordinarily eventful life ever since. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel’s film on Princess Diana covers the last two years of her life, when she fell in the kind of love that isn’t meant to be, up until the day of her tragic death in Paris, which sent waves of shock all around the world. Hirschbiegel’s terrific 2004 film Downfall was similarly based on the last days of the life of a highly controversial public figure. The maturity, however, with which he treated that film seemed to be lacking in Diana.When you’re making a film on the life of a personality like Princess Diana, you’re always walking a thin line. Everyone has shades of grey, but with celebrity status, those shades assume mammoth proportions, and you never quite know where you’re headed while recounting their life. Perhaps the intent of the makers of Diana was to capture the various shades of the enigma that was she, but unfortunately, what comes across is a far too sanitized version of the last years of her life.The problem with the film, really, lies in the fact that you can never tell where her tale is being told from. Is it from the vantage point of an objective third person? Is it from the perspective of the Lady herself? Or is it from the point of view of someone in the middle – someone who knew her well enough to know certain intimate parts of her life, and yet not too close enough for her to completely trust?As you struggle trying to figure this out, you’re left with images and scenes of an idealistic woman who saw everything in black or white. She was either the victim or the savior, never just a person. The Diana of the film often comes across as an idealistic little girl trapped in a shell of fame; a shell that she’d have loved to break away from.  Whether she actually was that, one can never know, but surely painting her world in broad strokes does little justice to the life she lived, and the travails she doubtlessly endured.If Diana still is a film that can be watched at least once, it is because of Naomi Watts. Now Watts looks nothing like Diana as far as facial features are concerned. However, ever so often, when, in the film, her face is in a slight silhouette, or it passes by the camera in a flash, or even when it is gently out of focus, I couldn’t help but see Diana in her. Combine that with a regal gait, and Watts convinces you that she certainly wasn’t miscast. The slightly-out-of-shape Naveen Andrews was a brave choice for the character of Dr. Hasnat Khan. The fact that it isn’t a ruggedly masculine, chiseled man playing the character lends an air of authenticity.Still, for various reasons, Diana is far too shallow a film to truly go down as a memorable look at Lady Diana’s life. The good news, however, is that it still leaves the window open for someone else to attempt another cinematic crack at the fascinating life of one of the most enduring women ever.

Sure, Did You Hear About the Morgans? has it’s funny moments, most of which are credited to  Hugh Grant . But even he can’t overcast the fact that the film has a shoddy, predictable storyline. It just stands as a lazy film that even the makers didn’t care to watch more than once. ","They say the right cast can make a film, in least, a charming affair. So when you hear of a film starring Hugh Grant (childhood poster boy for me) and Sarah Jessica Parker (soul sister from the Sex and the City series) you think the film would be a perfect late night breeze watch. Well, let’s just say, you should use the money you would spend on the DVD to re-rent Sex and the City or Notting Hill, and stick to those.Did You Hear About the Morgans? is about a separated couple Paul Morgan (Hugh Grant) and Meryl Morgan (Sarah Jessica Parker) and their struggle with their relationship. For the first half hour, you see  Grant, who’s a big-shot lawyer, trying to win back  Parker with his goofy, boyish charms.  Parker however, can only play Carrie Bradshaw (lead character from Sex and the City) in every performance. As a successful real estate agent, she plays her usual confused, blingy New Yorker.All hell breaks loose, when as a part of witness protection, they are sent to a faraway town in Wyoming for a week, to lay low. The film then progresses to show a city-town conflict, and how the couple strives to get along and make their marriage work.Granted, Hugh Grant’s witty, puppy-faced humour works in part but on the whole, the film stands as a lazy attempt to make a romantic comedy. Did You Hear About the Morgans? is neither funny nor romantic. It’s not even a film I would want to unwind with at the end of a long day when I don’t want to indulge in intelligent, symbolic cinema. Beyond a point, there’s only so much of Carrie Bradshaw you can pair with extremely British Hugh Grant. He’s largely very wooden and conscious, while she just reminds us how disastrous people can look while they age. The jokes are second hand, the plot is repetitive and predictable and everyone in film seems to want so desperately to make it a funny affair, it just starts to get annoying.A small note about the hunter couple, Clay and Emma Wheeler (Sam Elliot and Mary Streenburgen) – to say they’re the saving grace of the film is an understatement. They serve as a pleasant contrast to the bratty, city-bred characters that Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parkerplay. One of my (read: the rare few) favorite moments in the film, is when the Wheelers ask Meryl Morgan what meat she likes and she says she’s a vegetarian who supports PETA. Mary's reply is one of the best!The DVD of Did You Hear About the Morgans? Has 3 featurettes, including one with director Marc Lawrence on why he chose the lead pair. Also the director of previously successful films like Miss Congeniality and Music and Lyrics, his insights on casting seem convincing, and you wonder where it all went wrong with this film. Other features include, deleted scenes (funnier than the film, because Hugh Grant is funny otherwise!), extended theatrical trailers and an audio commentary with Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker.The only way you should watch this film? 1. If you got this DVD for free, (I would ask you to reconsider) 2. If you’re bored, 3. If you’re really, really bored. Besides, I think its imperative you ask yourself this question, Do You Really Want to Hear about the Morgans?

Under which they assign a certain voluminous budget to no-script scripts? What is it that makes these one-liners with lofty, sappy aims into full-fledged, feature-length, films of no less than 2.5 hours!?","The poster says it loud and clear, Rani Mukherjee is going to dress as a man to play cricket. 

Cricket is after all a gentleman's game. Watching this film made me think a lot about the phrase ""had its heart in the right place."" And then I wonder if crores of Rupees and the writing muscle that Yash Raj is capable of mustering cannot have the art in the right place, what good is the heart doing? And by the way, such hypocricy! Rani Mukherjee definitely has a bigger role than Shahid Kapoor, but Shahid gets first billing. The audience has outgrown Punjab, its lush green, mustard fields, the ""chak de phatte""s, and the ""Ik Omkar""s. It's sad that the maker's heart is still trying to juice the last drop out of them. Don't they want a change of scenery? It's been what? At least over 10 years already. Oh, and if that weren't enough, there's a bhangra beat in the background music - CONSTANTLY! Except in the songs, where it doesn't stay in the background. Oh, and don't even get me started on the jingoistic flavor added to most characters - who are half-dimensional in the first place. ""England"" - bad, ""Indian"" - super good. No texture, no flavor to that line of thought at all. Actually, you can't blame them for not experimenting though. It takes a fair amount of creativity to conjure a couple with Shahid Kapoor and Rani Mukerjee in it. While there was dismay guided towards this aspect of the film in dining room conversations, I was very curious to see how it worked out. And the verdict here is Shahid Kapoor looks awesome, has a cakewalk of a role for himself here where he has to alternate between romance and serious, almost play Shah Rukh of Chak De! India. Rani Mukherjee looks good too with that brilliant smile of hers, does well with her role without shrieking too much considering she's a Punjaban and all that. Oh and for those of you who were disgusted with the thought of her in a bikini, worry not, there isn't much to that negative-marketing gimmick. Together - they create zilch. You don't feel for them as a couple, you don't care if they are going to get together or not. A huge portion of the lack of ""chemistry"" is of course, the story and screenplays fault. There's no flow, no scenes with impact, no nothing. It like, ""a woman who aspires to be on the Indian cricket team. Hmmm…nice interesting. Let's make it into a film."" How she gets there is of no consequence. You need comedy, you need romance like you need salt and pepper. Add, mix and have the audience eat it. No matter if they are gag on it. This one from the house of Yash Raj Fairy Tales is just unacceptable. In the name of women empowerment, women are still mere props. Sure, having Rakhi Sawant and Sherlyn Chopra in the script as objects of lust, might've been a comment on the irony of women's status in Indian society, but it's in bad taste. And thus the film is not better than others which use the same premise. Oh boys, no need to rush to the theaters for this display of skin, the amount of cry-shy and drama-shama, I can guarantee won't be worth it.

A few real problems looked at superficially.  Some #FirstWorldProblem you smile a cynical smile at. Unfortunately, a little shallow, a little too flaky and preachy too.","The Mehras are taking friends and family out on a 10-day cruise to Turkey and Greece to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. As a side note, they are also almost bankrupt. And they don't really like the people they are taking along – the society they belong to. This is served to you in the first few minutes of the film. Almost as if to get the shock of how rich and how flaky they are out of the way. To set the mood. To make you believe this is not your world, but is the real world of some people out there. This helps you to enjoy their world and feel for them, even if from the outside. However, you can constantly see through the superficial coverage of how fake that real world is.As a positive, Dil Dhadakne Do is very aware that it isn't digging too deep. Making a judgment call that the glimpse is enough to give the audience an idea of what life is like if you are in the top 1% of the population – financially. It's wears its cynical take on its sleeve by making you laugh a hearty laugh in some really dark situations – a bit of a surprise from a film posing as a “feel good” one. The laughter is as much an outcome from the situation as it is from the timing of the pauses. Ranveer Singh, Anil Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Chhaya, Rahul Bose all crack you up while they make you sad for their situation and/or personalities. Anushka Sharma looks like she started off from where she left in her previous film, Bombay Velvet. While each one did as great a job as the next one, I felt like slapping Rahul Bose and I felt for a confident, successful Ayesha (Priyanka Chopra) cowering to the men of her life (fine, with a few crores less). Jobs well done for sure. While the rest of the character artists – and there are loads of them – do come across as real people too, there is a blanket judgement on the entire group. All aunties are focussed on getting their daughters married? Almost all uncles are politicians masquerading around as businessmen? All seniors are outward looking and shallow. All youngsters are inward looking enough to poke fun at their branded footwear but will wear them nevertheless. This is where the film looks like it got a little too selective about the face of this world it wants to show. Priyanka Chopra and Shefaly Chhaya belong to this world in real-life, right? So does director, Zoya Akhtar. I can't imagine one of them taking the flak from men in the real world. Then, how come there is not one woman in Dil Dhadakne Do who defies that without the support of a man – be it a brother or a beau. The superficiality creates deeper fissures as it deals with “social issues”. It is too in the face. For example, while it starts out showing a character's fake liberalism subtly by a casual remark he makes. An entire scene is created, quite literally, to explain how the liberalism is fake - no room for benefit of doubt to the audience's intelligence. At other times, a brilliant and necessary point is made and then underlined, italicized and emboldened by none other than a dog's voiceover. While I have a problem of “telling not showing” with voiceovers in general, this one just takes it too far. Except for one line, that maybe couldn't have been made without the animal-human analogy, I couldn't see the reason for the dog as a character in the film at all. His inclusion felt like it was done when the writers realized the film lacked punch. Then, it doesn't matter if it is dialogue written by Javed Akhtar. A sermon is a sermon. Oh well, maybe that's what we should expect given the voice in the voiceover. Not to mention it made the film longer. Every minute over the 120 mark counts, and this one runs over by all of 50! Then come the personality transitions. I've always had a problem with one situation/dialogue changing a personality around in films. But Dil Dhadakne Do made me wonder. Are flaky people really the more aware ones? Deep down do they know very well that they have chosen their masks? All they are waiting for is something/someone to call their bluff and they will straighten out. Writers Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti make this happen quiet convincingly. Until they go overboard (pun intended). The climax is rubbish and it is out of place and it is so not what we saw in their previous outing with Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara - a film with one of the best climaxes. Same can be said about the music and crisp dialogue. So, my 11-year old daughter has been desperately waiting for me to come back from the film because she wants to know if she can watch it. While watching the film, I wondered if she should be exposed to conniving parenting, lest she believe like the film wants you to, that all parents manipulate their kids. On the other hand, she might come out believing that how lucky she got with her parents. Yeah, maybe I will let her watch the film. See what I did there? evil grin

227,325,325,325,325,Dil Juunglee,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma reviewPreview16 Critic Reviews 1.3/5.0,/movie/dil-juunglee-review/,1.3/5.0,,,2.7,"A sincerely superficial film. Makes no attempt at making character motivations believable. A case of “believe it or leave it”. “Leave it”, it is then. ","Each of us has our own definition of love and don’t feel loved till that definition is satisfied - if I had to read value into the hotch-potch of a film I just saw, that would be it. Koroli (Tapsee Pannu) believes love is when one goes beyond thinking of themselves, it is love. Sumit (Saqib Saleem) love Koroli but has no qualms about loving himself too. If only, Dil Juunglee had even a little more substance than one definition winning over another, it would have been an average film, at least. It is a good start in the sense that both the definitions sound reasonable. However, not only is the culmination run-of-the-mill, but it also goes way too wrong with the details. To begin with, Dil Juunglee stays confused between wanting to keep things light (read slapsticky) and taking love seriously. Striking a balance between comedy and romance is hardly unachievable, but it doesn’t quite go right here. At one end you are shown in great detail Sumit’s career struggle and at another end, you have the most superficial business meetings imaginable headed by Koroli. I am not sure if a fat finger can be pointed towards sexism. In fact, I don’t think that is the issue. For, if the makers had given the writing that much thought, there would have been a reason to complain. Interestingly, I found some of the situations quite the opposite of casual sexism – where casual sexism is thrown around as in real life, but the character it is directed towards refuses to succumb to it. 
The lead pair infuses all their acting prowess into the film, but a weak script, weaker character sketches and the worst arcs allow only for so much. You are pretty much asked to believe what is going on rather than seeing the character through their thought processes. Also, save for Jay (Santosh Barmola) who is given a composed and controlled character, the side characters are all quite loud and unbearable. So, save for the lead pair’s performance, there isn’t much going for Dil Juunglee. And that we have seen a lot better from both of them. Yep, that’s too little.

Ignoring the other aspects of relationships, sexuality in mid-life crises is explored via some good performances. Wish other aspects were acknowledged too.","Each life has a story – boring as it may be but there’s a story. Dil Kabaddi chooses 2 couples going through the 2/4-year itch (7 y\ears is way too long) to display the one issue that causes it – boredom. The basic disinterest in what the other finds interesting leads to this boredom. And underneath the boredom, you might chance upon layers of confusion about what one wants from life. All these complexities in a relationship are explored only through the lens of sexuality.Sexuality is addressed so directly that there’s no room for innuendos. It’s so direct that it is refreshing considering how the topic is taboo in Indian society. And yet it does not shock. You begin discussing your relationship in your head, just as the couple on screen discusses its own when their friends have a fight.The situations seem very close to urban relationships in real life – simple but complicated because of the need for complications, so satisfied that each one needs its own mix of masala to keep it alive. Or maybe the simplicity and satisfaction are just an illusion behind which the characters have found cozy corners. The movie does get out of a generic Hindi movie’s comfort zone by given each of its women characters an identity of their own and men displaying their insecurity.Over the period of the two hours, we are fully aware of each character’s sexual needs but don’t get much of a peek into their emotional ones. Their need for companionship, compatible companionship is a given. Something that supposed doesn’t require any explaining. And this is where I was left thirsty. I wanted to know them better, the gray characters that they were. But, I was denied that.And this despite wonderful portrayal of confusion, frustration, and indecisiveness by all – Irrfan Khan, Soha Ali Khan, Rahul Bose and Konkona Sen Sharma. Together they help maintain the light vein in which the seriousness is handled. Case in example would be Soha Ali Khan thinking of paint colors for her room while in bed with her husband as if she was in an ad with her real-life brother.The light-heartedness is equally attributed to the background music. Just like the music composer seems to be in love with his ensemble and what he can do with it, I fell in love with the music. As if it were flirting with the mood of the characters without once getting overbearing.My biggest complaint is the sense of discontent that I leave the theater with. Of course, I’m not asking for back-story, thank goodness they didn’t give any of the characters any. I’m asking to know a little more about the characters – their aspirations not just sexual fantasies, their need for company not just lust. And there was enough room for this since each scene seemed to be stretched to exaggerate the situaion, the camera lingering around a little longer than need be for me to grasp the situation. Even if it is something as interesting as cheating on a spouse.Extra-marital relationships seem like the flavor of the season. Dil Kabaddi has focused on one aspect of any romantically-inclined relationship,  picked 3-4 types of characters of each gender, and mixed them up in different permutations to make perfect soap-opera. Yep, I managed to squeeze all the juice out of various interesting angles that the above medley can have. Now, what if I tell you, the ‘one’ aspect of relationships chosen is ‘sex’? The juice is back, right? Not entirely but enough to make you sit through. Because, it’s interesting to see people make the most of their mundane lives.

Save a couple of interesting characters performed well, there's nothing at all watchable in this 150-minute ordeal.","The heart - it is allowed to behave like a child; especially when it's in lhhove and all. But what is unacceptable is to allow a kid - however grown-up he might be - to write a full-length feature film. The situations are amateur and the play on words is childish. If you are not convinced of the low standards of story and dialogue writing in the first two hours, watch out (if you are going to watch that is) for the down-market climax.Within the first few minutes of the film, the three lead characters and their problems are presented to you. This is done as plainly and as non-creatively as possible - which is true of the rest of the narrative too. It is literally Ajay Devgn's love story - cut - Omi Vaidya's love story - cut - Emraan Hashmi's love story - cut - repeat. Within the first few rounds, you can predict where the next cut in the story is going to take you. To the next of the three characters and whatever he is upto next. Only that, whatever is happening in his life next is pretty much similar to what happened last. Ajay Devgn is the clueless, middle-aged boss falling helplessly in love with a girl almost half his age. And he keeps falling in love. There's nothing out of this world that this actor is required to do. Emraan Hashmi (they call him Abby) is the playboy -- surprise! -- who is always thinking of the next girl to take to bed. Even when he likes one more than the others, it seems like he has only one aim in mind. A been-there-done-that for him too. Omi Vaidya (Milind Kelkar) is a simpleton and proud of it. Once he falls in love he lets the woman take him for a ride. Again and again. Omi's performance was almost a repeat of his 3 Idiots character. Also his timing is completely off. He actually had a couple of good lines which are completely given away by the way he said themNow apart from these repetitions, there was this constant nag. I am rooting for no one. Not even the good-natured, squeaky-clean-at-heart, aawww-so-sweet-that-he's-boring Milind. And I think a lot of it had to do with timing. Maybe just maybe, the lame lines I was complaining about might have been tolerable if they were delivered as quickly as a comedy requires them to be. An extra pause here, a moment of thought there puts an ailing dialogue to sleep. In the midst of some dreadful writing, it is disproportionately refreshing to see some sort-of variety in character for a couple of the women in the film. Not that the details are deeply thought through, but since they are performed reasonably well, they provided some relief in the otherwise plain narrative. Tisca Chopra as the woman going through mid-life crisis and Shraddha Das as the woman who can misuse people around her were the only source of relief - the characters as much as the actors themselves. On the other hand, Shruti Hassan has the flattest dialogue delivery ever and it got too damn annoying even if it was a smaller role compared to the others. And it is difficult to judge if Shazahn Padamsee can act if all she has to do is chirp, ""please please please please please."" Sure, her character requires her to do that, so we will save judgment until she gets some real dialogue. And what's with Madhur Bhandarkar paying a tribute to all his films? Just when you are wondering if a glimpse from Page 3 and Corporate are coincidental, you witness a ramp walk and a jail is thrown in too. Sure, his attempt is not as in the face as other self-referencing directors manage. And though it does sort-of weave in and out of the film, it is still distracting. Oh yeah, and there is the trademark referencing to homosexuality too. But this time around its really shoddy and stereotypical.Madhur Bhandarkar's trial at exposing the big-bad world of love turned out to be a 75-minute wait for the interval followed by another 75-minute wait for it to end. You don't care how, you don't care why, all you care about is when.

Ok fine, a couple of genuine laughs too. ","A little while into the film and I was wondering why the interval hasn't struck yet. That's usually not a good sign. Occasionally it can mean that so much has happened in the film. Naah, don't get your hopes up, it was the former.  Can't remember the last time I saw a film which started off with such a resounding vibe of “what else did you expect?” Toilet humor, racing cars, over-enthusiastic sound effects, and so on. Some time in the middle of the first half there is a slight upward trend with a couple of good laughs and an unexpected plot point. But, we quickly go back to what we were expecting and that's that.In more than one way, the story comes a full circle from where things started in 1995 with Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, it does a double take too. Certainly, Dilwale has a lot more story than you'd expect in a Rohit Shetty film. 
Doesn't mean the details are any less predictable. Oh, I am exaggerating, the unpredictability lies in the fact that when you expect a song a fight sequence is thrown in. Also, having a story doesn't mean it isn't ridiculous either. It is and it makes you roll your eyes over and over. And when the story doesn't do that it is taken over by most of the dialogue. That or you snort or snore. The only relief then comes from a few lines that make you laugh. A few of those are just at the plain silliness of it all, a few because of the way Johnny Lever delivers them and a couple from Varun Dhawan's dialogue delivery. He actually tones the drama down quite a bit. Whether it is the director's call or his contribution is difficult to say. But those times of restraint come as a welcome relief from the background music's omnipresence and more. It is as if the score would feel guilty if the money spent on it didn't show. Kriti Sanon isn't anything out of the ordinary, could be because her character isn't either.Shah Rukh Khan-Kajol are completely devoid of chemistry in their scens together. Just like old times - he hams, she shrieks. I don't know if I'm sad that we know that he can “not ham” and she can “not shriek”. Irrespective of what happens later in the film, that might justify their behavior, that bit was quite unbearable to sit through. They make up for it a bit later with a lovely scene. Awkward sitautions in Hindi films usually go wrong just by exaggeration. Owing to the actors restrain in this particular scene, it turns into one which I will remember every time I think of the film. Which unfortunately, will not be too often. As I wrote the preview for Dilwale, I wondered why should I watch a film that I am so apprehensive about. And now I remember. Films like these were one of the reasons for me to start wogma. Films that are superhits, but I just didn't like. Films that ask me to keep my brain aside. Films that are loud and are proud of it. It was to raise my squeaky, little voice and register a protest. While watching it today, I remembered the other reason. In these films there would usually be something that I enjoyed. These moments would get masked by the negativity the film would invite by just being what it was. However, I didn't want to forget those moments and how a movie made me feel. With Dilwale the one tiny twist showed me a ray of hope that at least some attention is being paid to writing. A couple of genuine laughs took the bite away from the toilet humor the film began with. The one scene with awkward silence stuck. Other than these, the movie was everything I expected from it – yawn and cringe inducing. But hey, that's how little it takes to go from “Switch channels if it's on cable” to “Watch if you have nothing better to do”.

For its wit even if might seem a little over-written. For its nerve even if the after-taste is that of an under-cooked story. For Vidya Balan because she is entertainment! ,"sattaakkk A slap on the audience's face - The Dirty Picture. The lewd men that watch a film just so they can experience Silk's (Vidya Balan) performance are the one's sitting in the audience right now - you and me. Of course, not me as in literally me, because I'm neither a man nor a lesbian. And sure, not all men enjoy a bold woman. But there are enough of us in the audience for whom Silk Smitha starred in 400+ films! And that's just one sex symbol from the 80s. There were others like Nylon Nandini and Polyster Padmini whose lives collectively forms The Dirty Picture's Silk. Even their names make us smirk, and a second later, we snicker at what their personalities stand for. Yet a sizable number from amongst us watch their films. The Dirty Picture is about a woman who not only flaunts what she has, but knows its value and encashes it unapologetically. She has accepted herself. How many women do you know who are absolutely comfortable with who they are? And I haven't even asked about them being comfortable with their sexuality.  In fact, so relaxed is Silk with herself that she makes us uncomfortable. The Dirty Picture is an uncomfortable watch. How can someone be so positive about doing something that is so dark-gray in society, that it's almost black? And she is making the same society, us, dance. Add to this discomfort, the torture of having to watch flab and the female lead's stomach tiers, in the 21st century. Hell, we are even uncomfortable with our bodies. But, Silk is uninhibited and so is the director, Milan Luthria. It's a huge risk to make your female lead look ugly and fat. And to say, ""You want gratuitous skin-show? Here, take it. And here's some more."" You are literally force-fed cleavage to the point that the guy (yes, guy!) sitting behind me said ""It's getting boring now"" when there is a half-naked woman on the screen. Yeah, the second half slips. The first half is breezy and completely entertaining. The second half gets too caught up in showing the pathos that comes with stardom. It does leave you with a ""She came. She got you excited. She left."" But the lull in the second half might be intentional. Because the said pathos however mundane and predictable, needed to be shown. Maybe the line just before the interval is a warning. It's a clever line. And so is almost every line in the film. The dialogue in ""The Dirty Picture"" feels like a twitter timeline composed of extremely witty people. Over-written, maybe, but I thoroughly enjoyed the humor, I laughed out loud, and there were instances when the theater laughed after a pause that it took for the line to register. The wit alone is entertainment enough. I'm not a huge fan of self-referential jokes in our films because they get repetitive. But, The Dirty Picture has one in which it felt like the director has left an extra second or two, like a stand-up comedian, for the audience to ""get"" it. And it works. It's a huge compliment to both Milan Luthria's confidence and the actor's performance, because it meant that he made us forget who he is. Similarly, all your awe for the actor that Naseeruddin Shah is vanishes and you want to slap him for his arrogance and sleaze. Tusshar Kapoor plays a forgettable character, and I mean that as a compliment. Because, his character is meant to be unimportant and he plays it well. Vidya Balan...almost the whole review is a rave about her. She made me feel for a character who I otherwise would have dismissed as characterless.You could see why men would fall for Silk, and not just for her physical boldness. Like films that glamorize underworld dons, she has glamorized our ""sex icons"" from yesteryears and you don't feel squirmy. Instead, you empathize and even convince yourself that they have been victims. Even though every decision they make towards that dark-gray zone of society is a conscious one. Sure, the writing must have its merits for the actors to achieve what they did. But, throughout the film, you feel that you are getting snippets of someone's life, like newspaper cuttings. The flow is missing and you just see glimpses of the layers that make Silk an intriguing person. It also felt like this was done knowingly, to add to the enigma that she is. But, it left me wanting to peel off the mask and see the person behind. A feeling of being told an incomplete story. On the other hand, I'm glad they didn't serve me a sappy backstory. Usually, something lacking in the story would make me recommend a film a little less. But there are other bits in the writing that make up for it in The Dirty Picture. Especially, the climax, not in the way it's played out, but the reason behind why things end the way they do. It's subtle and it flows by swiftly. But it's beautiful and is one of the few things that work in the second half. Again, those shortcomings still do not take away from the bravado it takes to show a plump woman for 150 minutes; the pluck it takes to make cleavage undesirable (okay, maybe I'm taking it too far, but it makes cleavage look like breasts - a regular part of anatomy); the nerve it takes to tell the story of a woman who people look down upon. Surely, the Silk Smithas of the world are smiling in their graves.

An action film that cannot be bothered to even attempt innovative moves.,"You cannot even call the events in Dishoom convenient coincidences. Because there is no attempt in showing cause and effect. The story of a top Indian cricketer being kidnapped before an important match by itself isn't very engaging. That's not to say that it couldn't have been. If only the writers had that much focus. I won't say that the writers were all over the place because you know there is a lot of things they could've done that they didn't do – like item numbers during the film or slapstick and so on. But within it's genre, it has little head or tail. A couple of sequences in fact, seem like they were shot just because they were conceived. For example, a chase sequence on bikes in a theme park has completely no head or tail within the context of the film. Similarly, Ishkiya's (Jacqueline Fernandez) existence has no head or tail within the context of the film. Especially, in the second half, it looks like she is there to provide some variety in terms of gender. Another reason could be to stand at one place and smile goofily at the characters who pass her by. Even so the lady makes the most of it, trying to provide whatever variety in expressions as is possible within the limitations of her character. She seemed a lot more comfortable than she has been in her earlier films. John Abraham is as expressionless as is possible. And Varun Dhawan is as comic as a sidekick comic relief usually is. Neither of these mean a thing, right? Varun Dhawan barely makes you smile and for all the grimness John Abraham might muster, you still can't take the film seriously. No wonder then, that when a bomb is counting down 3..2..1...you can't muster an iota of anxiety. Akshaye Khanna does bring in a tad bit of fear for a few seconds on his entry into the film, but that doesn't stay too long. That is why it is difficult to give Dishoom any benefit of doubt. For even in a comedy, you can take it seriously and laugh only if it has real comedy in it, right?

It is also a film on the cold, brutal nature of profiteering private corporations.","Hollywood has loved to make alien invasion movies. 2009 has been different. From the top of my hat I can recall at least a bunch of movies that have turned the tables on this concept. There is of course Avatar, then a funny animated flick called Planet 51 and then there’s District 9.Interestingly all three belong to different genres and seem targeted at altogether different audiences. Planet 51 is meant for kids, for instance. Yet these three films have a common theme -- that who is alien and what is acceptable are very subjective and that alternative perspectives can change one’s standpoints drastically. Avatar is about humans creating havoc in an alien landscape. Planet 51 is about an astronaut landing on an unknown planet and realising that he is the alien there and not vice versa. District 9 however is slightly different from these two. Here an alien spaceship descends upon earth and mysteriously malfunctions over the city of Johannesburg. It continues to stay there without any communications till the humans break into the ship and discover a city of malnutritioned alien beings. On humanitarian grounds, the earthlings give them refuge till they realise that they might’ve made the biggest mistake of their lives. Directed by debutante Neill Blomkamp, District 9 adopts a documentary style of filmmaking in its first half. In the second half however the camera doesn’t move as violently even as the action does get pretty gruesome. The film itself owes its roots to Blomkamp’s sci-fi short film in which a similar alien spaceship lands over Johannesburg. Needless to say because of the film’s South African setting you can find a lot of references to the apartheid years. The theme of forced eviction is one such instance. The name of the movie itself refers to District 6 from where some 60,000 people were evicted in the 60s. District 9 is a stark tale of the xenophobic nature of human perspectives and the never-ending greed of private corporations that will go to any extent to make profits. The film also seems to give out a message that is loud and clear, a message that quite a few films of last year seem to be giving out -- that just because we are humans does not mean we are always in the right. Wikus’ struggles are as heart-wrenching as they are eye-openers. The tight screenplay and the path-breaking direction only add to the pathos of his story. Of course, towards the end District 9 resorts to some clichés. Either way it makes for some great viewing and a must-have on DVD.

234,332,332,332,332,Django Unchained,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review2 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/django-unchained-review/,,5/5.0,,3.8,"Quentin Tarantino returns with Django Unchained and pretty much delivers what was promised. In Django, violence always looks cool and tongue is always firmly in-cheek, as some fine actors play out a politically incorrect, talk-heavy but no less bloody ‘Spaghetti Southern’, if you will. Though not for everyone, Django Unchained is a film that will doubtlessly entertain many. ","Here’s the thing; just like how the release of a new Quentin Tarantino movie is an event, the DVD of a Quentin Tarantino film is a collectible, no matter what. That’s why it surprises me when DVDs of his films are always designed and packed just like any other.No matter, because Django Unchained is a great film to have in your DVD collection. The pack contains just the one DVD, which has both the film as well as the special features on it. The main special feature is titled ‘Remembering J. Michael Riva: The Production Design of Django Unchained’, a 12 minute piece that looks back fondly at the film’s production designer, who died while the film was being shot. Though a nice piece in itself, it disappoints slightly because it’s strange to talk about a film’s production design and not have the director and cinematographer make even a cursory appearance to talk about it.The other two items in the list of special features are promos for a Quentin Tarantino Blu-Ray pack of 8 films and for the OST of Django Unchained, respectively. Nothing much to shout about, but the promo of the QT Blu-Ray pack excites you with the promise of having over 5 hours of never-before-seen footage. Other features on the DVD include the options of having Hindi, Tamil & Telugu subtitles.Like every Tarantino film, Django Unchained gets better with each viewing as well. So, really, cinephiles just absolutely must have a copy of this one either way.At the outset, I must confess that I am the biggest Tarantino-phile that you’ll meet. I’ve watched every one of his films more times than I can count and I have marveled, laughed, ogled and dropped my jaw at his films more times than most people have even said his name. In short, I’d like to believe that I am to Quentin Tarantino what Joss Whedon is to comic books. Or there and thereabouts.Needless to say, Django Unchained has been the film I’ve waited for the most, for about two years now. When I finally watched the film on the big screen, it delivered exactly what it promised – cheeky, irreverent, violent, indulgent fun that you might either love or abhor, but you just can’t ignore. Set in the American Deep South a few years before the Civil War, Dr. King Schultz is a German dentist-turned-bounty-hunter, who is on the lookout for a slave named Django who, he believes, can point him into three of his targets. What begins as a business relationship between a former slave and bounty hunter then turns into a joint hunt for Django’s wife, who he was separated from when they were sold.While Django Unchained certainly isn’t Tarantino’s best film to date – it isn’t nearly as outlandishly entertaining as Inglourious Basterds or as narratively clever as Pulp Fiction - there is still a whole lot of fun to be had with it. Politically incorrect as always (the dangerous ‘N’ word is used even more than the ‘F’ word), with unapologetically gory violence in abundance (but my, how beautifully the gun battles have been choreographed!) and zany characters that will charm you irrespective of which side of the moral spectrum they stand, Tarantino writes and directs what is essentially a Western (or a Southern, as he likes to call it) with flourish. Unmistakably though, Django Unchained does struggle sometimes as a film; one of the big reasons for this, I suspect, is the fact his long-time collaborator and editor, Sally Menke, passed away in 2010. Menke edited every one of his films from Reservoir Dogs to Inglourious Basterds, perhaps making her the person who understood Tarantino the director, and more importantly, Tarantino the writer more than anyone. Django has been edited by her erstwhile assistant Fred Raskin, but he doesn’t nearly seem to show the kind of understanding of Tarantino’s style that Menke did. Something that I sorely missed was that one great, long, slowly unpeeling conversation piece that gently builds nerve-wracking tension until it reaches a nail-biting crescendo, before exploding into what is usually violent climax. This, I’m sure, has as much to do with the editing as the writing. Strangely enough, stripping away its genre exterior, the satirical take on slavery and usual Tarantino-isms, the film is also partly something that he has never really made so far, a love story. That perhaps, is also one of the reasons why Django Unchained may disappoint some; perhaps love stories aren’t his thing to begin with. Also, at 2 hours and 45 minutes, there will surely be those who’ll find the runtime a tad too long. Then of course, there are his usual liberties, those taken with as much conscious effort as the bits of genius. So even a nighttime scene in the midst of a dense forest is lit fairly high key, the source of light becoming a question mark if you pause to ponder over it. Another frequent Tarantino collaborator, cinematographer Robert Richardson (who, incidentally, also frequently collaborates with Martin Scorsese) lights Django Unchained creating some truly gorgeous frames out of the most mundane visuals. He also uses exaggerated zooms often; something fastidiously avoided by most filmmakers, because it often looks amateurish. In Tarantino’s & Richardson’s hands, however, they only do what they were intended to do – draw instant attention to characters, expressions and situations. Django Unchained, then, becomes fun primarily because of the characters and the cast that essays them. Jamie Foxx as Django is superb. Watch his character gradually change from being a confused slave to a confident free man, as he gets used to the idea of no longer being bonded. Tarantino seems to have made a habit out of writing Christoph Waltz into Academy Award-winning roles, and with good reason. He is expectedly excellent as the articulate and immaculate German former-dentist, Dr. Schultz. Samuel Jackson and Leonardo DiCaprio have largely been ignored at the awards season this year, and I fail to understand why. Separated only by skin colour but one no less devious than the other, their characters bring a new spin to ‘negative’, and the two perform immensely well. They were, for me, the pick of the cast.What separates Tarantino from most other filmmakers isn’t the fact that he is a fine screenwriter as well as a director. Each of these facets of his cinematic craft has a distinct voice, which explains why he confidently puts out the completed scripts of his films online well before they are released and why those scripts invariably make for great reads without later ruining the experience of watching the film; his films, after all, exist in an entirely different universe altogether - an elevated movie universe with its own rules. And therein lies my big concern with Django Unchained.Tarantino has so far made two kinds of movies – his ‘real’ movies like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and his exaggerated-universe ones like Kill Bill and Inglourious Basterds. One can imagine the latter two to be movies that exist in the universe of the characters from the former two. Thus, one can imagine Larry Dimmick from Reservoir Dogs going to watch a WWII flick called  Inglourious Basterds in the cinemas. Django Unchained, while tilting slightly towards the latter category, isn’t an obvious outright fit there, if you try to explore it further. Thus, even though I maintain that Django Unchained is mostly a delight, when compared with the sheer audacity of some of his earlier filmography, the ‘de’ is often silent.

Sounds boring and is too. But the relationships are warm and the issues are real. Unfortunately there is a patch in between which makes the film a drag. That along with the preaching takes away from the crisp film it could have been.","Each of us has that one teacher, we are thankful for, when we look back - the one who made that subject interesting. And for every one of those teachers there are at least 10 not-so-good ones who kill our will to study. After all, what motivation do they have to be good teachers in this country? This is the backdrop against which Habib Faisal sets stage for the decaying system we are all becoming a part of. All in a fun manner using charming characters until the preaching comes in (all pun intended). Even a hint of a middle-class milieu in films and the first people I think of are Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Basu Chatterjee. No, I don’t want to get into a comparison game, Do dooni chaar doesn't match up to any of their products and that's alright. It's just cool that it brings a smile by reminding me of my all-time favorite directors. So, with reminiscing done, we can begin appreciating what the other senior citizens are up to. Neetu Singh, what a brilliant choice for a comeback. The first time I heard of her return to films, I was weary - weary that she'll take up a role which puts her across as a wife-to-a-rich person and knows not what to do with her life. Then I saw the posters of her on a scooter. Along with a sigh of relief came another source of weariness. Is she going to behave poor while strutting around with the finest saris? A-la Hema-Malini-in-Baghban. Yeah-yeah I'm a very weary person. The flip-side though is that I'm still in awe of the simplicity with which she-played her easy-going character - calm despite repressed needs and all that goes with being an Indian home-mom. She reminded me of my mom. Not once does it feel that she was away for so long. And good movie or bad, I hope to age at least half as gracefully as these women are approaching the other side of 60. Also, it's brilliant that they didn’t even seem remotely tempted to use the Rishi-Neetu history. Of course, there's Rishi Kapoor too. A-ha! Here's something I'm not weary of. Somehow, I'm always sure he'll do well as any character he has to play. O-kay, he didn't remind me of my dad, but some of his scenes with his kids are just the right amount of emotional. Another one with a student of his brought me to tears, despite being clichéd, predictable and all that jazz. His acting and the writing - both of the situation and the dialogue - put together create such a perfect moments to get all misty-eyed. Even otherwise, the writing touches upon many varying issues. Here's the checklist - The irony of the joy of getting your own money back from a government agency; the supposedly inevitable and certainly gratuitous pot-shot at the media; the oblivion in which parents live with respect to the street-smartness of their teenagers; the irresistibility of the  ""keeping up with the Joneses"" game; and of course the whole comment on how the job of a teacher, the building block of any society is treated with little respect; meddlesomeness of parents even though the child knows the right thing to do; human nature of being dissatisfied; the  car salesmen, loan phone calls - not an exhaustive list by any means. Do dooni chaar is the coming of age of a family and the relationships within, despite individual limitations and their inadequacies as a family. It's mostly fun and emotional but falls into the pits of boredom every once in a while.

Read it as a typo. Read it as 'not' instead of the numerologically correct 'knot'. And start with the ticket-seller. Do not disturb the Box Office.,"A few people complain that I take ""without giving the movie away"" too seriously and I should at least give a bit of the story outline. Here you go - an infidel husband is trying to hide his illicit affair from his wife who's keen on finding out more about the woman who is nagging her boyfriend to leave his wife who has hired her admirer to spy on her husband who has hired a man to pretend to be his girlfriend's boyfriend who is trying to escape from the girlfriend's ex-boyfriend. And I'm not making this up! I truly don't even know which pulled hair to begin with, for slapsticks like these. They take my frustration with ""brains out"" school of film-making to astounding new levels. How come? Because they take actors like Ranvir Shorey and throw them down the chute. Ok, can't complain about Govinda and Riteish Deshmukh because they have set themselves in that groove. Though they know and so do we, they can do much better comedy if they were given a chance to. But, charming Sushmita Sen - with or without the extra weight? She can act, most certainly better than this. Same goes for Lara Dutta.  I've always liked her for carrying of all kinds of attires in style. But the skin on display here is yuckety yuck!! And all she does is shriek, shriek louder and some more. And as if that weren't enough there's a sequence in the film when Govinda and Riteish Deshmukh adopt a female voice. And by definition women shriek, right? Right! So at one point there were 3 female shrieks on at once. Oh, the nightmare! Actually, I think most of the dubbing was heavily processed by the latest equipment available for editing. I refuse to believe any human could create so much noise so consistently for such a long time. And not so much as half a punch line in this never-ending circus. Not a single gag that could bring as much as a smirk out of you. I sound so petty trying to find faults in a film that might actually have felt offended if we liked something about it. Zilch content unless loud tight slaps, louder background music, moronic situations can make a non-negative contribution to content.The religiously inclined, please let the movie-watching audience know what ritual we need to conduct to send the Dhavan-Govinda combination to retirement. Please, please, please, oh mighty ones, please tell us…

Entertaining, though only in bits.","You find yourself siding with a con-artist. Not just a person who dupes the other of money. She robs  emotions, feelings and wears the thievery on her sleeve. She takes offense when she hasn't been able to win someone over with her charm. She takes it up as a challenge that has to be won. Not a very likeable attitude for a person you would know in real life. Yet, you cheer for the screen her. In a sense, you feel her liberation and you are with her when she says, she might find more freedom in a prison than being locked in a marriage. Especially, given how possessive the recipients of her fake-affection get. Yet, not much of your involvement can be attributed to much about the film. It is very difficult to figure out what exacly makes you root for Dolly. The dialogue isn't very interesting, neither is  its delivery. There isn't much striking about the other departments of the film either. The music is the kind you'd find in every other film. Sonam Kapoor in the lead comes across very stiff, even a little more than her usual self. Sure, the side actors do their bit well from Rajkummar Rao to Archana Puran Singh, but none of the characters have enough depth to make themselves believable. Even a shallow character like Archana Puran Singh's can evoke an emotion if written better. It is this mixture that confuse your loyalties. The victims of the con-artists' con-job are not very likeable. Then, it all boils down to Sonam Kapoor's persona itself – the actor, not the character she plays. Her face, the fact that she is the lead lady, takes away from the film. Sure, there is nothing wrong with liking the anti-hero. But, somehow it kept me distracted through the film. I don't like the character so much, then why do I want her to get away with it? And yet again, I find myself liking a film more than I usually would because of what I didn't “get” about the film. The only thing I know for sure is I enjoyed the overall concept and felt a liberation of sorts with the way the film ended.

Of course, you have to ignore Shah Rukh Khan and the exhibition of the many faces he is capable of making, through all of this. Fortunately, there is enough to distract us on the tour. Name it – cinematography, art direction, locations, action, special effects – all visuals have been done very skillfully. Our brains though are taken for a roller-coaster ride by the storyteller. Yes, there are a few additional twists to the original plot. While some of them work and keep you interested, with others you are deprived of a satisfactory explanation. The direction is classy in most parts. A few scenes are superbly executed – the one where Don meets Kamini (Kareena Kapoor), the one in which she is found dead, the one in which Jasjit (Arjun Rampal) is asked to do some work for the goons. Then there are others that could have been done better – the one where Vijay escapes while they are being transferred from one jail to another, the one where Jasjit is taking his child away from the gangsters. Having expectations before seeing a movie can change the flavor of a movie, just like the food you eat changes the flavor of a wine. This movie would be much more enjoyable if you are not constantly comparing. But expectations are called for when you are paying a high profile tribute to a high profile movie. Comparisons with the 1978 Don are inevitable. We have some cool new dialogues which add spice to the movie. Some loopholes from the first movie are smoothened out and a little additional back story fills in the blanks appropriately. But new loopholes and blanks crop up with the new situations. Let’s just say, the new story has its fair share of flaws too. I thought Chandra Barot’s Don was long and it dragged in the end. I was happy when a lot of sub-plots from the original were cut down, but was saddened very soon, with the new sub-plots taking up too much screen time. This time too the pace slackens in the last hour. You can’t have an action movie in this day and age slowing down in the end - that’s just wrong. Granted, Shah Rukh has a lot to live up to, but all he needed to do was follow the master’s steps! Was there any change at all in dialogue delivery, intonation, voice modulation between Don and Vijay? In the Sauna scene, you see the Amitabh-Don oozing with confidence – the Shah Rukh-Don is just sitting there. You see constant suspicion, and rightly so, on Amitabh’s face in ‘Ye mera dil…’ – through the song Shah Rukh’s eyes are full of lust like that of a schoolboy, and suddenly he smartens up. You know Amitabh is satisfied and happy when he meets the children at their hostel, Shah Rukh is just regurgitating the lines. You sense fear in Amitabh’s body language when Zeenat Aman points a gun at him, not a muscle moves on Shah Rukh’s face in the corresponding scene. Maybe some of this can be claimed to be intentional, but all of it? That’s hard to digest. The other actors have done a great job. Boman Irani seems to fit into any role that he takes up. Arjun Rampal needs special mention, why don’t we see more of him? The three ladies Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, Ishha Koppikar do their bit suitably. Though the songs are not the greatest when you are listening to them (again because you are constantly comparing) they have been picturised beautifully. The choreography is very good especially for ‘Maurya’. Shah Rukh oozes with energy when he dances and he has done a pretty good job with the rap-like singing bit in ‘Khaike paan banaraswaala’ too. All-in-all, you have to bear in mind that when you go for a Mission Impossible or a Bond movie, you go more for the style and special effects than to see a good story or quality acting. Similarly, a trip to the cinema halls won’t be wasted when you go for this one; you are guaranteed a stylish product.

The few extra seconds taken to establish a scene with elegance give the crux of the scene away. This keeps this action-thriller from being crisp. Multiple, smart twists are pointless if you are going to chicken out in the climax. ","What are you going to do with a villain who always has a Plan B unless he's busy making you believe his Plan A failed? Hate his guts? For sure, yes. Especially since he is cocky and every line he utters is a wise-crack. As an afterthought, you also admire the writer's capacity to throw in twist-after-twist while making sure you know motivations behind characters' behaviors. But maybe he over-estimated our capacity to be interested in the turns. After a while, it gets tiring. The HUGE slip-up in the second-half and the blurring motivations make Don 2 an average Hindi film. When the choice is between a scorned woman's wrath turning into gullibility and Don having a change of heart - you know the writer has copped out.  No explanations are good enough if you are switching character traits that you took two films to set-up, within a heartbeat. In fact, I wanted to laugh out loud at the proceedings, but my brain hadn't finished being bewildered at what I had just seen on screen. Et tu, Farhan Akhtar? I suddenly had a flashback from Dil Chahta Hai's ""proposal at wedding"" scene. Gosh, what a turn-off that was! Anyway, there are a lot of things going for Don 2. Shah Rukh Khan is certainly one of them. He makes you forget, you are watching Shah Rukh Khan. Either that, or this is the best use for his typical stutter laugh. Maybe that spluttering chuckle should be reserved for villainous roles and avoided while being comic or romantic. Not just that, his voice modulation works. His look - especially in the first half an hour or so of the film goes completely with his character. And of course, his character is such that, almost all the actors have only one of two things to do, when around him - act as if they are on their toes and don't trust him, or visibly show they despise him. Everyone from Priyanka Chopra to Boman Irani to Nawab Shah do a decent job of that. There is a slight variation in the form of Om Puri who is a dispassionate CBI officer and Don is just another criminal for him and Kunal Kapoor who is fresh and self-assured. It's a shame then that, you can write a few decent characters; you have the intelligence and flair for intertwining plots to make them work as a thriller; yet you end up making a film that nosedives into mundane in the last 20-30 minutes. There is also the matter of too much time taken for stylizing everything. In his attempt to add oomph to many scenes director, Farhan Akhtar, over-estimates the time the audience will take to let the twirl in plot to register. In turn, he gives the audience time to figure out what's going on and ends up making the scene predictable. And this happens scene after scene. Fortunately, these scenes are shot well. The film is also a collage of beautiful shots from around the world. Some may even accuse it of being a travel company's brochure that wants you to visit each of those countries. But, it is also an evidence of Don's reach and the expanse of his power. The action sequences are choreographed and shot well too. But you can't help but feel there is so much more Farhan Akhtar can do. It almost seems like he is testing waters one step at a time, ""Hollywood does this, let me try. If this clicks, then next time, I'll experiment with what I really want to do."" Maybe, it's just my wishes taking over. Meanwhile, you are left with spectacular camera and stunt work, but nothing that you haven't seen in action films so far. The only thing left to look forward to then, is the smart aleck remarks Don is going to make to leave the people around him retortless. That too begins missing the mark - makes it too filmy without being memorable enough. Especially, since you have seen many of them in the promos. It's almost like dialogue writer Farhan Akhtar is trying to live up to his father's name. Alas, he overdoes it and in the process repeats his father's lines way too often. We know you love the lines your dad wrote, Mr. Akhtar Jr. We love them too. But now, you have begun to kill them for us. For now though, I'm going to grudgingly appreciate the loathsome lead character you've tried to create. If only you hadn't let the devil take human form.

Maybe for the thrill, maybe they need the money. Maybe both. But the fun and thrill are sucked out of their endeavours when they try to rob a blind man. Now, here comes the twist. You would think you want the trio to pay for their crimes and root for the poor ol' blind man. But, very soon,  you find yourself praying for the youngsters. And this is just from the trailer. As discomforting as it is, I liked this turn of emotions that the writers/director manage. Other than that though, Don't Breathe gave me the same old, “Why make horror films at all?!” feeling.As you walk out of the theater you realise that your muscles are tight not because of the suspense from the last 90 minutes. But it is from the shock value of what a human mind gone wrong is capable of. Don't Breathe could just have been another CSI episode – granted, one of the more creepier ones. Of course, a movie can manage to send a chill down your spine only if it well-made. This means, the direction is taut and the performances are on the mark. True to expectations, the characters are all appropriately scared and trying to outsmart each other, knowing quite well that they might fail. The camerawork manages to maintain the suspense. Especially, when it goes down to minimum light possible in an already dark environment. You and the other characters get as close a feel as is possible, to what the blind man must go through to find his way around. Even so, nothing makes me like films in this genre. Even if the shock tactics worked to keep the four couples around us quiet from their constant nervous giggling and chatter. I can just about make myself acknowledge that it scared me, so it must be good. However, scaring me doesn't take much, so...

241,339,339,339,339,Doomsday,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma reviewNotepad,/movie/doomsday-review/,,,,3.8,"Futuristic action adventure film, which hustles along in a most entertaining manner.","Director Neil Marshall has been heavily influenced by two important action movies of the 1980’s; an influence that becomes very obvious the moment the film starts. One of those movies was George Miller’s low budget Australian film Mad Max, starring a then unknown Mel Gibson, and the other was John Carpenter’s Escape from New York. Both movies dealt with the future, a future where mankind and civilization lie in ruins and the only law that prevails is that of the jungle.  Doomsday deals with very much the same scenario except for a few minor changes. The heroine here is a woman, Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) and in an obvious reference / tribute to Snake Plissken’s character in Escape from New York, she too has an eye patch. The rest of the plot is quite the same, with a few additional elements thrown in. So how does the director rework the scenario?Well, I must say he does a pretty good job of it. For one, he does not take himself too seriously, that is for sure. He looks like he is having fun and that is wonderfully evident in a very campy scene where the leader of the Gangs / Punks, Sol, holds an audience, literally. There are strippers doing the pole routine, then a group of hefty men in tartan skirts dance the Can Can while the crowd roars uproariously, and as a climax we have a prisoner being roasted alive in a huge barbecue, with Sol shouting much to the delight of the audience “We have a rare treat in store for you tonight! Medium... fucking... rare!” And if that is not enough, the director sources material from another realm of fantasy, that of Arthurian legend, and locates nearly one third of the film in that realm.  There is an excellent fight sequence, where an unarmed Eden Sinclair fights a huge skulking armored brute in a most violent joust. We are not given too much time to think; footage is not spent on establishing character; the story is on cue and rolling right from the start. There is a back story, but that is very quickly dispensed with a voice over and a few frames. The rest of the film plays on one of the deepest fears that we have as human beings; that of departure from a zone of comfort to an Unknown zone which holds all possible terrors. There are no reflective moments in the film at all, none of the characters indulge in any introspection, and this gives the film a sort of breathless rush. And then there are the car chases, all of which involve a Bentley Continental GT Speed driven by Eden Sinclair. The chase sequences are a direct tribute to Mad Max, and even though the stunts are all what we have seen before in a thousand other films, it all makes for great enjoyment. We are not spared the gore either; bodies are crushed under wheels, heads get lopped off, and are also cleaved in fine fashion. Somewhere there is also a message of political duplicity and of public office being used to further one’s own ends, but this is all too brief for it to really matter. Rhona Mitra makes a good action heroine, she is lithe and lean, and has the narrow eyed, square jawed look so essential to playing such a character. Her face conveys a sense of vulnerability too, and that balances out her tough and bleak portrayal. Bob Hoskins makes an appearance, and so does Malcolm McDowell. 
The film offers us nothing new, but it is all done in such good spirit, that one finds oneself enjoying the whole spectacle, and also rooting for the good guys. PS. An interesting aside is the character of Sol, played by Craig Conway. In this film he is Malcolm McDowell’s son.
Years ago Malcolm McDowell had played the character of Alex Delarge, the vicious and sadistic Droog leader in Stanley Kubrick’s controversial film, A Clockwork Orange. Craig Conway’s portrayal of Sol has shades of Alex. Like father, like son? (Sol literally means sun, hmm, the director indulging in a bad pun to make his point!)

It is dark in there, nobody will see the tears, so it can’t dent your self-esteem!Dor unveils one emotion after the other – intimacy, loneliness, grief, hope, resignation, oppression, guilt, greed, contempt, liberation and of course love. Yes, most of the story is heartbreaking but the narration is beautifully executed and has enough light moments to keep your interest alive. This tale is about two women from diverse backgrounds having common aspirations – but while one has the courage and confidence to make her own choices, the other is resigned to her fate. The spectacular locations and magnificent cinematography alone warrant a trip to the cinema hall. Ayesha Takia has uncovered a new dimension to her talent by bringing out the complexity of her character by a moving performance. Though Gul Panag’s dialogue delivery lacks depth and she has yet to master the complete range of expressions, she does look promising. Their make-up (or lack thereof) leaves you speechless. It actually defines and contributes to the characters. In their first shots you can immediately point out that Ayesha is the lively-yet-timid kind and Gul is the strong-willed one. While the focus of the first half hour is to build the storyline, the simple dialogues get dull. And enter Shreyas Talpade! He literally brings life to the screen every time he is on it. The credit goes to Nagesh Kukunoor for bringing out the best in the trio. He has, in fact, pulled off some scenes without any background music. And hey, one more movie without any lip-synching!The other artists are just about mediocre, including Nagesh. Looks like he will need a co-director to direct him. Or may be it is the character inconsistency. It is not fair when a character unwarrantedly becomes malicious without warning. Also it is disappointing when a movie of this caliber has a nasty character change tune just because she is “influenced” by one dialogue that was said to her. Someone, some day has to come up with a better climax, or at least a new way of showing, ""I have to get to the train station, or all hell will break loose"". Nagesh has taken the first step by hushing the dialogue, but it is still too dramatic and long-drawn compared to the rest of the movie.

...Boom...
Not a moment wasted...some random song with digitally enhanced voices and extra blue skies. But it also has Shilpa Shetty literally all over both Abhishek Bachchan (Sam) and John Abraham (Kunal). Just so no one can complain. All the boys in the house need a gorgeous, barely-clad woman to drool over. And girls can take their pick - John 'Perfect V' Abraham just after a swim on the beach or the casually dressed Abhishek nodding his head in style. Though most of the apprehensions mentioned above were appropriately done justice to, a lot of the mental preparation seemed to have worked. Because I was pleasantly surprised to hear myself laugh at regular intervals - Thanks to the situations created and some brilliant timing by Abhishek Bachchan. However, John is back to being a part of the furniture as far as acting goes.Sure the jokes were intended to take advantage of the way the audience laughs at gay people. But, the situations they were places in made it funny. No credit to the dialogues though. Their only function was to remind us that they are cool enough to use the word 'gay' openly - every 10th minute. Anyway, like all good things, the laughter soon dried up too, largely due to repetition. And stop using the 'brother from another mother' line already!It is amazing how a simple, sweet concept can be completely ruined by keeping the narrative absolutely flat. The superficial conflict is treated ever so lightly that you can't let the superfluous drama get you involved. Sam and Kunal both get annoyed, anxious, jealous, apologetic and turn into perfect arseholes (what else can people who use Taare Zameen Par to manipulate children be called?) at the exact same time. Was one character at conception stage split into two to give it the gay angle? And of course there's no necessity to show a single bonding moment between the males, they are after all so similar. Neha (Priyanka Chopra) does have a shade more detailed character. But even those details seem to be just there as tokens rather than serving an arc. Yet, Priyanka sincerely expresses whatever Neha is going through. This is her fourth movie this year and yet she brings freshness to the screen. There's something superbly charming and warm about her and the way she carries herself. Can't blame her if Neha's feelings don't have a logical flow to them or if one moment all she cares about is her job and soon enough it barely matters.Fluidity is in general lacking around here. I'm not talking about characters transforming by a preachy one-liner (remember the deep breathing exercises before the show?). It’s the absence of even that one-liner. I'll thank the climax for all the eye exercises it helped me with - so much eye-rolling I haven't done in a long long time.The focus is on mockery here. Mockery of how the gay behave and of how they are perceived too. Mockery of how parents react when they know their child is homosexual and of how blinding love can really be. A movie on relationships and friendships, yeah right! Not this one.

Any little trust you might have in the ""scripts"" they choose, is misplaced.","Makers of such slapsticks suffer from a huge superiority complex. By such slapstick, I mean, the """"ball hits balls"" and again and again"" kind of ""comedy"". And the makers' arrogance is transparent. Obviously they are intelligent people. They have raised  finances for such a dumb product. And yet they have this condescending attitude towards their audience. Or maybe, having money and knowing what to do with it, requires two different types of intellect. Even so, we know for a fact that Arshad Warsi, Riteish Deshmukh, Jaaved Jaaferi AND Sanjay Dutt are capable of so much more. Heck, even Ashish Chaudhury can do a better job with overacting than this. And yet, they chose this film. They couldn't be that out-of-work, could they? Miss Cleavage-Kangna-Cleavage-Ranaut-Cleavage and Mallika Sherawat did a better job than any of the guys, imagine that! Well, then again, that's only relative.The thing is the film has a plot that had huge potential to be funny. Four good-for-nothings trying to out-smart a smart aleck ex-cop. But if you are not going to get the least bit creative about your characters, how am I supposed to get interested? Save Maanav (Jaaved Jaaferi), the other three good-for-nothings have no distinguishing characters. They all can mimick, they can all role-play, they can all pull-off a disguise. Even though the disguises were well done and could actually conceal identity, the changed identities remained pretty much the same. Why have three different characters? Oh, too much money and we know not what to do with it, I forgot.If they didn't feel the need to work on a plot or characters, the least they should've tried is get a laugh or two out of us, right? Whole eggs crack in the mouth, and a guy chews on his boxer's naada (the string that holds the boxer shorts up) - they make me squeeze my eyes close and I can taste the disgust. In that sense then, I could feel what the characters felt. SighNeither do the umpteen references to other films or actors from the industry reach out to my funny bone. There is this slight comment the makers want to make about the babas (spiritual gurus) are no better or worse than goons from the underworld. But, the whole sub-episode is so loud that you couldn't bother yourself with subtext. On the other hand, the film does try to laugh at itself. There's a comment about the foursome, ""they look like crooks"" That is true. All four of them look straight out of the goon-factory - shady and repulsive. Then there are these two scenes where Sanjay Dutt makes a ""I don't have patience for this anymore"" expression, mimicking what's running through the audience's minds at those exact points. Yet you cannot forgive them for taking you for a fool.Another film that takes the audience for granted. Another one that would make the lousy sms forwards more interesting than the supposed smart-quips. Another one for you to skip and so you can enjoy the monsoons.

245,343,343,343,343,Doubt,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/doubt-review/,,,,1.7,"When you’re in doubt, you’re pulled in various directions. Your arms hurt from being tugged by every extreme that stands on it’s conclusion – John Patrick Shanley’s Doubt makes us understand the complexities  behind a doubtfulstate via the story of a catholic school and it’s doubt about an incident that changes the characters’  life. If the truth is a postmodern concept – doubt let’s you explore every syllable of it without affirming to anything. Much like the film, where you watch, try to deduce, calculate, speculate and end up sitting down exasperated, taking that comfortable breath of doubtful questions. ","As a child we’re always told to not fear when in doubt – that a solution will always appear sooner or later. It made us seem that doubt was a horrible thing, lying there under our beds with the cookie monster, conniving and scheming to turn us into complex individuals. John Patrick Shanley’s Doubt  celebrates that limbo feeling of neither-here-nor-there. It celebrates doubt, not in a conventional way but in a manner that makes you agree that every question needn’t have an answer. Starring Meryl Streep, Philip Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis (all four received academy award nominations for their performances), Doubt is set in a Catholic school in 1964, at a time when the church was undergoing a reformation. Streep plays the principal Sister Aloysius, who is an authoritarian and a traditionalist. As a contrast to her, we have Reverend Flynn (HoffmanAmy AdamsThe conflict arises when Reverend Flynn is accused of abusing the first black child in the school. There is no evidence provided to prove either side – neither to Sister Aloysius, nor to us as an audience. Rev. Flynn is just shown to be kind and empathetic towards the boy who gets bullied because of his colour. We swim around in a circle of questions, much like the other characters in the film, who oscillate between many a Yes, No and Maybes. During the film, you forcibly try to deduce an answer, scrounging around for hints that point to a tentative explanation - because we all need those explanations, for us to feel sane and normal. The beauty of Doubt lies in its rejection of confirmations. The movie provides you with no answers, and let’s you gnaw on an existential crisis through the film. The film’s tone is somber, with slow plot movements, a calm yet eerie piano foiling the background score and emphasized performances by all the characters. Hoffman and Streep play staunch opposites and thus, the pressure to pick a side elevates.

Doubthas what you would call powerhouse performances. You see the film through several points of views – Hoffman, who makes you believe he is innocent, Adams who makes you live the frustration of torn sides and Streep who is the reason behind your doubt. For all her firmness and staunch beliefs, her eyes always have the question mark. Viola Davis plays the child’s nerve-wracked mother, who furthers your sense of doubt. Doubt was adapted from Shanley’s play Doubt: The Parable – when you learn this fact you see how wonderful this subject matter would be as a play – with its scope for drama, tension and dense self-questioning. The DVD has a 19 min featurette titled ‘From Stage To Screen’ where Shanley talks about the adaptation. The DVD also has interviews with the Cast, an audio commentary of Shanley and a few extended scenes. Watch Doubt, so you can experience the joy of rejecting closure. The truth won’t always mean closure, and closure isn’t always the truthful end. In doubt, you can truly remain.

246,344,344,344,344,Dr. Prakash Baba Amte-The real Hero,Watch when on TV/online,wogma reviewNotepad2 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/see-rank-dr-prakash-baba-amte-real-hero-review/,,4/5.0,,2.366666667,Shoddy screenplay dampens the impact of an inspirational story of a great social worker - Dr. Prakash Baba Amte. The film could’ve looked far better had it been edited intelligently.,"We all love heroes. We sing to their tunes. We dance to their moves. We read about them tirelessly. And we even follow their films mindlessly. But what about an extraordinary hero, you might have never heard of or seen before? Will people throng theatres just to watch such an unusual hero on celluloid? Well, I found my answers when I saw audiences turning up in big numbers on the first day, first show of Samruddhi Porey’s Dr. Prakash Baba Amate. The auditorium was buzzing with excitement. Though it died down very shortly.The film is the official biopic of Dr. Prakash Baba Amte – a man (played masterfully by Nana Patekar) who sacrificed his entire life for tribals and wild animals in the Hemalkasa area of Maharashtra. It traces the struggle of Amte and his wife Dr. Mandakini Amte (Sonali Kulkarni) with tribals, wild animals, naxalites and corrupt government officials. The film takes you back to an era where this man lived, worked and even performed emergency surgical procedures without electricity. The way he developed personal bond with tribals and wild animals is one of the most fascinating aspects of Amte’s story. This tale is undoubtedly heroic. However, not this film. At least not the way it is narrated. I don’t understand, why director, Porey had to overemphasise the protagonist’s heroics in every single scene? Actually, this is the outcome of passé, lacklustre writing. Its screenplay is structured in the most typical manner. I know, flashbacks inside a flashback look bold. But only if they’re handled carefully. Considering the subject, occasional slow-paced narrative is somewhat justified. But where is the drama that hooks you with its storytelling?Every department of this film seems haywire - writing-direction, cinematography, editing, sound design or even makeup. Mahesh Anye’s Cinematography is beautiful, undoubtedly. But it fails to add any value to the storytelling. What’s the use of capturing stunning shots, when they rarely tell you a story? That wow factor is missing throughout the film. The visuals and audios are sometimes poles apart. When you’re dying to see the drama, you’re bombarded with philosophy. But when you actually get to see it, you barely feel anything about it. You just see gore, but feel nothing for the characters or their situations. That is another letdown. The film’s only saving grace is Nana Patekar and Sonali Kulkarni’s acting prowess. Both the lead actors are back (after Taxi No. 9211 and Deool to charm you with their power-packed, sizzling chemistry. However, directing your talented, lead cast isn’t a big deal. The real challenge is to bring good performances out of the extras (mostly tribals) as well. Nagraj Manjule's Fandry is a beautiful example to describe it. This is where Porey fails miserably.Average films turn better (of course, to some extent) thanks to smart editing. However; this film’s amateurish, outdated editing adds to its woes. The film does have few sequences you can emotionally relate to. They are simply beautiful too. But the director’s overall focus seems to be only on telling (sometimes showing) you almost everything that happened. This leaves you disheartened.“Dr. Prakash Baba Amte - The Real Hero” isn’t a terrible film in its entirety. The makers had a fascinating story to tell through two of the best actors our industry has. They definitely seem to have had a good intention (who wants to make a bad film anyway?) It’s just that their approach went wrong. The sad part is that this is the official biopic of Amte. I doubt if this inspirational tale would ever be retold.

A psychological thriller that hooks, thrills and keeps you thinking after it is done. ","My heart raced through most of the length of the film, and a long one at that. This is even though I know most of what has happened as the characters find out themselves. This even though there is drama, very average performances to distract you from the events in the film. The anxiety comes from not knowing if the protagonists will get out of the situation. The anxiety comes from not knowing how much they will suffer before getting out, if they do at all. The anxiety comes from knowing the odds are against them - not just the situation they are in, but also knowing the writer/director might not necessarily be kind to them either. The anxiety comes from being involved with the characters to such an extent. I don't remember the last time my emotions were engaged in a thriller. Sure, the situation itself a little out there and the way it is handled a little too smart to be believable. But, once you have suspended that initial disbelief, given into the situation, and the drama begins to unfold you realise the intricacy of the set-up and build-up. Little questions like – why would a mother with a relatively uncommon name Nandini name her daughter a rather common, Anju – are answered and they add to the narrative. Some explanations, of course are a little convenient. But largely, you are doing something beyond rooting for the family you have begun to care for – you understand why people who love them, love them; you want to hurt the people who hurt them. Drishyam has one of the most riveting second halves I've seen in a long while. Usually, thrillers build up well and fizzle out in the second half. But here most of the action come post-interval. This also means that it takes its time to build up. The start does make you restless and wants you to tell the story to get a move on. And maybe had the film gotten to its crux 10 or so minutes earlier, it would not make you wait for the interval. But, it is difficult to tell what impact that would have had on the audience's involvement with the Salgaokar family. Also, a lot of the drama took me away from the characters into the reel world. The cheeky-cheesy reference to cinema being an educator is well, cute but a little far-fetched. A self-aware statement that films manipulate thrill using edits and music is instantly followed by use of “comic”music to bring in a laugh – that too when it wasn't necessary at all. The scene was funny by itself and the music actually took away from the smile. Again, a tighter rein on these bits could've also enhanced the story-telling.Even so, there are things that worked for Drishyam that are otherwise trappings of a thriller. For instance, usually when a character unveils the mystery by speaking it out loud, it is a put off because it feels like you are reading a report. Here, the character is revealing the events as she is figuring it out herself. There are other instances where a shot from earlier in the film is repeated when a character is retrieving it from their memory. Usually, this is annoying because it is more to serve as a reminder to the audience than the character. Here, however, it is an essential piece in the narrative.Other than commenting on the role of cinema in our lives, the misuse of power, the parenting style of the afffluent, Drishyam poses a question about right and wrong. You do wonder what you would have done if you were in IG Meera's (Tabu) place and how you would have worked your way around the situation that Vijay Salgaokar's (Ajay Devgn) finds himself in.When a film largely works, it is difficult to find fault with the performances. But, except for a shot or two, Ajay Devgn looks like he is sleep walking. Shriya Saran too comes across as functional. Tabu has an enormous screen presence, yet it can hardly be called a challenge for her. In fact, the two little actresses are the ones who come across as the best actors in the lot. So, Drishyam becomes one of those rare films that has a narrative so strong that mediocre performances don't hamper it. That is not to say Drishyam is taut. It is hardly flawless, but it glues you - body and mind alert - to the story. A thing you can only rarely say for a thriller. It is not a visual treat that ought to be watched in the theater, but it is a film which can be appreciated and encouraged for its writing. And of course, no home theater can enhance the thrill like a dark cinema hall.

With a brooding, charismatic protagonist, cracker one-liners and bloody violence (with sufficient build up) Drive is 2 hours very well spent. ","Nicolas Winding Refn’s Drive begins with a cursive pink-font opening-credits, and the kind of background music you would hear in a car - semi-thumping, lounge-ish beats with a 80s retro-electronica pinch (take a bow Cliff Martinez). We are then introduced to the film’s unnamed protagonist, the Driver (Ryan Gosling). With a half toothpick, a scorpion jacket and brooding eyes, he moves through the entire film with an unnerving calmness. I can’t say the same about my journey of the film though – Drive manages to break the hypnotic spell, the moment you just about get into the grovoe of its controlled, thought-provoking cinematography and trance like, anticipated soundtrack.Drive is a neo-noir, smooth and sporadic film about an edgy hero (and I use this word deliberately) and his escapades. Refn uses the archetypal split-lighting to establish the driver’s character, followed by the hovering cloud of a western film (in which the protagonist’s an unadulterated badass).By day, he works as a car stuntman and part time, in a garage.  By night, however, he drives. No really, in his words, ""If I drive for you, you give me a time and a place...I drive. "" Abandoning all morals (quite unlike his job and his overpowering image), he stands as an amused observer of the corrupt world he’s a part of. There, the Driver gives you a slight aftertaste of films like Taxi Driver. The film uses a popular, pulp fiction-esque narrative. Of course, the treatment is stylistic, a nasty bit of a tease. It’s a hide and seek of what-now and wow-really? You see similar signs – the pink font, an opening sequence which establishes the feat of our protagonist, the jarring car chases, and the bad guys who are almost like contemporary Mafia lookalikes. Yet the film doesn’t take a moment to jump from a subtle cat-and-mouse chase to a full blown blood war. There are skull-breaking, knife diving moments in the scene almost as if Refn wanted to celebrate the idea of violence by making us believe it was never going to cross our paths. Driver’s bond with his neigbour Irene (the sensual Carey Mulligan) is silent, and furthered by his relationship with her kid, while her husband, Standard (Oscar Issac) is in prison. The film takes a bloody turn, when the Driver helps Standard in a heist to clear his debts and issues. Here starts the predicament (read: almost sadistic war of the blood splatters.)However, at some point during Drive, the stylistic treatment of the fights between good and evil takes over the plot of the film. You realize soon into the second half that the story has been abandoned to take upon the intended feel of the film – one that we had only been given glimpses of through the first half, mostly through the Drivers lilted, calm voice and brooding eyes.You also question the driver’s motive for all this violence, because somewhere amidst the rhythmic visuals and the colossal build up, Refn fails to establish a concrete relationship between the Driver and Irene. You don’t understand how someone like the Driver, who otherwise seems like he doesn’t give two bricks about anything, would undergo all this mess for a woman he barely spoke 8 words with. Once you accept to move past these questions, Drive is a hard-hitting, dark and downright entertaining film. Might not work for the faint-hearted, but the good thing of Drive is that it gives you enough to think-ponder-mesmerize before the violence starts.

They forgot a title card -Starring: Blue petal, the digital ancestral spiritandDevdutt, the guiding horseWithout them Drona would lack soul and attitude. Not to mention, our superhero wouldn't have a clue, literally! Sarcasm set aside, I really liked the concept behind debutant blue petal - just the overuse annoyed me. As it is, the movie is flat because of its pace. Without them it'd bend downwards at the corners to form a frown.Which would then resemble the ""I carry the burden of the world"" scowl Jaya Bachchan wears. Perfect casting! Seriously, when did the lady smile last, on or off screen? It hurts when I remember she brought smiles by her mere presence and was my favorite female actor till about 10 years ago. Oh well...Anyway, when you have music and cinematography doing the character development there is only so much the actors can do with the one-line character descriptions. And they do the 'so much'. Priyanka Chopra dazzles in shiny outfits, and oh yeah, fights. Kay Kay Menon actually seems every bit the eccentric villain he's supposed to be. He can boast of having delivered two interesting lines in the movie. Abhishek broods and battles. He delivers the occasional dialogue, one of which was awesome! He actually looks really pitiable when he is going through tough times. But that is over quickly. Soon enough he has the ""What the heck is going on here?"" look which absolutely reflects the audience's sentiments. And this stays. Through the car chases. Through one inane sub-plot after the other, especially in the second half.Actually, I really liked the way it started. It had that nice story-telling tone. Characters seemed to have caricatured personalities for a reason - they were part of a mythological tale. The parable itself seemed to have an interesting base. The villain seemed eerily weird. The editing was slick with imaginative transitions. I was enjoying despite redundant songs and having written off the dialogues very early on. What can you expect when an egoist, full-of-himself villain says Gustakhi maaf (pardon me)?Yes, I had begun wondering if the wait for a good, kids', action, Hindi movie is over. But, gradually by the end of the first hour, my inner voice wanted to reach out to the makers, demanding an interval. Cut now, or you are going to have nothing to say later. They didn't listen.  And the second half made the pre-interval phase a blur. You know how 'stars' are introduced in a typical masala Hindi movie? - Slow motion, inexplicable melodrama, enhanced with jarring music in background, cameras making movements to make the tall actor looking even more larger-than-life. The entire second half seems like it is introducing one actor or the other! There's a bit of that in the first half but it seems so negligible by the end. The emotional drama takes forever to unfold - Drona and mama, Drona and Sonia, Drona and his father, Drona and his ancestors, Drona and his horse, Drona and his enemy. And get this Drona is not the supercool hero who can taken on the world himself, he needs them at every move. However, he somehow knows how to combat and his heroic skills suddenly peak every time he needs to save his bodyguard (Priyanka Chopra). And this ain't any regular protector, she's the 'royal' bodyguard who needs to be majestically rescued every 10th minute! And at the end of it? There is no satisfactory achievement, just some more mumbo-jumbo about having saved the world.True, there have been quite a few lame superheroes. He gets to be special because well, he's the 'chosen one'. Usually the sidekicks are a set of strong personalities with their interesting idiosyncrasies. But here, who has the time for such stuff when you are location hunting all over the globe and know you are going to spend a lot of time in post production with the digital intermediate guys. Our man just needs to be at the right place, at the right time, with the right amount of background music and camera movements for over a couple of hours.So, are the special effects and action sequences worth a trip to the theater? Well, I'd think not. If you like movies just for those things, you must certainly have seen it all already - if not in a Hindi movie elsewhere. You can think of Drona as the coming of age of a 'special' boy. He supposedly finds love, loses it - twice, finds it again, overcomes his fears, and discovers his 'inner strength'.  He achieves all of this, at most times by just walking a few steps and the rest is taken care of by the graphics department. The struggle 'external' or 'internal' doesn't quite reach a high note. And that doesn't quite work.

One you can watch again despite convenient climax. ,"Do you fall in love and get married or get married and then learn to love? What if you learn to hate instead of learn to love? What if the whole thing starts in one's resentment towards the other for no fault of the others? What's new about it anyway? Not in India, anyway. What makes Dum Laga Ke Haisha such a warm film, then? A film which has characters that wear their weaknesses on their sleeves to make the film charmingly close to real life – save for the climax, of course. Prem aka Lappu (Ayushmann Khurrana) has been no good at academics and loves Kumar Sanu. He is pretty much considered good for nothing by all around and in return is cynical about the world around. Sandhya (Bhumi Pednekar) is educated, mature and is submissive but won't take nonsense lying down either. She's a woman's woman who has no self-worth issues. She is also not the conventional definition of good-looking either. And therein lies the crux of the conflict in the film. With very little to go on, other than gut-feel an arranged marriage relies a whole lot on how the other person looks. And Prem gets pressurized into marrying someone who he doesn't like at first look. So, why does he get married at all? Well, he is considered a good for nothing, remember? And what voice does a suppressed lad have when he has achieved little in life, right?That there is a pointer at the scores of social dynamics in an arranged marriage – pressure, gut, looks, submissiveness and so on. Dum Laga Ke Haisha has captured it all so well and in just the right measure to not make it dramatic and yet keeping you completely engrossed. Sure, it falls into the historic, cop-out trap of both a quick, convenient finish and dramatizing the events. But it tries. It tries with the right ingredients that work well – conversations in a relationship. Unfortunately, there aren't enough of them to make events believable. I understand, there is always the risk of too many conversations and the danger of the run-time slipping across the two-hour zone. But, the balancing act left a little something lacking. Fortunately, it wasn't the performances. Of course, no film about ordinary domestic squabbles can manage to create warmth without ace acting by all involved. And that is exactly what Dum Laga Ke Haisha has. From the lead roles to the ones on the side you know which one is likely to behave in what sort of a way in the given situation. The bitterness, the selfishness, the momentary pleasure and the pain all come through.Yet, Dum Laga Ke Haisha is not a very serious film. Sure, it addresses a social flaw and how the people that make the same society are coping with it. At the same time it isn't too satirical or dark. It brings a smile because the characters have their quirks and keeps you interested because the characters are like you and me, only with different quirks. What else can one ask from a film that aims to do exactly that! And this once I mean that in a nice way.

The lines are limp and the situations are far from creative. The plot is strung together with a  series of events that have no flow.,"It's nice to see a film-maker, whose focus is 'style', trying to talk about the victimized middle class. He tries to say that their only hope against their helplessness is by taking responsibility and trusting no one but themselves. Sounds too deep and dark for a mainstream film? Well worry not, the film doesn't take itself that seriously because it is made up of some of the most ridiculous lines and has situations taken straight from the mafia films in the 90s. Only that present day Jeevan seems to be Aditya Pancholi. Can it get any sadder than that? Yes, it can.The hour-long, pre-interval screen time is spent only in set-up. It introduces its 5-6 main characters and lays out the situation - none of which you can care about because there is zero attempt by any character to connect with me AND there is nothing compelling about the story so far.Whatever happens after that has to work twice as harder to become interesting. An uphill task that only gets steeper. While most of the moves, twists and turns are predictable, there are actually a few events that took me by surprise - more like ""wow, they actually did that in a Hero-oriented, Hindi film"" than ""whoa! Didn't see that twist coming! Cool!!""The only thing ""cool"" about the film is the conceptualization of some of the scenes, in terms of post-production work, including editing. Rest is all blah comes and bigger blah goes. No, lines trying too hard to be cool dialogue don't count. That is, throwing in 'facebook','twitter','google' in a line won't make it hip and popular.That ""Abhishek Bachchan"" attitude has worn off long-long ago. What's the point of a pause in a sentence, if you can predict when it's going to come because you know the actor so well now? Prateik Babbar doesn't look one bit like the seventeen year old he plays. He tries to whine like one though. Rana literally looked like a block of moving wood which would making grunting, squeaky voices every once in a while. Bipasha Basu's role has absolutely nothing important about it.At some level, I guess the roles of everyone other than ACP Kamath (Abhishek Bachcan) were meant to create pathos for the plight of the Goan middle-class population stuck between a corrupt administrations and drug dealers. But, it just doesn't get there. It'd also have been interesting to see a couple of things explored further, for example, Kamath's misjudging people, or a misused woman's internal struggle. But that would be out-of-tone depth for such a superficial film. I mean, we are talking about an Additional Commissioner of Police breaking into rap while cleansing the streets of Goa. Where's the room for complexity and profundity here?Story-wise whatever there is to see in the film, you've already seen in the promos of the film or in a film from the 80s-90s. The only marvel is the use of color and light and the visual treatment given to some of the scenes.

252,350,350,350,350,Dumb and Dumber To,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/dumb-and-dumber-review/,,,,3.366666667,"Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, unbelievably, still seem in character 20 years later, in the sequel to the cult comedy Dumb and Dumber. Miraculously, they've gotten even dumber with age. Dumb and Dumber To is funny in spurts, but is mostly loud and ends up trying too hard. There's some fun to be had if you have fond memories of the first film, but watch it only when you're in the most forgiving mood, ready to laugh at the most offensive or juvenile jokes.","There is at least one generation amongst us that was (un)fortunate enough to have the Farelly brothers' Dumb and Dumber as a part of our growing up - a film that most of us remember as an audacious, politically incorrect hoot. And yes, some of us have actually spent a lot of time wondering, between Jim Carrey's Lloyd and Jeff Daniels' Harry, who is 'dumb' and who is 'dumber'.That generation probably is also the only target audience for the sequel that has come 20 years later. Harry and Lloyd are also 20 years older, and they seem much dumber, though no less adorable. Unfortunately, the generation that's around the same age as I was when the first film came out is also significantly smarter and so much more worldy wise than we who first saw and loved Harry and Lloyd. That could be one key reason why Dumb and Dumber To will not make the splash the earlier film did.Make no mistake, the sequel is as audacious and politically incorrect as the first film. It's just that the humour has gotten old - and I'm talking about stuff like a cat that farts bird feathers. No one is spared - old people, young women, animals, Canada - everyone is fair game for Harry and Lloyd. The duo are off on a journey to find Harry's daughter, who was given away for adoption as a child. Finding her is not easy at all, particularly because Harry and Lloyd have to deal with, well, themselves. There is just one reason to watch Dumb and Dumber To - or two reasons, actually - Carrey and Daniels. Both look much older now, but admirably, neither of them seems low on energy. They're always up there, giving every gag their all, even though there are only a handful of genuinely funny moments in the film, and most of these involve unusually clever writing and/or pop culture references. Breaking Bad fans, for instance, will surely cheer the brief scene that shows Harry's new roommate.The writing for the most part though, is puerile. There are times when the loose writing leads to scenes where a lot of noise is made on screen, but not a soul in the audience laughs. As I mentioned earlier, some of the humour is so obviously dated, that it doesn't even get points for trying.Some of the humour in the film is also genuinely offensive - so much that you'd need a hugely open mind to not get offended or disgusted. A lot of it is also sexual in nature, though the laughs derive from the fact that Harry and Lloyd are usually the last to figure it out.What's still great to see, however, is Harry and Lloyd's friendship. Dubious for the most, where you don't really know if they're actually friends or they're just too dumb to know any better, this was also a hallmark of the earlier film - the fact that when it comes to it, the pair will stand by each other and go to the moon to help the other. It's naïve and silly, but also a little sweet. There's solace in the fact that fondness, affection and love can transcend not just space and time, but IQ as well.But that's me being kind to characters that I'd always find it tough to be mean to. Dumb and Dumber To, propelled by two fine actors who let themselves go completely, is loud and sporadically funny. It works well for the sake of nostalgia, and may also make for a fun watch in a large group. Expecting anything more is akin to auditioning for a lead role in the film.

253,351,351,351,351,Dunkirk,Owner's Pride!,wogma review,/movie/dunkirk-review/,,,,3.366666667,"Dunkirk is probably the best movie I have seen this year. It’s got an edge-of-your-seat tension throughout. It’s well acted, well directed, and well written. It shows you all the horrors of war while depicting one of the biggest evacuations in history. An intense beginning, an action-packed middle, a perfect ending, along with the weight of being based on a true story, make this movie a brilliant watch.","Christopher Nolan strikes again with yet another engaging film. Dunkirk is a tense story about an evacuation that affected the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Only the first minute or two are spent in bringing you up to speed  about the situation, and from there on it’s just non-stop action and tension.It follows a few  different storylines, and handles them perfectly. When one storyline’s action subsides, we cut to another, which throws us back into a spiral of seemingly endless destruction.The plane scenes are easily my favourite. They are the most action-packed of them all - from the frustration of missing the German planes, to the relief after one is brought down. We follow an RAF pilot, Farrier (Tom Hardy), also known as Fortis 1, as he tries to defend the soldiers on Dunkirk beach from the German bombers. He is smart, brave, and has a brilliant presence of mind. What’s amazing about this is that all of this is understood with just one slick maneuver. From then on, you are completely invested in this character.Then there are the scenes with the civilian boat. We follow Mr. Dawson, his son, Peter, and Peter’s friend, George, on a quest to Dunkirk to save as many soldiers as possible. He’s a considerate, caring man, and knows a lot about planes. This is also evident from just one scene. This is one of Dunkirk’s many strong points. Every character’s traits are brought out from one single moment. A shining moment of glory for one character, and now we know all about this guy (Yes, “guy”. Not very many female actors with lines. I counted a total of two, with one line each. However, this is World War II, so...).The scenes on Dunkirk beach were the most tense of them all. You see the soldiers standing in line, waiting to get on a boat that will take them home. You want them to get home, but all hell breaks loose. Then it subsides, only to throw you back into that abyss of tension and destruction. And repeat.Nolan’s narrative style of non-linearity comes in handy, yet again. He'd be the last person to spoon-feed and yet you are thankful for the absence of , “THREE HOURS EARLIER” or “ONE DAY LATER”. He shows it to you, by replaying dialogue or by reusing shots. However, you don’t notice it much in the beginning, you figure it out eventually. The subtlety is even more pronounced in Dunkirk. Yes, I know, ironical, right?The only problem I had with the movie, and it’s very minor, is the music. Initially, it’s awesome. Hitchcockian, in a way: telling you of impending doom. However, it gets irritating. It’s constant ticking. “Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock.” Only ending at the very end, when everything is over. When you know it’s all over, you still hear the ticking, and you think, “What now?”Now, I know it says that the runtime is 120 minutes, but it really feels like 90 - at most. It moves fast, and keeps you on your toes. I was surprised when it seemed as if the movie was ending, because it felt like only ten minutes had passed! However, I did not look at my watch for fear of missing something.That makes Dunkirk  a must watch this weekend. I watched it in IMAX 2D, and it was worth it. I urge you spend as much as you can, because we need more movies like this, and not more from the Fast and Furious franchise.  We need more movies that make us think about human nature, and not movies about exploding cars. We need movies that tell us about the sacrifices made by all the people who go into war. We need movies that tell the world about all the men who fought for their nations. We need movies that tell us that war is not easy. We need movies like Dunkirk.

The characters are remarkably developed with about 10 minutes for each story. The subjects chosen are such that everyone is likely to enjoy at least half of the stories,"One of the main differentiating factors of short films is that they leave you with a punch line for closure. Now such lines do not necessarily work always. And that’s the case with these 10 short films too.As the titles depict, Dus Kahaniyaan is a kaleidoscope of images, stories, narrative styles, issues. Almost all of the ten stories are about loss - loss of love or blind faith or friendship or life itself. Each story has a theme of its own and a thick vein of sexual desire runs through more than half of them. I thought that watching ten stories at one go was a little exhausting. It was like having to start, accelerate, reach a high, shut-off, and restart all over again every ten minutes. I also thought the order in which the movies were placed was interesting. By the third film or so you are anticipating the punch and by the seventh one you can pretty accurately guess the twist. I think fewer movies wouldn't have given the audience the chance to guess and would have left a better impact. (Yeah, they would have to change the title song a bit.)Not to mention that we wouldn't have missed a couple of them anyways (Lovedale and Sex on the Beach). While I wouldn't take away marks for the concepts being weird, they just didn't go well with the general tone of the collection. Then there were a couple that were preachy (Zahir, Gubbare, and Rice Plate). But while Zahir keeps you guessing till the very end, the other two were saved from being boring by some brilliant acting.The veteran actors show how it's done. Shabana Azmi, Naseeruddin Shah, and Nana Patekar make you forget their status in the industry and empathize with the characters they play. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the rest of the cast. While some of them are a little above average, the rest are barely mediocre. Be that as it may, every story got you involved and established characters really well within the 10 minutes assigned to it. I found the lighting and the camerawork pretty distracting in a couple stories. Matrimony had absolutely unnecessary usage of handheld camera and bright background lights. On the other hand, the same effects created the required mood for High on the Highway and Rise and Fall. I liked the narrative techniques of these last two as well. As a movie buff, you couldn't have asked for a better deal. 10-in-1. But, like any equipment that boasts of being ""so many""-in-one, this one too is a jack of a few trades and a master of none.  Parental Guidance: Not only are the touched upon issues about adult relationships, there is a good amount of sexual content and quite a bit of violence.

Kudos to the 17 year-olds sitting beside me who were saying the lines before the actors in all the clichéd scenes, and obviously giggling at their victory at the most serious spots. Only the dialogues can be blamed when you identify with the situation but not the characters. Especially since the performances were not half bad. The sick PJs (poor jokes) - yeah that's how sick and poor they were - try their best to make your eyes roll. But we are not going to give them that satisfaction, are we?Jimmy Sheirgill looked awesome and does whatever justice can be done to the aweful lines given to him. You actually feel bad for the actor Jimmy than his character. While Neha Dhupia is certainly not the slimmest stick around, she has a certain Rubenesque appeal. Her costumes were outright gorgeous, especially the saris, and she carried them well too. Her performance is obviously not the best but the lady's skills are improving gradually.   It's not good enough if you have individual alright performances. A couple has to have chemistry. Now, screen chemistry is a very abstract term. But I think it can be described as a failure when you understand the tension between a husband and wife but you don't feel tense. You can see they are trying to be romantic but it doesn't strike a chord. Again I think the actors cannot be held entirely responsible here. I think it was more to do with the camera decisions. In most of the shots between the couple, or any twosome for that matter, the camera was on the speaker. The listener was seldom in the frame. It was almost like each person's lines were shot separately. Yet again, Om Puri is wasted in an inconsequential loud role and Kamini Khanna is shrill. Speaking of which, it felt like all side characters were conversing in the highest possible pitch. The transition from one story to another was jerky and clumsy. Not to mention that the side stories could have been completely avoided since they were never meant to be given adequate footage. Also, this ain't the best time to show our man - Tendulkar hitting fours and sixes. I don't blame the makers since I assume they finished filming long before the World cup debacle. Or maybe it is the right time to remind us of our glorious past. Oh, here I go again...The mediocre presentation of the songs makes you forget that they are actually worth listening to. The ""rang barse"" (from Silsila) type holi song doesn't work at all because the jealousy has no background.  The college kids' need to learn lip-synching. The situations were created in almost every song to fit with the lyrics. Its supposed to be the other way around. ""Tere bin"" is certainly the best of the lot though and made a lot more sense because of the sub-titles.The silver lining is that the mercury is close to 40 degrees out there and the cinema hall had functioning air-conditioners. I am sorry - the silver lining is that the movie is not pretentious at all. It is being marketed as ""a feel good movie"", so you know everything will sort itself out even before you buy your ticket. As a little bonus, I don't have to spend energy on trying hard not to give the story away. About those dialogue-writers-in-their-own-right-giggly-teens - we were in the first-day-first-show, so it was not like they were seeing it for the second time. Besides, who would want to? Unless they go again just to ogle at Jimmy and Neha.

And though it showcases the concerns in the cities, it is pertinent in the interiors of the country too. It is also hilarious at regular intervals. Especially Mohan Joshi's drunken scene. And what with Sanjay Dutt doing what we know him to do best - deliver dialogues in Mumbai-underworld fashion and time his lines perfectly. The other actors are barely bearable - with Malaika Arora's existence taking first place. So, the general idea and some of the details are right. But the individual stories chosen, which started off interestingly, became too sappy for my taste. And the other actors are barely bearable. The set-up of the stories, the reasons why the various characters take their loans and how they are unable to repay them is quite interesting. A different aspect is touched upon in each story. The plan for the recovery process is cute too, but the actual act is childish. And the final resolutions are so tacky and hurried that all the set-up seems like a complete waste. Also, it came across as if the writers were confused on what the purpose of the story was – was it to narrate how these four people went through the process of taking, defaulting and repaying their loans, or was it to showcase the transition of a person from the mafia? In trying to do both they had to deal with 5 plots which not only was too much taken on the plate but also lengthened the movie a bit much.Cinema as a source of education is taken way too seriously and yet the subject has been presented over-simplistically. And these put together actually undo what is actually entertaining in bits and pieces.

257,355,355,355,355,[The] Eagle,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/eagle-review/,,,,2.933333333,"From the director of The Last King of Scotland comes The Eagle, one of the most under-rated movies to release this week. An engaging adventure about two soldiers’ quest to retrieve a lost emblem across the highlands of Rome, this film could have turned out to be a real gem, with some effort in fleshing out the characters. Nevertheless, this film is still a safe bet at the movies, so give it a try.","You know a director has grabbed your attention well into his film, when you refuse to believe that a rustling behind the bushes is just a false alarm. Director Kevin McDonald successfully does that in one of the initial scenes in The Eagle and from there on, it’s an absorbing film throughout.McDonald already has a reputation as a director. He directed the Oscar winningThe Last King of Scotland besides the critically acclaimed State of Play. This time he’s tried his hand at a period drama. Based on the novel, The Eagle of The Ninth, this film is set in the year 140 AD, and tells the story of Marcus Aquila (Channing Tatum), a young Roman soldier who embarks on a quest to find his lost legion’s golden emblem, ‘the eagle’ which went missing some years ago. The emblem was defended by his father’s army - 5,000 soldiers - who are believed to have died in that conquest, after they tried to conquer British territory, outside the Roman empire. Several attempts were made to retrieve the men and the emblem they so proudly defended, but in vain. In fact, before Aquila, whoever embarked on a similar journey never returned alive.The film is a pure adventure and one that’s fraught with challenges of trust, endurance, hunger and survival from the enemy of tribals. Aquila, is joined by a Brit, Esca (Jamie Bell) who despite being a prisoner of war, is sworn to loyalty as a slave.I loved this contrast between the two characters - the Roman Aquila takes the help of his enemy, a Brit (Esca) to find an emblem that matters only to the Romans. Esca’s characterisation is wonderful and it shows remarkable colours during their journey together, often surprising us and convincing us that humanity always triumphs over evil.I’d have liked it if Aquila’s character had been fleshed out a little better - what makes him so passionate about retrieving the legion? What was his life like after his father disappeared in that infamous incident and how did he train to be so strong? Some history to how Esca became a slave amongst the Romans would also have added some meat to the screenplay, especially during their journey together.Stories which are about the search for something precious, something that was lost and retrieved, must build enough cause into the conquest. For example, why is the Eagle emblem so important? Why does the honour of the empire matter so much? The result is a very flat, wooden story of two men searching for something and an army determined not to let them have it. It’s entertaining alright, and their journey is very watchable. What wrecks me is that this could have turned out from being merely a good film, to a really good film, with just a little more effort.The action scenes, the slow-mo are well-choreographed. Tatum looks a lot like Owen Wilson (without the broken nose) and I felt he’s a bit wooden throughout the film. If there’s one thing I’d change about this film, it would be Tatum - he seems like the wrong choice for the lead role.Costume dramas have this ability to transport you into a different world. This film tries to, but right from the first shot, there seems something odd. I wondered whether the actors were doing a dress rehearsal, because the actors’ dialogues do not have an ancient stamp about them. Also, after being on the road for so many days, how come Aquila and Esca don’t grow a beard? It’s what I call, ‘typos’ in a film.Despite these drawbacks, The Eagle is still worth a visit. It may not register as a movie you’d remember for a long time, but it is engaging in a good way, while it lasts.

258,356,356,356,356,Eat Pray Love,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/eat-pray-love-review/,,,,2.933333333,"At some point, every hotel lobby, airplane seat pocket, pirated street book seller and the bestseller section in bookstores had a copy of Eat Pray Love. Honestly, the book was indulgent and extremely disconnected. The movie Eat Pray Love however, works as a soul-searching travelogue because of its visual prowess. It’s a pretty picture and it instills a dream within you – you can choose to rubbish it as ridiculously over-achieved or harmless wishful thinking. ","The difference between being an adult and wishing you were still a school/college going child is ""wishful thinking"". As an adult it’ll always be the unachievable ridiculous thought that you had – and as a child, it would be a fantasy. A world, which you know with all your might that you’ll reach to. Eat Pray Love in some parts becomes that for you, as an audience, to wish and dream for a soul-searching journey across three countries (Italy, India and Thailand).Almost Julia Roberts’ comeback movie (after a couple of forgotten appearances, like in Ocean’s Eleven, Valentine’s Day) in Eat Pray Love, she plays Elizabeth Gilbert, a New York based travel writer who has a dream life – money, success and a marriage, but is confused and not happy. As a newly divorced, directionless single woman, she decides to spend four months each in Italy, India and Bali to find herself – or maybe achieve answers to questions she’s not yet formed.Through her journey, we learn that nothing about getting out of your comfort space and moving to different cultures is easy. While we can relate to the Indian part of her journey, it seems mortifying to live in a tight neighborhood in Rome, with scrapping wallpaper, middle-finger-showing 7 year-olds and men who grope your bottom as a tradition. And yet, Rome becomes for Gilbert the ""Eating"" part of her discovery. She eats; to learn about surroundings, to mingle with warm, new friends and to be happy. Elizabeth’s next stop is an Ashram in India – possible her toughest 4 months, but most rewarding. We see her grapple with her stability issues and find her sense of self. She meets Richard (played by the charming Richard Jenkins), a Texan with alcohol issues who comes to the Ashram for similar reasons. Their chemistry is delightful; right up Roberts’ alley of being a stimulating co-actor with older men (Pretty Woman, Erin Brokovich).It’s in Bali, that she finds balance – in the form of Love. She meets Felipe. Javier Bardem is easily the best part about the film, with his calm, endearing demeanour. Elizabeth falls in love with Felipe. You ask no questions there, because it seems so easy to fall in love with Felipe, a music composer set in Bali. Full credit goes to Ryan Murphy (also co-writer of the film) to make her entire experience extremely live-able. Every bite she takes of the Spagetti and Pizza Margherita in Rome, you can feel her insides thanking her for it. Every calm breath she takes in the serene ashram in India, at the backdrop of colorful marriages and children running behind tires, you live the moment with her. You fall in love with Felipe too, and there lies your ability to wishfully want to Eat, Pray, and Love.The movie has beautiful photography, featuring gorgeous shots of the Colloseum, the Tuscan countryside, even the food Gilbert eats. The cinematography in India wasn’t as colorful and explored as I would have hoped, but it more than makes up for that folly in Bali – which almost looks like a beach-heaven. Coupled with culturally appropriate background scores (Opera-esque husky vocals in Rome, the Sitar in India and a calm Harp chime in Bali) and Eat Pray Love makes for a beautiful picture. The DVD has 5 minutes of extra footage – mostly of Gilberts’ discovery process of each country. It also contains a featurette with Ryan Murphy about his experience with the film. You wouldn’t miss either of the two.Unlike the book, which seems like a rich New Yorker’s extremely convenient travelogue about whining her way to balance, Eat Pray Love the movie genuinely allows you to travel with the protagonist. You don’t address the underlying questions through the film, the same questions (Where does she get the money? How can she just walk out on her life and expect the world to fall at her feet?) that nag you while reading the book. These questions however, fundamentally bind Eat Pray Love. Every now and then, it will come back to you in some form. You will want to criticize the film for being a Cinderalla book, and too romantic. But that’s exactly when you know the adult in you is talking.Take your pick. You could question, criticize and flinch at the idealism in the film or you could get inspired and paint your own travelogue.

259,357,357,357,357,Edge of Tomorrow,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/edge-tomorrow-review/,,,,2.933333333,"Doug Liman's Edge of Tomorrow is a nicely executed action sci-fi flick, one which benefits from its brisk pace and the exciting lead pair of Tom Cruise & Emily Blunt. Cruise's humour works well, as do the action scenes.   ","The guilty pleasure of the summer is here. Doug Liman's Edge of Tomorrow is about as much fun as one can have with a sci-fi action flick starring Tom Cruise. Based on a Japanese novel titled 'All You Need is Kill' (which was also the supposed title of the film for a while, before the current name was settled upon), the movie feels like a mash-up of a number of films, including Source Code, Groundhog Day, Starship Troopers, Independence Day and even a little bit of 2013's Oblivion, also starring Cruise.In many ways, this film is also like an equal and opposite mirror image of Oblivion. If that film showed Earth as a vast, beautiful but desolate canvas, with just one man and one woman, Edge of Tomorrow introduces us to Earth as a frenzied and ugly battleground; but again, with one man and one woman at the centre of it all.With its quite relentless pace, some daringly sharp editing, and a terrific lead pair in the form of Cruise and the gorgeous Emily Blunt, Edge of Tomorrow makes for an engaging actioner; one which makes you gloss over its weaknesses because of how smartly it tackles the rather outrageous story at hand. US Army Major William Cage unexpectedly finds himself in the middle of a war in Europe, against an invading alien race, and as he reluctantly goes at it, he ends up in the strangest of predicaments - he is stuck in a time loop, where he wakes up at the exact same point everytime he dies. The only option he has now is to continue living that day over and over again.One of the big question marks raised early in the film is why Cage is made to go to this war at all. It is never fully explained, and it is about the only time in the film you get time to question any of its logic. Once he's in the middle of it, the pace of the film never lets you pause to ask questions. In these time-loop scenarios, one of the biggest worries one faces as an audience is the reason for the time loop occurrence. Luckily, not only is the reason for it in Edge of Tomorrow satisfactory, it is also quite believable in the larger scheme of things. And one of the big, intriguing mysteries of the film, something that no one will ever have the answer to, is how many times does William Cage actually live that day? A hundred time? A thousand times? Even more? We can't tell, and that makes the film so much more enigmatic, because Cage is the only one living that day over and over again. For the rest of the world, at the end of all of it, just one day has passed.The humorous undercurrent throughout the film is a great help, as is some terrifically staged action. Even though some of it can be visually overwhelming and tough to follow (particularly in 3D), the film has an action film heart, and it sticks to it admirably.One does miss a truly impactful and memorable background score, however, which is so important in a film like this. Apart from its rampaging action and sci-fi leanings, the film is also ultimately about unsung heroes and a strange sort of doomed love story. With big-scale films like Edge of Tomorrow, such emotions stay with you much after a film only if it has a powerful music score to go back to. Unfortunately, the film's music is purely functional.Cruise and Blunt, of course, rank among the best things in the film. They react to each other like firecrackers, and it is a pleasure to see a female character in a big action film get so much scope to perform action - almost as much as her co-star. Edge of Tomorrow can be taken to the cleaners if one truly wants to - films in the action sci-fi genra can almost always be torn apart for logic. But sometimes a film is so blatantly honest in its intentions, that you're willing to let it have its way. Edge of Tomorrow is an enjoyable film multiple times over; and I suspect it will make for fun repeat viewing as well.

S S Rajamouli has proved yet again that he can do no wrong.,"When S S Rajamouli announced that he is going to make a revenge saga of a housefly and that too not on the lines of Bug’s life, I was appalled to say the least. Now how can a tiny insect attempt to kill a man? Even if he had chosen the blood sucking mosquito as his protagonist there could be some plausibility to the idea. But this is from the director who convinced everyone south of vindhyas of a warrior who could fight and win over 100 soldiers at a time. S S Rajamouli the director with the Midas touch sure must have known what he was doing. The end result is a buzzy little creature called Eega (Housefly) that could give bumblebee a run for its honey at being audaciously capable of doing the impossible.In its screen time of 2+ hours, Eega not just defies almost all laws of nature, but also breaks tons of clichés associated with a masala film while proudly being one. For one, though the title role of Eega is the star of the film, the film relies primarily on its antagonist’s angst against the petite fly, portrayed menacingly by Sudeep (known to the Hindi audience through Phoonk). Notwithstanding the fact that his role is modeled on the character Raghuveer (from Magadheera – another Rajamouli film) Sudeep is able to infuse a different persona which effectively evokes sympathy for a computer generated Fly.While Sudeep gets to be a livewire, Samantha unlike the heroines in a superhero/masala film gets to be more than the trusted aide to the efficacious fly. This is a far cry from the heroines of the director’s previous films, who were deployed mainly to paint the screen with voyeurism. (Rajamouli is the man behind the original version of now successful Rowdy Rathore).For a movie that revolves around three principle characters, S S Rajamouli should be applauded for intelligently intertwining their actions that test one another’s strengths and weaknesses, to move the plot forward. But for a movie that is targeting all ages, it is unabashedly gory, a point that parents of toddlers should think over before taking them to the silver screen. Not only that, the glorified-immature romance that play out in the first few minutes of the film lurks us back to the films in 80s, where men were loafers  pursuing the job of wooing the heroine.These slight glitches apart, S S Rajamouli can be proud of creating a fantasy film without compromising on the Indian sensibilities, that is going to make film lovers throughout the world turn their attention towards India and Indian cinema. In line with the famous Tamil saying, S S Rajamouli & his Eega have certainly proved that ‘Vallavanukku pullum ayudham’ (even a blade of grass is a weapon for the victor).

Reminds you of the trashy Hindi films from yesteryears that you love because of their silliness.,"I suspect the director had a deprived past. He was shown movies that lacked the slo-mo stylization of the ""star"". Also he felt disadvantaged when the writers didn't spell out how a particular thing ""happened"" in a film. So much so that when he saw it for the first time, he decided, ""I swear by everyone dear to me, I'll make sure the viewers don't feel left-out. I'll explain in detail in flashbacks what just happened two minutes ago. It'll also have so much unnecessary style that no child will have to suffer like me."" Only that hopefully, the child in you has grown enough to keep your kids away from Ek. But, if you enjoy the absurdity that our films come up with more often than not, then this is your dose of nirvana. I kid you not; Bobby Deol doesn’t have a single regular speed shot or a normally delivered dialogue till minute 40. Complete with loud, pompous background music, weird camera movements and all. The style goes for about a minute and come right back. Maybe that's what the title refers to. O-kay, I'm exaggerating one tiny bit. And just in case you are wondering, they weren't partial to Bobby Deol, they had a bit of that going for each of the other main characters. As promised though Nana Patekar does come in a different, ""cool"" avatar. His casual manner of saying lines adds that required touch of humor. It does require some finesse to deliver such crass lines with charm. While I'm at giving credit where it's due, there are a couple of smart lines when Nandu (Bobby Deol) talks to Joshi (Raghuveer Yadav). All of this is nullified and taken further down with one tiring monologue after monologue, especially towards the end. None of the other characters are fleshed out. They all are just a part of your regular Punjabi family. No creativity at all. The loud women, one quiet lady, the giggling girls, the over-smart kids, the annoying lead actress, the cunning good-for-nothings. And yes the completely avoidable Chunkey Pandey! Yet, the writing is not a 100% loss. The transition in Bobby Deol's character is pretty smooth. And yet, it’s a far cry from believable. It comes across as the start of a good thought that didn't go all the way to completion. Just like it is neither a full-fledged comedy, nor a romantic film, nor an action, nor a thriller. A bit of each of these and incomplete in all of them. It serves as a strong reminder of the films in which masala was of utmost importance. This has that too, but again, not in full strength and thus doesn't leave a good aftertaste.

However, a good dose of imaginative comedy is blemished by dark comedy that generally does not suit my taste. Overall, though the way the different plots are put together is original and is worthy of appreciation. The makers' courage deserves extra points.","Don't let the video of the promotional song put you off. This is a brave directorial debut and most certainly not cheesily picturized. I am willing to take a bet that the said video was made by a completely different set of people - marketing MBAs in all likelihood. People, who for some reason think bright colors and half-naked women is the only thing that can get us to the theater. Originality executed even reasonably well is so hard to come by, that if you spot one from a mile, it deserves enthusiastic support. The freshness lies in the way the vaguely familiar stories are sewn together. The clever dialogues giving company all along. The way the complex plot unfolds and transitions from one sub-plot to another without once taxing the brains of the viewer is enticing. Sitting on the edge of the seat gives me a backache, otherwise that is what I would be doing through most of it. And just when you feel, ""okay, one more sub-plot might make this whole thing go over-board"", the movie ends. The writer had the balance just right. So, bonus marks just for the guts it takes to do something like this. Of course, a perfect product is hard to come by too. So there are a few things amiss. The one that strikes the most is the lead pair's performance. They are not completely off, but don't have the whole range either - be it expressions, body language, voice modulation. And that nags through to the end. The supporting cast though, barring the shrieking vamp, gives creditworthy support. I also had issues with the unnecessarily tilted camera angle which was over-used to the verge of nausea in the first half. Throughout the movie though, there were these little things that kept me in splits. Sound effects used to exaggerate the going-ons took the cake. Creative slapstick is welcome, especially if the dosage is really low. Similarly, the background music absolutely complemented the pace of the movie. Particularly, the car chases where Pulp-Fiction-inspired strings play - an apt tribute. In fact, a lot of the ""style"" looks like it is inspired/derived from Pulp Fiction. The creativity with which some of the humor was infused in the story was brilliant. Alas, there is a largish measure of dark comedy that neither provoked nor tickled. It existed and thus it was watched.  Thus, the comedy that works, works really well but is appalling when it's crude. Interestingly, the pace was very much like riding on a Mumbai local train. Takes off slowly, gathers momentum, goes to top speed and stays there till the destination arrives where it slows down for a short while before the credits start rolling. If the symbolism was intentional, I thoroughly enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek humor. But, was it worth the risk - having a thriller start off and land at a sluggish pace? A good 10 minutes out of the first half hour and another 5 minutes of the last 15-20 minutes could have been edited out. If the symbolism is a fabrication of my imagination - oh well, I deserve points for coming up with the analogy!

It's a good thing that those one-liners and the timing with which they are delivered, are perfect. And though almost the entire film is predictable, the climax deviates from the ""regular"" zone making the film two notches above what it might've been, as promised. The problem though is that the narrative throughout the film, seems drab and flat, and thus the film stays average. For all we know, it could be intentional because the film advocates being average.  In that sense,  Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is more about parenting styles, the generation gap a restrictive style could create and society's constant insistence on being unique.

Kareena Kapoor with her chirpy Riana Briganza is exactly Geet (Jab We Met) and she has always been a joy to watch. Especially, since she has mastered the art of stopping her 'happy' act where it might get 'trying to hard' and thus annoying. Such people in real life, do get overbearing, after all. Imraan Khan as the wannabe anal retentive, but easily slips into any form the other person wants him to take, does represent a section of our youth who are figuring out their identity. This lost identity bit makes the chemistry between the two fizzle off since most of the time, it feels like Riana is coaching Rahul as an older sister would. And automatically that converts Rahul into a younger brother because the mold his character is capable of shaping into, instantly wants him to be like her, like a younger sibling aspires to be like the older one. While  Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu might deviate from the standard at some places, at various others it takes on every new-world cliché that we have been exposed to in the past decade or so. The extra-aspirational parents to the 'everything goes' parents - are all caricatures. Not to mention all of them are given either exaggerated situations or are over-acting. We also cannot deny that the 100%-guaranteed-chirpy-woman-of-the-film is also quickly falling into the cliché zone. Sure, we all know enough of this type of a person. But now, her sole aim is to bring about a change in the typical, serious man of the film. And that's getting repetitive across films. Yet, I will look forward to director, Shakun Batra's next film. There were some strokes in character establishment that showed a glimpse of hope. Like the background music in the opening scene or the characters' self-description at the psychologists. Of course, there is naiveté in other directorial decisions like say the whole Day 1 - Day X super-imposes. One - bad lift-off from 500 days of Summer; Two - why take on something like this if you're not going to use it wittingly throughout, are going to club days and give it the lamest every conclusion!In many ways,  Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is a trying hard to be Wake Up!

But it's nowhere close to what its predecessor achieved. The one change is sweet and such shifts need to be encouraged because they draw from real life, but I've seen real-life situations which panned out with a lot more heart-tugging.

265,363,363,363,363,Ek Tara,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review,/movie/ek-tara-review/,,,,3.2,Needlessly eccentric and stupid. This is an Avdhoot Gupte film. What else do you expect?,"Avadhoot Gupte must be a relieved man now. After all, Ek Tara is out in theatres after a year-long battle with the censors. This reason is enough to pep up the filmmaker in him momentarily, but not the audience in you. If he continues to bring films he is notorious for making, you’ll be doomed to disappointment time and again. His latest film is indeed an epic of sorts. After all, when was the last time Gupte’s film left you in the middle of complexity, stupidity and often nowhere?Gupte’s debut feature, Zenda, was surely a brave take on a political feud between two cousins. His subsequent venture, Morya, delicately portrayed various issues surrounding Ganesh pandals in Bombay. While both the films act purposefully, they had their flaws and dullness. Never mind what happened to his raunchy love story Jai Maharashtra Dhaba, Bhatinda. Just like any other Avadhoot Gupte film, Ek Tara too has an extremely intense premise. But unlike any other Avadhoot Gupte film, this one dies from the first scene and appears futile throughout.Ek Tara (a star) deals with the rise and fall of a singer, similar to Imtiaz Ali’s Rockstar. Co-writers Gupte and Sachin Darekar this time choose non-linear narrative (Ali’s distinctive style) to keep you engaged. Sadly, the storytelling is so vague that you get bored too quickly and you often compare it with the Rockstar. Well; Rockstar itself was far from perfect, nonetheless this comparison reaches to a point where you feel totally disconnected with the on-screen drama. Not only does Ek Tara lack the magnitude of Ali’s vision, but it also miserably fails in gratifying you.The biggest dilemma the film endures is the absence of motivation in its writing, which eventually leads to irksome execution. Consider this, the folk singer aka Mauli comes to Bombay to enter a music reality show. Odds are against him. A mean-looking channel head – who possibly has nothing else to do – lends him a hand. And he wins the competition despite his absurd style. He becomes an overnight success. This innocent guy suddenly turns into an eccentric, rampant and careless character for no apparent reason. One thing leads to another and all hell breaks loose. But why and how? If Ek Tara’s tagline is anything to go by, it is supposed to be a journey of a star. But where is that journey of his rise or may be even fall? The director might argue saying the character’s journey lies in between. However, his hastily-presented rise barely explains anything. Neither do you find enough justification for his fall, which begins with a silly set of events.Forced comedy and badly written dialogues add to your misery.Santosh Juvekar is a versatile actor. Yet, his poorly-shaped character sometimes comes across as whiny and a rowdy at other times. You feel nothing about his misery or glory. This makes the film lose the battle halfway.Considering the storyline, Ek Tara had every scope of becoming a musical extravaganza. The music is undoubtedly good, but it falls short of intensifying Mauli’s character or the situations he is stuck in. The not-so-exceptional camerawork doesn’t help the film either.Apart from a thing or two, this film proves to be one big cliché.

A little less buffoonery, a little more story. A little less Salman than we expect, a little more Katrina than we expect. Ek Tha Tiger ends up being a regular love story with a national angle and will in all likelihood be underwhelming for the fans.","I love it when a film shows most of what is covered in the promos in the first few minutes of the film. That means they haven’t given away too much and I have a lot of new stuff to look forward to. But, of course, I shouldn’t have begun to hope because the twists of Ek Tha Tiger are clear from a mile away. The rest of the story is just another love story, this once, masked under the guise of feuding nations, instead of feuding families. The ‘message’ being of international peace. Thankfully, the message isn’t drilled down in preachy dialogue. Yet, the dialogue isn’t what one is used to in a Salman film - oozing of style and filminess. Not that that makes the dialogue subtle or likeable. It is just plain lines trying their best to make an impact. Unsuccessfully.This failure has nothing to do with Salman Khan’s usual lack of emotion in dialogue. Nor does it have anything to do with Katrina’s reversion to lifeless dialogue delivery (which is sad to watch.) The writing just doesn’t carry that kind of weight or charm. Every time, you think there might be a decent ‘moment’ coming up, you are let down by something very ordinary. The heart vs. brain dilemma or even the interesting crossroads that India and Pakistan’s intelligence agencies find themselves in is a very thin thread to hook your interest on. But hey, what do you need any of that for when you have two of the best-looking people in the industry filling every frame of the screen. Interestingly, Ek Tha Tiger, unlike most Salman films or even action films, gives the lead lady a lot to play with and a lot more screen time. A welcome change, however wasted it might have been rendered by Katrina Kaif’s emotionless, heavily made up, facial muscles - almost as if she was directed to match Salman’s attempt at acting.The songs too have very little Salman about them. They look and sound like any other regular masala flick. Except for ‘mashaallah’ which you have to wait for until the end credits. The question then remains – should they have attempted to have a coherent story when they didn’t intend to make anything substantial, impactful or entertaining about it? Or should they have simply stuck to what Salman Khan fans enjoy best - mindless action. The action too is more or less lackluster, except for the chase sequence in the climax. Seeing a woman in a Hindi film do cat-like moves is entertaining, alright. But, of course, they had to go ahead and spoil it by some awful use of what looks like green screen and shoddy post-production work. Ek Tha Tiger is an underwhelming experience for a neutral party like me. But going by the fact that I heard almost all dialogue and none of it died down with whistles and cheers tells me that would be a fan’s take too.Oh yes, ladies, you do get a glimpse of a shirtless Salman Khan. Fine, gents too.

Unfortunately, it goes only down after interval. Yet, there are a few genuine scares and good performances. A casual DVD watch.","I wonder if a ghost/witch story is, by default, a good vs. evil (pun intended) story. Ek Thi Daayan tries to underline it further, if possible. The able cast and gripping first hour, unfortunately, can't do much for the dwindling, unwieldy second hour. Yet, it is not your typical Hindi horror film, it does manage to get you nervous a few times.The first half has a lovely build-up indeed. It is interesting to see the creative interpretation of a child. I also loved the way it keeps you hanging between a child's imagination and that you don't want to believe it. Even so, a connect with the characters is missing. You don't know why you are supposed to feel for this cool magician who seems to be disturbed by some hallucinations. You don't know why you should care for this couple. The backstory comes, but a little too late for you to go back and have feelings for the characters. Also, whatever emotional attachment you are made to have is more because there are children whose safety is  involved. But, that doesn't last too long. Yet, you are gripped by the situation in the backstory. Another major contributor to keeping you rooted to your seat is the cast. All the main leads from the kids to Emraan Hashmi perform well. Can't say the same about the supporting actors, especially Pawan Malhotra or Rajatava Dutta. The kids on the other hand Vishesh Tiwari who plays the young Bobo (Emraan Hashmi) and his younger sister behave like children would and that is always refreshing to see in our films.Thankfully, there is one thing you come out with and it is Konkana Sen Sharma's haunting face. As much credit to the makeup and special effects department as it to her naturally beautiful eyes and her use of them. Emraan Hashmi gets to play the quintessential spooked out guy, in this horror film. So he gets spooked, alright. Huma Qureshi has a more or less plain role and does whatever little she can do with it. Kalki Koechlin has the smallest roles of them all, but she creates an intrigue about herself that is consistent. The inconsistency is all reserved for the last hour of the film which comes with random songs and even worse twists. At the end of the film, there are few sub-plots that make you wonder why they found a place in the film at all. On the other hand, there are some themes that are touched upon but left half-done, like a child's dreamy world, or the struggle between good and bad or logic and faith.And as is usual with all horror films, why don't witches and ghosts go directly for the kill, instead of trying to warm their subject up to themselves or killing random people associated with subject rather than the subject themselves. In that sense then, Ek Thi Daayan is like any other horror film. Thankfully, it varies from them in that it tries to stay clear of the standard mechanisms of horrifying - loud background score, etc. It also does creep you every once in a while. If only, the climax was at interval point.

With a hero that you hardly care for, a lead lady that is carved out to be too sweet to be true and a villain who hardly has a menacing strain in him, Ek Villain is a revenge saga that works so hard in trying to make you feel for the characters that it fails and you are left gaping at the screen in bewilderment for over two hours.The main culprit is too much backstory. Too much backstory about the lead characters and too much backstory about the villain. Serial killers are serial killers because they are serial killers. They don't really need a reason to be so. I know I have always been a fan of grey characters, but this one just doesn't work here. His reasons are not convincing, and thus only end up being a distraction from his ""villainy"". I was intrigued when the movie started with what looked like the climax. It is very difficult to pull off a thriller when the audience knows a lot of what happens. And difficult it stays, for Ek Villain. There is very little effort put into making the dynamics of how the situation reached the stage of this particular climax interesting. While the movie starts with a bang and a lot happens story-wise too, it reaches a lull soon enough.It is then left to the actors to keep things going. Of the lot, only Siddharth Malhotra with his limited range of expressions came across as closest to natural. Both Shraddha Kapoor and Riteish Deshmukh are trying too hard to be chirpy and villainous respectively, to be effective. You could say they tried to do their bit well, in terms of trying to perform. But cute turned shrill and annoying and villainous actually made me laugh more than once. Yet, I am glad Riteish Deshmukh tried something different from slapstick. Here's to more such attempts. The film is also very loud, in general, with almost one or the other character shouting under the guise of being full of life or full of anger. It doesn't help that the characters are voicing out their thought instead of showing them with action. We know a lot of the villain's characters from their own description of themselves to others, as a monologue.I don't even want to get into the logical gaps in the film. These are clearly things that the makers wanted to take the audience for granted about. Most of them are quick fixes to get from one situation to another. There is this slight sliver of story that might have worked had energies not been spent in making the story non-linear. The story had enough meat, even without the backstories, to make for a decent film. But, it just doesn't work out with the combination of the performances, the side-tracks the story takes, the songs and dances. Quirks like Kamaal R Khan's character are more irritating than anything else, though it does mean he played it well.  Yet, that doesn't make its inclusion an advantage for the film.Saying that this story had potential is giving it a little more credit than it deserves because a lot of it needed to be edited out rather than just changed. We'll continue to wait for a good thriller to come our way.

And an attempt to mask stiff, expressionless actors with awful makeup and even worse dubbing. ","In the spirit of full disclosure, the 8.30 AM show I was booked for was cancelled due to a technical glitch. The 11 AM show that I rebooked myself for, started at 11.50. So bear in mind that I had a mighty, almost 4-hour long frustration pent up.Even so, finally when the trailers before the show began, I dutifully reminded myself. ""It's not the makers' fault. It's not Prateik Babbar's fault that he can't act the show didn't start on time."" As the film reels on, I tell myself, ""Oh don't be so harsh even though you can do better make-up with your recently acquired knowledge about lip shades and sundry. This is a regional film trying to reach out to a wider audience. Accept those sensibilities."" And stop talking to yourself. With that reprimand in about the 15th minute of the film, I promise to give the film a fair chance. But Ek Deewana Tha didn't want it. I was allowing myself to acknowledge that problems with inter-religion marriages persist and are not bygones of the 80s and 90s, even if we claim to have embraced the 21st century; that there is something very sweet and innocent about 'love at first sight' even if it is by a character you couldn't care for. I'm not going to be judgmental about what a good-for-nothing he is. I appreciate that having been fed on characters that are white or black, it's natural for me to get annoyed by a lead lady who is thoroughly confused about her priorities in life. It does happen in real life, doesn't it? And then, I gave up. Groping for slivers of hope isn't good enough. The actors have to look and feel real. Awful dialogue delivery + awful dubbing + awful make-up = total exasperation. In addition, this romantic film grows twists and turns, one would tire of, even in a thriller. More on that later. First, please tell me there is some news byte, somewhere, that talks about how director, Gautham Menon repents the choice of Prateik Babbar and Amy Jackson. I haven't seen any of his Tamil films but I'm told that the Ek Deewana Tha's original is an amazingly touching film.We could even have blamed Amy Jackson's dubbing for the lack of variation in intonation, but any one fish from Finding Nemo is more expressive than her and Pratiek Babbar put together. It's a miracle then, that there were a couple of scenes that make you sense a spectacular moment between the two. There was even a misplace but well-done father-son scene between Sachin Khedekar and Prateik BabbarJust when you are beginning to get hopeful about some click between chemistry and biology, you are cut rather rudely into the next scene and land into the next abrupt event in the leads pair's life. The background music adds to the chops from one scene to another and sometimes dishevels you bang in the middle of a film. That coming from a film touted as a musical by A. R. Rahman and Javed Akhtar. I don't know about them or Gautham Menon or the genius marketing team that came up with that tag-line, but my head hangs in shame. What could still have been a sweet film in the blast-from-the-plast kind-of a way completely lost it in the last half an hour or so. In its attempt to do something different from the regular love story, we have writers going amok and finally confusing themselves like their lead character about what they want out of this film. The climax is such a cheat that one's you are through with it you realize, the relaxed, build-up of the whole film was with only this purposed in mind, as if all the writing energies were focused only on making the audience guess and double-guess. You realize that the first two hours of the film had nothing really going in them or for them. I started out, hoping that I wouldn't let the frustration from the delay of the show come in my way of enjoying a romantic film. As I recount the things that went wrong, I wonder if some of you might think that I allowed that to come in my way of being completely disappointed.

But, there are too many holes in the story which keep you from enjoying the experience. Overall, I was disappointed. I didn't like the way the story was narrated. The style gave away what was to come next and that was anti-climatic. The last 15-20 minutes were just unbearable and unacceptable from this banner.","It is amazing how so much ground is covered at such a slow pace in less than two hours. More movie-makers need to learn this trick. And it is all with a lot of style. But, as a thriller, it fails. There are no major twists in the plot, given the situation you know exactly how the said character is going to react. And the last scene is painfully silly. However, if the technical aspects like the action and stunts, the cinematography, the camera movements interest you; it is certainly worth a watch. The unique treatment of the titles grabs attention. The first 15-20 minutes raise curiosity but are what I call ‘over-produced’ - dramatic entries of characters, too much background music, and the urge to do something “different” in every frame shows. The actual story unfolds gradually and during the interval you are thinking, “it’s okay so far, let’s see how it goes”. And then come the dialogues repeated for impact - okay, I am exaggerating - only one dialogue is repeated…but, thrice. To my credit though, it was not just me, the whole auditorium gave an exasperated  “ohhh”, the third time. And the word “dharm” is heard one too many times. The unique characteristics of Amitabh Bachchan’s character are repeated till you learn them by heart. And then comes the climax where I said almost blurted out, “You gotta be kidding me! The maker of Parinda and 1942 – A love story ended his movie like this?!”The performances are awesome. Once again, you forget that this is the Amitabh Bachchan on screen. He looks and feels the character. The screen presence he has in some scenes, by just standing there without a single line to deliver, is just amazing. Everyone else has done their job to perfection too. But, if I want to watch a recent movie of Amitabh Bachchan in a serious role, I would watch the second half of Babul again. If I want to watch Saif Ali Khan as an angry character I would rather watch Omkara again. Sanjay Dutt, obviously does well as the comic relief, but if I want to laugh with him, I will watch Lage Raho Munnabhai again and again. Ditto for Vidya Balan, who with full grace, takes care of the mandatory romantic angle.The flaws in the screenplay are too many and end up distracting you from the visual treat. Same story with a lot more detailing and by a Vidhu Vinod Chopra from ten years ago - we might have had a better experience.

271,369,369,369,369,Elizabeth Ekadashi,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewNotepad,/movie/elizabeth-ekadashi-review/,,,,2.466666667,The same old story. Just presented beautifully.,"Paresh Mokashi’s first film Harishchandrachi Factory depicted Dadasaheb Phalke’s struggle to make India's first motion picture, Raja Harishchandra. It was a fascinating story presented in a disappointing manner. His second venture – Elizabeth Ekadashi, portrays a family’s struggle to overcome mounting financial woes. Their efforts to survive and lead a normal life could’ve made a more engaging, heartwarming film. Instead, the director presents you a plot that is predictable at every juncture.The film is about a family that gets into an unexpected financial problem. A widowed mother, the sole breadwinner of the family, strives hard to get themselves out of this dilemma. Her kids, however, decide to take matters in their own hands and support their mother. We all know the story and what will happen next and thereafter. Yet, you will be surprised to see how beautifully Madhugandha Kulkarni’s story is woven around Elizabeth – a cycle, and Ashadhi Ekadashi (an auspicious day). That’s why, no matter how conventional the narrative is, I don't worry about it as long as the treatment is heeded to.Now, this cycle called Elizabeth was gifted to Dnyanesh (a lead character) by his late father. As does every human being, this family and above all Dnyanesh finds an emotional bond with it. Mokashi captures this affection so wonderfully that you’ll yearn for more. Alas, his weakest directional side spoils the whole show. Over-explanatory dialogues and over-exaggerated performances were the biggest bummer for Harishchandrachi Factory. And you get to see that imprint in Elizabeth Ekadashi as well. It’s really hard to understand why Indian filmmakers question our sensibilities rather than challenging them. Why can’t they let us feel the story rather than describing it to us through dialogue?Mokashi once again failed to take advantage of his talented, charming cast. Their unnecessarily staged, not-so-natural performances make you think if the director really wanted it that way for this film or he prefers it this way by default. The characters’ struggle is evident throughout the film. You feel nothing about them though. As a result, you don’t desperately want the protagonist to succeed in his endeavors. Because somewhere you know he might win anyway. Mokashi tries to throw in a few surprises, but he is very late. His predictable screenplay has already done the job.At 90 minutes, it might look like the film is short and crisp. But a sharper edit could’ve surely helped to disguise its glitches. Mokashi had an opportunity to show a cinematic climax that would’ve left audiences speechless. It’s a shame that he chose an absolutely passé one. Above all, it is so casually directed that it makes me wonder if he was the same guy whose last film was India's official entry to Academy Awards.Amol Gole’s cinematography isn't ground-breaking, but it is not something I've seen in Marathi films in recent times. Each scene is lit so brilliantly that it adds to the intensity of the narrative. Very well done!This story could’ve actually taken place anywhere, but the director knows its soul very well. No wonder the production set in the backdrop of Pandharpur looks so authentic. The visual beauty of Elizabeth Ekadashi is such that you may not mind overlooking its shortcomings.

272,370,370,370,370,Elysium,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/elysium-review/,,,,2.466666667,"Neill Blomkamp's Elysium is similar in feel and treatment to District 9, albeit on a grander scale. Despite some obvious problems, particularly the predictable path the film takes, it makes for a fair big screen watch.","It's always nice to have DVD features that provide you with an insight into what it really took to make the film. Luckily, the DVD of Elysium at least does some justice on that front. The DVD has two decent featurettes related to the film. The first one, titled 'Collaboration: Crafting the Performances in Elysium', has the director, Neill Blomkamp, as well as some others, talk about the primary cast of the film - Matt Damon, Jodie Foster and Sharlto Copley. Roughly 13 minutes long, it talks about how they were chosen, what went into their characters and performances. The second, about 12 minutes long, is called 'Engineering Utopia: Creating a Society in the Sky'. It talks about how Elysium, the utopian world located off Earth in the film, was conceptualized and designed. It reminds you of just how tough filmmaking is, particularly when crafting something as visually spectacular as Elysium. Most importantly, both features give us a peek into the mind of Neill Blomkamp. His penchant for talking about current world issues while using a dystopian future as a setting is exciting enough; the fact is that he is an indie filmmaker at heart, and one with a very strong voice at that. The thought he put into the cast and into the design of his film highlights this really well.The DVD has no Indian language options unfortunately, which would have been an added bonus. The film itself makes for a fair home video watch, and is actually the kind of film that seems better on the second watch - a sign that the film truly has layers.No matter how far into the future or how far back in the past a film is set, the core values that drive characters and their motivations remain quite the same. Greed, ambition, delusions of self-importance, love and sacrifice; cinematic portayals of these will always evoke an emotional response. That's what lies at the heart of Neill Blomkamp's latest film, Elysium.Set in the year 2154, the film - like so many others in the recent past - shows a dystopian Earth in shambles because of disease and poverty. The rich, of course, have a solution to this - a plush, artificial satellite world named Elysium; a world that has its own governance and system of control over the less fortunate. Max is one of the lowly citizens of Earth, one who has always dreamed of living on Elysium instead.In terms of look and production, Elysium is a clear notch above Blomkamp's highly acclaimed and quite terrific film District 9 - which was also set in a dystopian future. Also, quite like how District 9 spoke about a serious issue plaguing humanity - social segregation - and the potential threat that increasing dependence on private funding can pose, Elysium too looks at very real problems facing humankind today - class divides and the power that a select few have by virtue of their financial superiority.Seen through the prism of a time that seems so distant to us, the depiction of the disparity and contrast between the haves and the haves-not might seem a little extreme in the film, if you don't pause to look at how it is actually a very serious reflection of society as it stands today. Isn't Antilla, for example, a current day version of Elysium? The question, ""How rich is too rich,"" just has no answer today. In Blomkamp's futuristic, ultra-beautiful, lens-flared universe this question is underlined further. The poor obviously want more, but the rich want even more. Money, power, control; those who have even some of it want all of it.Then again, Elysium also has within it the message that there is still hope; and cinema itself has in it the power to effortlessly instill that hope in us.  There is the ability to love, to feel, and to give anything up for the sake of a loved one. Despite the predictable turns that the film takes, it largely works because of the incredible detailing in Blomkamp's vision of the future, some electric hand combat fight scenes, and because of the key actors in Elysium.There are very few actors like Jodie Foster. She can radiate a warm, feminine presence with as much ease as she can seem cold, cunning, calculative and cruel. In Elysium, she falls into the latter category, and though the character itself is one she can easily sleepwalk through, that doesn't make it any less effective. Matt Damon, who plays Max, once again assumes a physical personality to go with his character, and he is good as always. He has to virtually carry the film on his shoulders, and he pulls it off convincingly. The remainder of the cast, however, is seldom anything more than functional.Elysium, quite like its namesake haven for the rich in the film, is by no means perfect. Despite its breakneck pace, it seems far longer than its runtime of 111 minutes. Its rather linear graph serves its purpose, but doesn't grab you and hook you the way you would have liked, considering the sheer scale of the visuals. Also - and this is a problem that most futuristic sci-fi films face - the depiction and usage of some of the technology strikes more than a few false notes. Even if you account for the liberty that a sci-fi film is invariably allowed to take, there are still logical loopholes in some of the tech, apart from the many times you wonder that if they could manage technology as complex as that, then why couldn't they manage something as simple as this.Despite the niggles, Elysium makes for a fun big screen watch. You might as well watch it today, because you never quite know what tomorrow has in store.

273,371,371,371,371,Ender's Game,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/enders-game-review/,,,,2.466666667,"Asa Butterfield, known to the world so far only as the adorable Hugo from the recent Scorsese masterpiece, anchors a film that also has names like Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley in the cast. A surprisingly engaging sci-fi flick, Gavin Hood’s Ender’s Game isn’t exactly blockbuster VFX extravaganza material, but makes for an intriguing adolescent-coming-of-age story set in the distant future. ","When I first watched the trailer of Ender’s Game, it exhausted me even though it was only a couple of minutes long. The space-sci-fi setting – so overdone in recent times – seemed cumbersome; the VFX looked all-too-familiar; Harrison Ford, a long-time favourite of mine, seemed jaded; and, quite simply, the plot of the film just didn’t seem inspiring. Obviously, then, expectations from the film were close to nil. I’d like to believe, though, that it wasn’t just rock-bottom expectations that led me to be fairly intrigued by the film when I finally watched it.Set 50 years after our planet was invaded by and subsequently reclaimed from an alien species known as the Formics, we learn that the powers-that-be have zeroed in on a very peculiar manner of countering any further attacks – training Earth’s brightest adolescent minds in tactical military strategy.It isn’t completely the fault of this particular film, that it has arrived towards the fag end of the same year that saw films like Oblivion, Gravity, Elysium, After Earth, Pacific Rim, Star Trek Into Darkness and so many more. Despite being based on a book of the same name written all the way back in 1985, Ender’s Game seems to have so many elements – big and small – similar to these films that it does seem a lot like déjà vu; not to mention how it often reminds you of more seminal sci-fi flicks like The Matrix and Star Wars. Still, the film manages to hold its own by the time you reach the end of it, for more reasons than one.Despite its futuristic setting, the problems that young Ender faces hit home. He’s a curious, brilliant child, but a bit of a misfit; he doesn’t do so well under authority, quite prone to bursts of rebellion. Apart from being the usual save-the-world effort, the film, then, is also the coming-of-age story of young Ender. Far more interestingly, the film also very clearly raises questions about the art of war itself. Does war have any place for morality? If you are in a war, then is winning the sole objective of the war? What about the way you win it? Does history remember the victor or does it remember the side that fought with their morals intact?Even with these rather pertinent questions that the film raises, it does so within the periphery of Ender’s story; thus coming across as fairly lightweight and breezy. Not that the pace of the film is brisk, but it keeps you on your toes guessing, while throwing in a twist or two, once in a while; right until the big climactic twist, which pushes the film up a few notches.Asa Butterfield, last seen as the blue-eyed, angelic titular boy in Martin Scorsese’s Hugo, once again plays the titular character in Ender’s Game. His eyes remain piercingly blue, but the difference is that the innocence of childhood has now been replaced by teenage angst and moral dilemma. Unusually lean and scrawny for the lead character in a film of this scale, it is this unassuming physicality which truly makes him stand out as a character. Besides, the boy has an intensity about him that one rarely sees in actors today, and that helps the film tremendously.Harrison Ford as Colonel Graff appears as worn out and jaded through the film as he seemed in the trailer. Also – though this could be just me - every time the film was in the midst of a space battle simulation scene with Ford sitting at a console trying to train the young cadets to fight, I couldn’t help wishing for him to just whizz away on the Millennium Falcon and show them how it’s done. Viola Davis and Sir Ben Kingsley, both in roles that didn’t particularly need actors of their caliber, do well enough anyway.Director Gavin Hood, also credited as screenplay writer, doesn’t ever let proceedings get too heavy or tedious. The plot twists are fun and keep you hooked for the large part. And though the VFX aren’t particularly outstanding, they’re largely unobtrusive, letting the story talk for itself. This helps the film as well. With a runtime of under two hours, then, Ender’s Game is a surprisingly watchable film, and sets itself up nicely as a franchise for the future.

Sridevi brings to us a home-maker's self-doubt with a wonderful performance despite the squeak in her voice and distracting accent.,"The Indian mom gets her due from Hindi cinema. Finally. No this is not the educated, job-and-home juggler, modern 'aaj ki naari' (Today's woman). This is the one whose full-time job is to makes homes, the one who is so humble about her 'small' business on the side that the rest of the world is only willing to dismiss her achievements.   The woman who has never found expression for her confidence, until one day a slight window of opportunity opens up. English Vinglish takes this opportunity and ever-so gradually talks to us, her family, about our responsibility to empower her. While doing so it keeps the atmosphere light and lets you spend 5 weeks with Shashi (Sridevi) and her gorgeous homeliness.  Yes, I saw my mom, my nani (grandmom), my aunt, my cousin and countless other enterprising women in Shashi - warm, modest, coy, technically uneducated but sharp women. She is underexposed to the world outside and yet has a mind so broad, and an attitude so simple and clear that it would make some of the urban seen-the-world, know-it-all snots ashamed of their chauvinism. She is put down by those closest to her and that affects her more than the deep love and support that others might offer. Her pride is hurt and you see her swallow her hurt and even take blame to keep harmony. She beats herself up, for not having stuck to her ""should haves"", before anyone else could get a chance.  And yet given a chance, this meek, submissive lady can fly high if she somehow manages to find freedom.If guys out there think this a women's film because it sounds all touchy-mushy. You might want to watch it so you can empower the women in your life and see your world from their eyes.Sridevi brings out complexities within the life of a simple Indian woman with grace and elegance. Even if it were for a total of just 30 seconds, her dance is much more graceful than many of today's top actresses put together. Sure, her squeaky voice is distracting enough to make you wonder if Urmila Matondkar has dubbed for her in a not-so Marathi lilt in her Hindi. The constant stutter/hesitation and lack of confidence her character demands can seem a little repetitive. But her gorgeous eyes make up for that. And I just don't mean their shape or the way they are made up, but what they convey, the emotions they stir within. I don't know whether to thank her or be disappointed that she has made the typical housewife, larger than life.I doubt she could achieve any of this if she weren't provided with material to play with. Quite a few parts of this simple story manage to convey a lot about the relationships and their dynamics even though only a few minutes are spent on them in terms of time. I especially enjoyed Shashi's relationship with her son and the character of her spirited mother-in-law. On the other hand, the gay effeminate character is caricaturish and the charming, romantic French man is too good to be true. But, if that's what it takes to balance it off with a positive attitude towards sexual orientation and subtle, cross-border love, so be it. The other characters like say her husband and daughter were the stereotypical male chauvinist and ruthless teenager. However, we do have to realize that these stereotypes do find their place in every other household with some or the other variation. And some of them don't necessarily have an instant change of outlook within 5 minutes. I loved the pace at which English Vinglish goes about it's business. No rush, no great strides to cover lots of ground. In fact, at half-time, all you've seen is whatever you know from the trailers in terms of plot. Shashi Godbole is being put down for not knowing English. And you wonder how they are going to close all the threads in just over an hour. Yet, you haven't gotten bored. Even in it's entirety the plot has just the slightest curve in its arc. I'd have liked it better if I didn't know some of the punch lines from the trailers or they had a few more of them. Also, another slight sore point is that it does tend to get a little preachy, even as it gets masked under conversations and real-life speech situations. I also wonder how it'd have been to see Shashi do what she does while living in India, without using the American 'support' system as an anchor.With that we come to the question of the importance given to the English language in English Vinglish. On the one hand, I could get distracted by the supposed moral of the story, and the overt emphasis on the language. Because, surely an Indian home-maker in Pune, can get by without HAVING to know English and she won't lose much face either. The exaggeration is made to make a point. But Shashi's need to learn English is my mom's want to learn driving is my grandmom's drive to learn how to play the harmonium at age 75! It's not about the English or the car or the musical instrument. It's about confidence, it's about independence, it's because they didn't get to do it then, it's about being proud of yourself and finding self-worth, it's about feeling good about yourself. And for the rest of us, it's about giving them space to do so.

Hardcore animation fans could consider watching it for the animation alone. The rest would be better off catching something like Ice Age on DVD.","With some of the most stunning visuals and gorgeously executed animation you’ll see, you’d think that the makers of Epic would perhaps invest a tad bit more in the writing to ensure that the film becomes a memorable experience for the viewer. Sadly enough, that isn’t the case. So, while you’re always enjoying the animation part of the film, you’re also always conscious of how the film isn’t nearly exciting enough to be truly hooked by.Yet another film based on a book, this time on one titled ‘The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs’ by William Joyce, the film is a mixture of a coming-of-age tale, an underdog story, a fantasy adventure and even a tiny little teen romance. It recounts the adventures of Mary Katherine or MK, a teenage girl whose new life in the woods with her formerly estranged father takes a turn for the fantastic when she crosses paths with a group of miniscule warriors called the Leaf Men, who are locked in perpetual war with bug-creatures known as the Boggans.It becomes quite hard to be truly taken in by a film which you can predict almost every step of the way. MK’s initial apprehensions of moving in with her father, how she encounters the Leaf Men, the path that the story then follows, almost all of it is something that even the least involved of audiences will be able to predict with ease. In fact, if the film wasn’t embellished with the kind of top-notch animation that it is, it would have been downright boring. Even the humour in the film, something that is usually strong in most animations films, is largely insipid and uninspiring.The film, like a lot of other animation films, does have a message within as well. It talks about the universal conflict between ‘them’ and ‘us’, the divisions that cause a planet that deserves peace, to be in a constant state of flux. It also attempts to play on the age-old emotions of a young man or woman coming of age, rising to the challenge and eventually coming up trumps. Thus, because the film is at heart a clean, honest attempt at a fantasy adventure, it becomes very hard to dismiss it for the many flaws it has. The film also has an ensemble cast of voices for the characters, though I must confess that one big name in the cast quite disappointed me firstly in choice, and secondly in execution. Amanda Seyfried, who voices MK, does a fairly good job as the girl caught up in a war which she has to fight for her own good, even though it isn’t hers to fight at all. She manages to evoke the right mix of hesitation and confidence through her journey in the film. Colin Farrell as Ronin, the leader of the Leaf Men is excellent as well. It took me a while to wrap my head around the idea that the mature and calming voice I was hearing was that of Farrell. The big disappointment for me was Christoph Waltz as Mandrake, the leader of the Boggans. Waltz’s voice and accent just didn’t suit the character in the first place. Yet, I expected him to lift it up by his sheer presence, which unfortunately just doesn’t happen. None of the other voices are particularly memorable, save perhaps for Jason Sudeikis, who voices MK’s father.From Blue Sky, the studio behind the Ice Age films and Rio, and directed by Chris Wedge, the man who directed the first Ice Age film, the animation is the one thing that makes Epic watchable despite the poor writing and mostly just-functional voice casting. The forest environment, the atmosphere created by the lighting, the execution of the action scenes, absolutely everything technical about the film is superb. Even the early part of the end credits is set in a beautiful little animation sequence that makes you stay till the end. However, the fact that they had all that effort put into the animation and so little into developing a funny and heartwarming story at the core of it broke my heart more than once. It isn’t easy to tell someone that Epic is a film that can easily be missed; but that, unfortunately, is the sad truth of it.

A calculated, dark film with Denzel Washington playing the kind of character he's almost come to be synonymous with, the film often gives you a sense of deja vu - but not always in a good way. The Equalizer is a rather strange film, to be honest. A dark thriller can either be racy, or it can be measured. Fuqua chooses the latter path, and takes it to the extreme. No surprises, no heart-in-your-mouth moments, no twists to grab at you - nothing. Denzel Washington plays Robert McCall - a regular man with a seemingly regular life, which he makes an attempt at living like clockwork. But he has a past, McCall - and it comes to the fore when the situation calls for it.Everything in the film is understated - the humour, the gloss, the grunge - all of it. Washington's McCall is a cool customer at all times; yet he knows how to wield not just regular weapons, but ordinary household object as weapons as well. The reason for it, McCall's back story is only hinted at. We never get to know why he went from some sort of special-ops or military to living a staid, lonely life. Presumably, he's done stuff he's either ashamed of or regretful for.And then, we never quite know why McCall turns it around again, as the events of the film unfold. Perhaps it's him feeling sorry for a character who, from his perspective, is having it rough. Or it is just a case of a leopard not being able to change its spots. Either way, McCall takes it on himself to fight injustice and evil when he sees it, in a manner that he deems fit.Denzel Washington, and indeed Robert McCall, are ice cool in more ways than one. A Sherlock-esque ability to read situations; a pleasant, fatherly demeanour; deadly fighting skills - he's a perfect movie character, in a manner that confuses even other characters in the film. It is in this aspect, of straddling a realistic and edgy treatment style with out-and-out 'movie' characters, where The Equalizer stumbles often.Everything seems to be carefully planned out. When one deliberately chooses a realistic tone to treat the film, the tone lends itself to a feeling of unpredictability, of not knowing what might happen next. But with The Equalizer, that never happens, because with characters like these, you know exactly what's going to happen. It doesn't help that Fuqua further inserts 'cool' cinema techniques like the slow motion and rapid cuts once in a while.The film thus ends up becoming most fascinating only on paper, particularly with its title. It's an unequal world; a world of haves and haves-not; a world where someone is always one-up on someone else. In such a world, you need someone to bring that balance, to even things out a bit. To equalize.Trapped in his own image, Denzel Washington still manages to rise above that and seem like the guy you'd want on your side when the odds are stacked against you. But in walking the tightrope between the real and the reel, you end up confused about whether the directionless journey of this character really amounts to much.With all of this and the slow pace of the film, you often begin to think of the point of it all. The shot-taking begins to seem redundant, all of it seems like a soulless exercise, and it leaves you feeling distant and uninvolved. Bad guys who're good and good guys who're bad - both kinds make for fascinating movie characters if they manage to touch your heart. The Equalizer makes sense for the most, but it just doesn't touch the heart.

277,375,375,375,375,Eternal Sunshine Of A Spotless Mind,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review2 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/eternal-sunshine-spotless-mind-review/,,4/5.0,,4.566666667,"Disclaimer: You’re going to get confused, starry and you’ll be yanking your hair to understand exactly what is going on in Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Director Michel Gondry and Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman come up with a surreal story that depicts the love story of a couple that define the phrase 'opposites attract'. It’s a roller coaster ride; only your eyes are wide open and you’re constantly trying to come to conclusions about the position of the film. It’s a story about two people who fall in love, break their hearts and just don’t know what to do with the memories.","There are only so many ways to portray fate-defying love in a film. There’s tough love, where the pair fights against all odds. There’s the cheesy way, where you’re made to believe the couple were always meant to be together and there’s Michel Gondry’s Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. The latter is a story about a man and a woman, but it is interspersed with memories in such a manner, it forms a mashed, tangy concoction that tastes of our favorite cliché: Love conquers all.The Academy award-winning screenplay written by Charlie Kaufman is one of a kind. Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) randomly meet on the train and hit it off. They’re an unlikely pair; Joel is passive, meek and yet bursting with intense thoughts. Clementine is fresh, impulsive and like a sweet smelling lightening bolt. The film goes back and forth in time to reveal to the viewers that these two have been together before their chance meeting. A scientific procedure they both undergo, allows them to erase certain memories. You’re running around with them, trying to remember why they were in love, what they forgot and remember, who erased who first- but you’re not running in along a straight line or even once-around a circle. It’s an insane loop, going round and round, leaving a little jolt at every breather. It’s a thrilling experience – but one that can be experienced only by living it through. The core of the film lays in the questions it leaves you with- Do memories define our existence? Are forgotten memories an easy route to blissful ignorance? Are we really better off erasing memories that cause pain? The editing and cinematography are crisp, achieving the purpose of an anticipated confusion. Background score consists of an inspiring mix of songs, all pointing to the themes of the film. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are fascinating in the film. They play all parts with utmost conviction, be it the conflicted past, the warped memories they are transported into or the ignorant present. As a viewer you are constantly wondering how such opposites could be crushed into the power of love, so much so that they get two chances to walk their journey.The Focus edition of the DVD has some bonus features including an audio commentary with Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman, where they discuss the concept, the production hassles and deleted scenes. It also has a 7 min making of clip, which is more like a trailer, but the prize of the DVD is a 12 min witty conversation between Michel Gondry and Jim Carrey where they both talk about the relationship between an actor and a director and how Carrey interpreted the story of the film. Watching Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is similar to having someone make you rapidly walk forward, then backwards and then forward again with a kaleidoscope, for an hour and a half. Your head becomes woozy, you might not understand or be able to conclude but you’ll realize that love happens in many ways. You can’t really re-attach broken pieces of a vintage vase and pretend that it never broke, but you won’t be able throw it away either. It’ll lie somewhere in the corner of your house, and you’re going to run into it at some point- much like the memories Joel and Clementine share of one another. Can a spotless mind ever stay eternally bright?

278,376,376,376,376,[The] Expendables 3,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/expendables-3-review/,,,,4.566666667,"A bunch of has-beens kick some serious backside in The Expendables 3, and they make a lot of noise while doing so. You have to be a serious action star fan with a lot of time and really strong eardrums to enjoy this one.","You'd think that somebody would suggest to the guys writing the cheques that sequels to uninspiring, sagging franchises won't quite cut it in the risky business that filmmaking is. Clearly though, nobody has done that yet.A whole battalion of former stars, with some former stars as additions, are back to provide loud bangs, done-to-death action sequences and the occasional smile-worthy lines in a film that the world could have done just as easily without. The Expendables 3 is a film which does have at least a couple of moments that make you not dismiss it as a complete waste of time, but only just.Expectedly, this one too begins with one rather far-fetched action scene, then proceeds to a few more, then finally ends with a long drawn action sequence. The question of what the plot of the film is, then, is moot.It's cute, honestly, how the film attempts to tackle themes like loyalty and love amongst brothers-in-arms; the awkward relationship that men share, when they can't be openly expressive about their genuine love and respect for each other, but how they will put their life on the line when the time calls for it. Too bad that the cynical times we live in means that for a substantial majority of the audience, these ideas belong in cold storage - quite like the men that make up the cast.Even though the all-action-star lineup is well past its sell-by date, they do still have that slight lingering air of glittering machismo that once made the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Wesley Snipes, Jason Statham and Harrison Ford into global superstars. Most of them look awkward on screen now, save for Jason Statham, who is also the only one of the lot who could actually ever act. The most welcome addition to the cast is Mel Gibson, who plays the baddie with unabashed glee; and he also gets the best line in the film.Stallone, who has also been credited with the story and co-credited with screenplay, gets the meatiest role, though I use that term relatively. It is hard to see why anyone must actually be credited with the story here, because it is so merely functional that a couple of jagged cuts with whole lines of dialogue cut out - presumably the censor board's orders - seem to make no difference at all.If there is one reason why it is a tad bit easier to be kinder to an Expendables film, than to, say, Kick or Jai Ho, it is the technical wizardry at their disposal. All of the most far-fetched action scenes merge live-action and CG beautifully, making it easier to suspend one's disbelief. Real-looking ludicrousness is, after all, quite easier to buy than tacky-looking ludicrousness.Hopefully, at least the plight of this film will make the makers see sense and not subject us to a part four. Even if it does, I doubt a review of that film will read any differently than this one.

In which they show us a way to make the world perfect. So what if that route itself is as imperfect as the system it's trying to correct? So, while it is lively and fun, FALTU isn't something that'll stay with you after you've walked out of the theaters. Though I think it wanted you to, what with the strong message it tries to convey masked under all that light-heartedness. Oh yeah, and that one brilliant dance performance in the climax.","It is striking how FALTU makes you aware of our climb up the Maslow's need pyramid. Gone are the days of worrying about roti, kapda aur makaan. We are now looking at a generation who wants to be trained entertainers. And that is what makes FALTU contemporary. Alas! The methodology used is not convincing and thus along with the few jokes you can only laugh at the writers' naiveté. It will soon be fashionable to make a film about our thoroughly flawed educational system. And isn't it a good thing that we don't expect profound and workable solutions from our films? FALTU doesn't either. But, I do like the basic concept and the way director, Remo has tried to execute it. If only it was a little funnier than it eventually is, with lines, with performances.There were certainly a couple of hilarious, laugh-out-loud scenes. And there are other times that you might not be able to control your smile at the silliness of the situation. But, when a movie sets out to talk about social issues, it needs to leave a lasting impression by whatever means possible. Humor works at most times, but in this one, it doesn't. Especially, if you give away 2-3 of your main punch jokes in the trailer.One reason of course, is that not all the supposedly funny lines make you laugh, though the intention is clear. As a side, you also get a few lectures on the ""right way"" to encourage your kids if they aren't academically bright. Also, though the writing tries hard to make characters behave differently from each other, they do end up without any outstandingly distinguishing factors. The other reason glaring in your face is the inadequate and loudish performances. If only FALTU had a little less of an Uday-Chopra look alike. I mean it is ok if one looks like the other, but why do both of them have to have that silly grin on their face. It just doesn't allow me to go beyond that and look at what might be acting. Sure Puja Gupta is the only saving grace in this department. Yeah, this despite having both Riteish Deshmukh and Arshad Warsi - two of the best we have in terms of comic timing. Again, I'd put the blame on the superfluous writing. There is just no attention paid to their characters.Despite all of this though, the basic plot tries its best to remain true to its theme and the spirit of the film. The bunch of controlling parents is no new concept to the way many of us might have grown up. To see it on screen gives us a sense of camaraderie even. You can hear an entire generation shouting ""LET GO!"" when a son says that to a father. AND there's that last dance in the climax (no, not the closing credits, the one that is a part of the actual film). I could watch it over and over again and bumped up the rating a bit just for that one last masterpiece.

You’ll ask yourself this question again and again throughout this movie about the cover-ups in US-Iraq war. If you are a conspiracy theory fanatic (like me) you’d want to believe everything this film has to offer. Its a slow paced drama but is intense in the magnitude of the story. You’d be served with a fiction film based on true facts, in a completely believable setting. Hey, for all we know, it may not be fiction at all (just sayin’). The lead actors in the film are brilliant. Direction by Doug Liman is gripping. Fiction or not, its a movie worth a watch on DVD.","Fair Game is inspired by the true events in the life of Valerie Plame. Though, how much of the movie is fact or fiction, is open for discussion, it gives the story a lot of juice. With Wiki-Leaks exposing many a cover-ups of the government agencies, the timing of Fair Game has been perfect. It exposes the controversial actions taken by the US government during the US-Iraq war.I’ve been a big fan of Frederick Forsyth’s novels. He takes an incident or a political scandal and weaves a perfectly believable and entertaining piece of fiction around it. Though his novels have much more action and are quite fast paced as compared to this movie, Fair Game possesses the same blueprints of an entertainer.Doug Liman has provided us with some very entertaining spy-action films like the Bourne series and Mr. & Mrs. Smith. But though the tag line of Fair Game reads - ‘Wife. Mother. Spy’, it is not an action film. If not more, they’ve given equal footage to her being a wife and mother, as they have given to her being a spy. You wont miss the action much though, as the intense drama keeps you hooked. Jez Butterworth (screenplay) has done his homework in translating the story of Valerie Plame (Naomi Watts) into an engaging script. Doug Liman’s direction manages to keep you engaged, despite the sluggish pace of the story. The slow pace is required to give the lead actors (Naomi Watts and Sean Penn)  a touch of reality. Their characters grow, coping up to the drastic changes in their lives, and it is shown efficiently owing to their brilliant performances. These two have carried on where they left off in 21 Grams.If you’re into politics, especially the US-Iraq war, you’d love this movie. And even if you’re not, you can watch this one as pure fiction and love it for the powerful performances by Naomi Watts and Sean Penn. Catch on DVD for sure.

Take that! And some more!” an emphatic announcement by Shah Rukh Khan in a not-bad thriller. ,"Are there any limits to obsession? You might mull over that, but the obsessed knows no boundaries and is okay with you 'not getting' it. In fact, that you don't get it, makes him an even greater 'obsessed' even if only in his eyes. Oh what am I going on about! I can talk about a Shah Rukh Khan film without mentioning him for only so long! However, this time the reasons are all good. This is one astounding performance, even if he is playing himself for a good part of the film. Let that register - Shah Rukh Khan plays himself, and yet, it doesn't get to you, doesn't annoy you. In fact, you empathize with the character despite his smugness.Him as Gaurav Chandna though is a different level of act. From frame one you forget the actor and are intrigued-amused by the character. Of course, the prosthetics are amazing. But you are forced to admire the character who quickly morphs into his idol. And you smile at how the actor 'gotchya' because well, he is only playing himself!I wouldn't be surprised if many of his self-proclaimed die-hard fans actually believed that they were getting a sneak peak into the real Shah Rukh Khan's life, especially in the first half of this film. The cooing by the two young ladies sitting by both my sides is certainly testimony enough for me. But hey, even if I wasn't cooing, I was in complete awe all through the first half too.The story is sort-of predictable once you get a hang of the characters but the execution isn't what you'd expect. There is no lead lady, no romantic track and there are no song sequences. No romance and no songs in a Yash Raj-SRK union. And it is not certainly for want of situation - the characters are performing in award shows and weddings, for goodness sake. I don't mind songs in my films, but there is a time and place for that, which most mainstream cinema seems to forget. It is a bold commercial move to not serve the hardcore Bollywood fan their staple. In fact, there is a moment of contemplation. A pause for thought and consideration. The focus is on the two characters and the face off. Which as admirable as it is, gets a tad repetitive after a bit. The second half slacks with one chase sequence too many and there isn't much happening otherwise. That's not to take away anything from the first chase sequence. Camera gimmickry aside, the action choreography and conceptualisation of that chase sequence is worth a portion of the ticket price. So is some camera-framing in a scene or two. But then, post-interval the film gives way to run-of-the-mill roof-top and middle-of-busy-street chase sequences. Except for one scene with a lashing comment in a press conference, it is more of the same. Also, the things Gaurav does are rather predictable and thus not jolting enough. But then again, that is a comment on how fickle star image is. Media, fans, haters alike don't stop a second and consider, “Could this celebrity have behaved this way?”Then we have the borderline sermonisation. It actually reminded me of Shah Rukh Khan's publicity appearance in the pre-match (IPL) show. He was introduced to who the show producers thought was his biggest fan. He gets a 100kg cake every year on Shah Rukh's birthday and books the whole theater to take his friends and family for every Shah Rukh film. And yet, Shah Rukh Khan the actor seemed a little awkward. Maybe it was all an act or maybe it was genuine worry of meeting a real-life Gaurav Chandna.Even if we think he is a little out there, does the fan in us identify a little with him? Of course, Gaurav Chandna clearly needs help. And thankfully not every fan is like that. We might not be an Aryan Khanna fan or even a Shah Rukh Khan fan, but we admire someone. We want to meet that someone. We won't go to 'any' extent to meet them, but what extent would we go to? Do the people who would go further than most others see a part of themselves in Gaurav Chandna? Do they say, “you won't 'get' it” to people who point that out to them? Do they get an insight into how crazy it is? For bringing these thoughts, maybe for not making me want to tear my hair out, for giving me 2+ hours of a solid performance, without taking anything away from the decent film that Fan is, even if I won't want to watch it again, I, a Shah-Rukh-non-fan would like to see more of this Shah Rukh. Maybe in a film that that will take our mind of his performance.

Layered, nuanced and cleverly hidden away in a charming village setting is a scathing take on our tendency to divide ourselves into 'us' and 'them'. It is also a film about dreams, and about how everyone has a right to have them. ","In a tiny, innocuous scene in Fandry, almost in the background, a school teacher begins explaining to his students the subtext in a poem by a Marathi saint. The poem's title, roughly translated, means, ""All is not what it seems."" Apart from the tale of innocent love and the wry look at caste divides in rural India that Fandry is, it is also a gentle reminder of how nothing that we see or hear can be taken at face value; because nothing, really, is what it seems.Everyone in Fandry is chasing something. The dark-skinned son of the lone 'untouchable' family in the village - the family given the filthiest of odd jobs to do - yearns to look fairer and better. He pines for his classmate, the daughter of an upper class family. The ones in the village who are better off dream of Mumbai. And those in Mumbai? Yearning for a quiet life in the village perhaps? The cycle is endless. Director Nagraj Manjule sometimes chooses subtle symbolism and puts it blatantly in front of you at other times, as he exposes how frail our social structure really is. He does it while never taking himself or the film too seriously. Fandry, incidentally, means 'pig'; one of the many symbols used in the film. Fandry could as well be termed a period film; except that the 'period' shown in the film is today. Here and now. We know, because of references to the IPL and Facebook. But the manner in which man believes in the concept of superior and inferior, and how the ones considered inferior are looked down upon with vile disgust has held true since the dawn of humankind itself, and will likely continue far into the future. If you think about it, it seems hard to fathom just how man came up with the concept of caste. But millennia of conditioning have come to mean that the 'lowest' in the social strata have come to actually believe that they belong at the bottom of the ladder. So, a father lashes out at his son who dares to dream, and who refuses to conform to what society expects him to be - the village 'untouchable'.Fandry is, thus, heartbreaking. A boy old enough to not be termed 'innocent', but young enough to dream of a better life with honest sincerity isn't allowed to do so. You root for him, you want him to be allowed to dream, even if you can almost see that his dreams very well don't stand a chance of fulfilment. Because, you see, he represents all of us. We're all prisoners of what is expected of us; Jabya, the protagonist, symbolizes each and every one of us.Fandry is scathing and witty in equal measure. Shot without frills and technical show-boating, it concentrates on what each frame, each event stands for. The characters are real, and real means gray. Whether it is enforced or whether it is out of free will; each character is made to conform. So, in one of the film's best moments, the whole village comes to a standstill - because they're 'expected to'. The what and why of it, I'll leave for you to discover.The raw, rural Marathi dialect is tricky, so it helps that the film is subtitled in English. It also means that the film can reach a wider audience, particularly because it is one of the rare Marathi films to get a release outside Maharashtra as well. Fandry is a brutally honest film, one that makes you smile and brood equally. The production design and the cast play a large role in creating that world for you.Somnath Awghade, who plays Jabya, plays him earnestly, with full conviction. He, as well as the boy who plays his friend, are so natural, it astounds you. Kishore Kadam, who tends to be the same in every film, is perfect here as Jabya's father. He makes you feel for him almost always. Writer-director Nagraj Manjule, who also makes a charming little cameo as the village oddball, tells us a story with universal appeal, but in a manner that roots it to what he clearly knows best. At a crisp 103 minutes, the film is paced beautifully, and it has a simple guitar piece that is like the soul of the film. Everytime it plays, it seems like a dream - it reminds you that for all us, there's always something that's out of reach.Fandry, then, is as much our story as it is Jabya's. True, we may not live in the village like him, and our dreams may not be the same as his. But then, as Manjule keeps reminding us, maybe they actually are; because nothing is what it seems.

283,381,381,381,381,Fantastic Mr Fox,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review,/movie/fantastic-mr-fox-review/,,,,4.166666667,"After entering animated worlds of fishes, monsters, ants, bugs and toys, here’s a charming stop motion feature film about foxes. Agreed they’re not exactly attractive creatures, but with voices of George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray and Michael Gambon, this amusing tale is irresistible. At the awards, it was completely overshadowed by Up in 2009, but now that it’s available on DVD, you should certainly consider renting it for an entertaining evening with your family.","There are some years when certain gems remain hidden or underexposed because a far bigger gem steals the show completely. The year 2009 saw Disney Pixar’s Up do that to most other animation films, as it won all major awards. Fantastic Mr Fox was a victim. Since it did not receive a deserving theatrical release in India - distributors are very wary of stop-motion films, it appears -  it can finally seek some redemption since it is available on DVD.For those of you who’ve become habitual viewers of every single Pixar and Dreamworks product, Fantastic Mr Fox is a refreshing experience for a multitude of reasons. One, this animation film has been shot completely in stop motion. It gives the film a very hand-made, indie feel.Two, it features voices that you never thought could be voices for foxes. Drumroll please George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Michael Gambon (of Dumbledore fame from Harry Potter), Owen Wilson, Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzmann.Clooney, the voice of Mr Fox is the film’s biggest plus - just listening to his voice elevates the film to a new level - he’s full of attitude, chutzpah and class that’s rare with voices that are trying too hard to emote in an animation film. It’s like watching an Ocean’s Eleven in animation, what with Mr Fox, a family man, newspaper columnist, keen to go back to his hunting ways as he plots the most famous chicken heist of all time. His wife, Mrs Fox (Streep) however doesn’t approve of this and the entire community of beavers, rabbits and other pests gets into trouble.There’s a reason why it’s call Mister Fox and Clooney’s the man giving him a voice. The actor clearly represents the epitome of masculinity and the story essentially is about how men, once married have to hold the reins on their wild, hunting ways that they so enjoyed in their days of bachelorhood. So while chasing chickens and stealing them was fine once upon a time, the responsibility of being a family man must bring some control on such vicarious pleasures after having a son and a stable family life to support.While it puts forward this argument, it also provides Mr Fox to speak his mind - men do want to be fantastic, awesome and simply the best, despite the boundaries that family life brings. Thankfully, the screenplay balances both sides of the argument well and celebrates every family member’s uniqueness. Even the little ones have their own qualities to bring forth in an hour of crisis. Ash (Schwartzmann) who is Fox’s son, for example is always keen to be productive and useful - he even wants to be with his father during the heist - but is not allowed to. He gets his chance to prove himself though.The humour in the film is somewhat the cool types - it does not make you laugh out loud - but it does have a certain charm that is amusing to kids and adults alike. If you’ve seen director Wes Anderson’s earlier film, The Darjeeling Limited, you’ll know what I’m talking about.You don’t quite begin to appreciate the film until you witness the meticulous amount of detailing that’s gone into converting this Roald Dahl story into a stop motion film. Which is where the extras on the DVD come as a big bonus. The film if you look at the bigger picture, is essentially a  flip book format of over 60,000 still photographs shot using a Nikon camera, which gives it a very HD feel. The textures, colours and setting of the village is very similar to where Dahl lived himself and the actors recorded their voices in a real farm-house in the countryside and not in a studio, as is usually the case. So many miniatures, so much effort - the efforts seem mind boggling.The stop motion is far better than Mel Gibson’s Chicken Run and although you might find it uncomfortable at the beginning, by the time Clooney’s voice plays tricks with your senses, you’ll forget what’s stop motion and what’s 3D animation.Fantastic Mr Fox is recommended viewing with family, kids and friends. Try it on a weekend.

It certifies what we can make out from the tabloids. The beauty is that it doesn't even make an attempt to shock. It certainly is a well-told story about the rise and fall of an ambitious woman. And what she learns on the way. The rise might seem fairy-tale like but it is only a set-up for the meat of the story that comes in the last 45 minutes. These 45 minutes take the drama to a high point. Unfortunately these 45 minutes come a little too late. Yes, the post-interval pace and run-time too close to 3 hours are big-time dampeners.So, welcome to the fashion world where women dazzle and men are either gay or sleazeballs or at times both. But none of this is used to sensationalize. It's all stated in a very matter-of-fact, part-of-life manner. In fact, the page-3, prop-dolls are shown as human beings - intelligent, conscious, ambitious, and most important of all, gray human beings. They celebrate success and are supportive in failure. They too have friends who can be called upon in the middle of the night in dire times. Fashionis sprinkled with interesting, thoughtfully written characters with good dialogues. Sure, the weirder stereotypes are chosen. But some of them are so atypical of the actors performing them, that they stand out. To start with there's Meghana (Priyanka Chopra), the aspiring supermodel going through a slow and steady moral breakdown. We've seen Priyanka in quite some high profile movies recently, but this is the first one to actually use her talent and warm facial features. Anisha (Kitu Gidwani) runs a top-line modeling agency that has the knack of taking supermodels through their career cycle, from attitude to arrogance. Kitu plays the perfect shade of gray as the cold yet knowing, beautiful godmother of all successful models.  Harsh Chayya as the arrogant designer, Vinay, who has a strong, almost comical lisp, shows he can actually act if made to. Same goes for Ashwin Mushran, who plays a struggling designer, Rohit and Meghana's compassionate guide in the big bad world of fashion.The only actor who doesn't step out of her comfort zone is Kangna Ranaut, who plays the currently reigning supermodel, Shonali, to perfection. The character is tailor-made for Kangna. She by now has mastered the confused, suicidal woman. So, I still haven't figured out whether her slurred mispronunciations are because of the doped-out characters she plays or it's just her. People wanting to watch the movie for the beautifully stylized women won't be disappointed. The costumes are as drop-dead gorgeous as the women wearing them - both in and out of the fashion shows. Especially noticeable are the colors chosen for Priyanka to match her mood. The make-up from when the women are at home, to the fashion shows, to when they are in despair is absolutely stunning.You are in for a treat if you want some good-looking people perform well. Don't forget that extra ounce of patience to pull you through a few parts of the movie.

285,383,383,383,383,Fast and Furious,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review,/movie/fast-and-furious-review/,,,,3.55,Lean Burn machines with gleaming bodywork coupled with some wanna be bad boys; this film fails to ignite the turbo charge.,"This is a summer block buster; one of the many that Hollywood keeps dishing out in the fond hope that at least some if not one would set the cash registers ringing loudly. Having never seen any of the earlier films in the series, I looked forward to some hot road action and fisticuffs, but was tremendously disappointed.  This film is downright lame; as a summer action block buster it has the required hot gals, automotive action, and studly heroes, but all of it combines in such a limp fashion, that it becomes a drag. Of course, there are set piece action sequences; all but one have cars moving at hyper kinetic speeds. The film opens with one such set piece, which introduces the “cool” characters in the story. This sequence is very predictable and obvious in its outcome, and the CGI effects add nothing to it. When the film cuts from the CGI frame to the “real” one, the perspective changes in a very obvious manner, and the viewer immediately sees that “real” is much too slow. This kills whatever impact the sequence might have had. Action sequences are very hard to visualize and stage; they have to be created in such a manner that they look good on screen which is what really counts. This director badly needs some lessons, possibly he should take a tip or two from John Frankenheimer; take a look at that superbly executed car chase on narrow roads that Frankenheimer gave us in Ronin. The other car chase sequences are set in tunnels and there is one on the city roads too. The tunnel sequences also suffer from the CGI syndrome. Yes, there is a lot of fast editing, rapid cuts to revving speedometers, and loud sounds, but it just gives you a big, bad, headache. The best sequence of the lot is the illegal race held on the city streets, simply because the CGI seems to have been kept to a minimum, and one gets a feel of the speed and the last minute near misses. There is wonder of wonders, a chase on foot too, but it is done in a very half hearted manner.The director probably believed that he needed to keep things moving to engage the audience and not let them worry about the plot; so he keeps the story moving, keeps the camera moving, and keeps the cars moving too. This formula does not work when it comes to the “emotional / bonding” scenes between the characters. These scenes become so ponderous; thanks to the clichéd dialogue and wooden acting, that they just sink like lead weights.Vin Diesel has as much acting ability as his pectorals, in fact they seem to speak for him most of the time. The rest of the cast is a motley mish mash of toned bodies wearing snazzy clothes, and as they have nothing much to do, they really do not matter. The villain of the piece looks like one of those stereotypical drug dealers that infest the streets of Los Angeles ( at least in Hollywood movies), all chains, rings, and flash. The bad boys really try hard to look bad, with buffed up bodies, tattoos, and obligatory snarls. The eye candy does not stay around long for one to have a really good lecherous look. The whole movie looks and feels like it has been recycled from shows on TV; MTV Grind and other police serials immediately come to mind. The FBI Agents, the villains, the heroes, are all so obviously copies of copies, that one experiences a sensation equivalent to that of eating pureed cardboard, while watching the film. 
Watch this film if you feel like a pubescent lad or are one, the rest need to find better things to do on a hot summer day.

Car shots and straight gun shotsfeel good while you watch them, but they do not take the movie up to the mark.","Driver (The Rock) is out to avenge his brother’s murder while a Killer and a Cop are chasing him. With a regular pace, this one is a stereotypical revenge movie. 
The narrative is linear and the director hasn’t even attempted to induce depth or leave it to the viewer to derive any meaning out of the movie. The story spells out notable  points,, some of which irritated me because I could predict where they were going to take me. The script is something you or I could have come up with. The movie doesn't do justice either to its name or to its genre. Not a single scene could be called ‘Faster’, and there is hardly any real action in the entire movie. Lot of killings - yes, but all of them were as simple as crushing ants (and no wrestling at all?!!). The lesser than expected number of gun fights made it a flat action film. The plot isn’t convincing enough to be a great thriller, definitely not for an audience who is used to the likes of The Departed. I could have done with more of ""Killer"", because it'd be great to see the reason for the character's existence! Though Rock looks great with all the muscle, his acting and expressionless face make me wish wrestlers didn’t change professions. Even a finer tuned character would have made me feel better. The director reserved few dialogues for Rock, and terse at that, but then that is a two-sided coin. At least they didn’t make it worse by forcing too many too-good-for-him lines on him. There is more character to the Cop than the lead, but Billy Bob Thornton is a fine actor who is wastedhere. Oliver Jackson-Cohen plays Killer (and looks killer!), but he is a kid who has much to learn. This is a case that proves that non-Bollywood directors also shove in scantily clad hot-looking women with no significant roles to attract audiences. A lot of the movie seems like a waste of the makers’ energy, like the emotional scenes that they tried to heave in more than once for random unnecessary push in stories. Although on the better side, the movie is not just about mindless killing. It does have some story, and a climax that could partly surprise you. Watch if you have nothing better to do.

Worry not, it's not preachy but it ain't entertaining either. ","""Do appearances matter?"" Should they? This is the question Rajat Kapoor and Co try to answer with Fatso! Only that it would look too plain as is, and thus is masked with an interesting philosophical ""what if?"" What if you died by mistake? And the death-givers wanted to rectify their error in a controversial manner. It sound funny, but unfortunately Fatso isn't funny and neither does it take the philosophical inferences too seriously. So, it's neither entertaining nor engaging. It just stays something that could be.Yet, the performances work big time for Fatso. Be it Ranvir Shorey in the title role or the always affable Gul Panag or the charming Purab Kohli. They are the ones that make you sit through. They and the hope that it will all end with a smile on your face. Instead mid-way a fear starts creeping in that a film that banks on the emotional ties in the relationships is going to end up like any other romantic film - one in which people fall in love for the sake of convenience rather than growing into it organically. There are quite a few issues touched upon, but none of them are delved into more than superficially. From insensitivity of people to an obese person to a friend falling in love with his friend's girlfriend while having a girlfriend of his own - are all cursorily touched upon but not taken too seriously - almost as if the writer/director was scared of making his film too serious. Why have the person be fat and have a title and promo material revolve around the fact, if it isn't even central to the main story? Unfortunately, it isn't un-serious either. It hangs somewhere in between. Same goes for how the characters are written. They are all interesting more because you can relate to them, as friends if not yourself. But, you aren't exposed to their vulnerabilities or strengths. You are kept guessing and thus find yourself half-way there. Even so, there is something very pleasant about how the camera moves or how the lights are used in a Rajat Kapoor film that make it watchable despite content that isn't quite there. That and an attempt at a topic a little different, even if it's ripped off from here and there, is what makes me look forward to films from this camp of Hindi films. The exuberant display of what Fatso! loves life for is symbolic of the film itself. Starts off delightfully, but sticks to the idea for so long without coming to the point that you can predict the point and exactly how it's going to happen too.

Who would have thought we'd be getting a positive lesson in parenting from a Hindi film and that too at the hands of Sharman Joshi and Satyadeep Misra?","The brand-combination Rajkumar Hirani-Vidhu Vinod Chopra invariably brings a warm film, fairly well-made film. They make very simple use of the tools, no glitter, no glamor, no grit or grim either. Just an outlandish yet sweet story and a very strict focus on their intention, on what it is they want to convey this time. They do touch upon many side issues that come along organically, but they don't lose sight of the basic issue they take up. And like every other time they manage to make me forgive the irritants and go with the flow and enjoy their film for what it is.I'm not taking anything away from director, Rajesh Mapuskar for all the good things going for the film. Just the performances alone make him worthy of all the credit he deserves. It's just that the Hirani-VVC stamp is so resounding in the story-telling. A 12-year old, Kayo (Ritvik Sahore) is good with the cricket bat, exceptionally good. But his curse is that his dad, Rustom (Sharman Joshi) can't afford a training camp in London which Kayo so deserves to go to. Another deterrent is a disgruntled and non-supportive grandfather, Deboo (Boman Irani). And then you join in on a fun trip on how Rustom makes sure his son's aspirations are met. The means Rustom uses put the film in fantasy zone. But, the makers want exactly that - to suck you into the unbelievability of the basic plot and make you root for its characters. Characters which have been beautifully developed. So warm they are, that you let go of your need for unpredictability. Rustom is introduced to you as the ideal citizen who, given his background and the premise of the story, will have to at some point sell his soul. You know Deboo is in dire need of a cathartic moment and he'll have to find it in the next two hours or so. And yet, the how is engaging and entertaining.This brand's weakness for coming up with an over-the-top, even more unbelievable climax is well-known. And they pretty much stick to it. But hey, a few beautiful moments, some wonderful scenes between characters, a heart that's warming you from the inside as you walk out of the theater - if these are the takeaways, why not? But for a moment or two, the climax sticks to the overall tone of the story thus far. The things that happen in those couple of moments are annoying but the quibble in the head dissolves as you accept it, even if grudgingly so.The many issues the film touches upon either in passing or with a little more importance than that and the subtlety with which it's done reaches out to you. From the standard potshot at media behavior and a little more elaborate one at the bureaucracy in Indian sports and well the, law & administration to the irony of Sachin Tendulkar and his Ferrari - Ferrari Ki Sawari covers a broad spectrum.Parenting - the basic theme that it covers - is the one that attaches the film to its audience. The father-son-father relationship is handled with such brilliant charm. It is a battle of generations, it is a battle of parenting styles. The manner in which Rustom (along with Kayo's coach) handles Kayo's aspirations and behavior issues can serve as a parenting guide. In contrast, only to show a mirror to the regular, and if I may add, Indian parenting methodology you have Rustom's dad and another relationship between a politician and his son. Of utmost importance is the missing mother or in fact, any significant female character. And the one woman in a supporting role has very little feminine about her (which is also subtly alluded to in a scene where she just about passes of as a man). As a woman, I am glad Ferrari Ki Sawaari was conscious to keep the lady-factor out. Behind all the Sachin-Sachin and Ferrari-Ferrari the film harps about, is a very strong thread of the relationship of a child with his father. A role that only HE can play. That I haven't mentioned the fantastic performances so far is a testimony to how much else there is going on in the film. Boman Irani - oh what a performer! - his stagger, the lopside of his mouth, the tongue sticking out demonstrating the slug that his life has turned him into, and I can go on. Rustom's simple-mindedness wouldn't have come across if it wasn't for Sharman Joshi's demeanor. Even Seema Bhargava as the jugaadu event manager is as real as any Bombayite could get. Aakash Dhabade as Sachin Tendulkar's domestic help is a huge take away from the film. The small exchange between Paresh Rawal and Boman Irani itself is worth the ticket money for an ardent film-lover.Yes, it would have worked better if the film was shorter. Yes, a few extra characters could have been avoided to make the film crisper. But Ferrari ki Sawaari wasn't intended to be crisp, it was intended to give you that lovely feeling inside. That feeling of having giving in to the fantasy, the feeling of being inspired and involved while watching a fun film, the feeling of having watched a decent film.

A poorly shot and directed film, it is marginally watchable only because of the prospect of Benedict Cumberbatch playing the enigmatic Assange, but even his performance seems laboured. Hopefully, there will be more films to come on who is easily one of the most controversial contemporary figures.","Is there anyone at all in the world who has dared to use the unparalleled power of the World Wide Web towards a more controversial and daring endeavour than WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange? A man who single-handedly shook up the diplomatic establishment with his avante-garde whistleblowers' website, even a cursory read on Assange will tell you that his life is a story worth knowing about.You'd think that it would be pretty hard to mess up a film on the life of a man like Assange; you'd have so much material to go by that you wouldn't need to put in any extra effort to dramatize goings-on, or attempt any technical gimmickry to make things appear interesting. Well, it turns out that the director of the last two Twilight films can, indeed, make such a mess.One of the key problems with Bill Condon's The Fifth Estate is its jarring visual treatment; the gritty, shaky camera and nervous, frequent-cutting were probably employed to keep the audience on the edge at all times, but it just doesn't work. This is the kind of film where you want the writing to do the talking, not the camera or technique. Alas, the narrative of the film is flat, because of a singularly uninspiring screenplay.  The film merely documents some of the key leaks that took the world by storm, while intermittently pausing to show Assange as a well-intentioned but egotistical, stubborn maniac - a man who didn't want to relinquish control simply because he trusted no one. There isn't anything in the film that you don't know or couldn't guess. It is watchable, but rarely anything more.Of course, a large part of the blame lies on the source material of the film. Based on the book 'Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange and the World's Most Dangerous Website' 
by Assange's erstwhile associate Daniel Domscheit-Berg, the film rarely offers any insight into Assange, or rarely delves into any truly thrilling or spectacular secrets that would shock the world. Berg and Assange had a well-known falling out, and while the film doesn't particularly go out of its way to paint Assange in a negative light, it almost seems more like an attempt to exonerate Berg from any blame.All eyes were on Benedict Cumberbatch and his portrayal of the controversial figure. Well, Cumberbatch has clearly tried hard. The problem is that the effort shows. His mannerisms and diction seem effected, though one can't fault him for failing to convey the right emotion. Daniel Brühl, last seen as Niki Lauda in Rush, is excellent as always. He plays the author of the book the film is based on. He at least manages to convince you of his side of the story clearly. Even though Assange's character comes across as merely a slightly unusual piece of cardboard. I doubt that The Fifth Estate will be the last film on the life and times of Julian Assange, because surely there's a whole lot more to the man than what has hitherto been whistled and blown about. While this film is ordinary at best, something far more interesting - in true Assange style - is the open letter that Assange wrote to Benedict Cumberbatch when the film was still in its early days. That letter, at the very least, has a shred of emotion in it.

I don't really know if I can blame the makers for the climax because there aren't too many other ways the film could have gone. But, while Emotional Atyachar lasts, you are promised sharp dialogue from the world of sleaze. Thus you have been warned to the crass language and innuendoes. But the humor is quirky and comes and goes really quick, so you have to be attentive and of course get past the profanity. There are random little things which you might not remember later, but if reminded they are sure to bring a smile. Emotional Atyachar has an absolutely fantastic start. The spooky feel and range of characters builds and maintains intrigue. Right from the wannabe, Gujrati businessman to the muse played by Kalki Koechlin, each character is eccentric in one way or the other and it works. Yep! Even the stereotype works, because of the everyday yet witty dialogue. However, the film suffers the way any 90-minute film with so many characters would. Looks like an inexperienced person had some say in what parts of the story stays out of the film. In a film which otherwise had a decent flow, Emotional Atyachar has a few effects without any apparent causes. For example, why the businessman is refused funding or how does a character free himself after being tied down. The amateur editing also shows in the fact that the 90 minutes run-time is split into 60 minutes pre-interval and 30 minutes post-interval. It makes the film seem longer than it actually is. Which also means any longer and the film would have suffered. So, the editing was necessary but not necessarily done well. Despite that there is enough in the film to warrant a trip to the theater if dark, pulp-type fiction is your kind of entertainment.

The second half, though not boring, becomes cliché-ridden.","It is always heartening to watch the start of an indie film. The excitement that roars from inside as you as you begin liking the film is matched by very few other experiences. Filmistaan gives you exactly that experience. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold up that well through till the end.The dialogue, the performances and the setting hook you in from the beginning. I don't remember the last time I had so many ""laugh out loud""s while watching a film. Sharib Hashmi as the Indian assistant director, who is mistakenly kidnapped by terrorists (Kumud Mishra and Gopal Dutt) and is imprisoned at a localite's, (Inaamulhaq) house, is absolutely endearing.It isn't difficult to believe that he is a well-liked character even if an Indian in a Pakistani village. Of course, as many points to the dialogue department as to Sharib Hashmi, but he charms you with his spoofy wannabe actor do. So much so that, even though Inaamulhaq gives an equally good performance, unfortunately he pales alongside Sharib Hashmi. In further comparison, Kumud Mishra and Gopal Dutt just don't have a deep enough character to even try coming close. But, the desert becomes a character that you look forward to in all the long shots. Almost as if the aridity and dustiness seep into the theater inviting you into the film.  On the other hand, the music is slightly jarring. Not that the songs are bad, just that they didn't belong to the film's genre.The real problem then comes with the second half which isn't explicitly downhill either. It's just that it becomes a little predictable with characters taking clichéd routes. Four characters, four clichés. And as many predictable turn of events as there are situations. The fun yet satirical moments gradually deteriorate into ""oh we left out this obvious point.""And that drops Filmistaan from a 'do not miss' to 'watch when you can'. And that's as saddening as the beginning was heartening, because it hurts to not like a film like Filmistaan.

292,390,390,390,390,Final Destination 5,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/final-destination-5-review/,,,,4.7,"In a way, the Final Destination series breaks many laws of a horror movie genre – in terms of how the death traps are constructed and that’s why the series stands out. The 5th installment manages to include a few funny moments, without making you feel sick for laughing over someone’s death – and there’s a winner. It does, however, become all about the blood and gore. Hence, don’t go watch the film if you fainted in the 11th grade after attempting to dissect a frog. ","Death did not enjoy the extended weekend, with Final Destination 5 releasing in 3D. Death (personified rather creepily by Tony Todd, the only recurring member of the series) had to perform its seasonal rituals, against those who defied the rules of the cosmic universe. It was Independence Day for some, and a gruesome travel to their ‘final destination’ for an unfortunate few. It’s been 12 years since the first Final Destination movie blew us away, with its clever premise and not much has changed plot wise, with the fifth installment. Since the first bunch of people escaped the Flight 180 crash, Death has been standing guard – through 4 more films – at anybody who dare defy the cosmic laws of the universe. One by one, each person gets scratched out and you can’t help but think of Death as a Death Eater prototype, sitting in a grey cloud with a notepad of all the names. However, 5 movies later, a clever premise has now been transformed into a grotesque, gory parade of jaw droppers. You could easily watch the entire movie through the slit between your fingers, while your hand covers your eyes. If you’ve followed the series from the first film, you will sense a slight disappointment. But for those of you who are just in for the blood and gore, Final Destination 5 is money well spent. Final Destination 5 has a brand new cast, mostly from television series. Sam (Nicolas D'Agosto, from Heroes) is the one who sees a premonition about a breaking bridge. The lucky few who manage to escape include Emma Bell (The Walking Dead) playing Sam’s girlfriend; Miles Fisher (Gossip Girl) also Sam's coworker and best friend; and P.J.Byrne (Horrible Bosses) as a distant co-worker. Director Steven Quayle, also James Cameron’s protégé, leaves no stone unturned with regard to visual effects. For once, the usage of 3D is justified, when the characters are all burnt, boiled, poked, laser-ed to death. While the premise remains ( rather predictably at that), somehow you feel through the years, this franchise has become more about the blood and gore than about visually playing out one of the most interesting concepts to come out of the movies.The cinematography is in line with the genre, we intercut between slow establishing scenes and fast-paced cuts of the death scenes. The film maintains a blue tone, and when coupled with eerie background score provides a true horror experience. If you get time to think between flying objects whooshing at you and blood drops splattering across the screen, you’ll realize the film approaches the most superficial part of your psyche – and so, it becomes that much more important to bring that out to discuss. It’s a typical discussion; one which adopts a to-each-their-own fixation. If you like such films, this one’s a good weekend investment. But somewhere you will realize the film could have taken another direction – one that dealt with the topic of death and destiny, more symbolically and thematically.

293,391,391,391,391,Finding Fanny,Watch when on TV/online,wogma reviewNotepadPreview37 Critic Reviews 3.9/5.0 6 Reader Reviews 4/5.0 102 Tweet Reviews 3.1/5.0,/movie/finding-fanny-review/,3.9/5.0,4/5.0,3.1/5.0,3.666666667,The much promised eccentricity doesn't live throughout and you slowly lose interest in characters in this character-centric film. Yet worth a watch for the performances even if some are caricatures.,"A film that starts with a voiceover, however lovely the voice and what it has to say, feels likes a cop out. Save for a couple of times, I have felt that the voiceover is just an escape from having to show us the characters, instead you are just told about them. Almost, as if you were reading out the character wikipedia entry. Finding Fanny warms up after this initial put-off, only to set into a routine very soon. From then on it is flat, if not a ride on a downward slope.When the ride starts and the film gets into second gear I loved how enterprising Angie (Deepika Padukone)  is in getting the other characters join the road-trip to find Freddie's (Naseeruddin Shah) love Fanny. She has each one of them believe it was their decision to make them do what she wants them to do. The means and the end are equally quirky. But, then that is the peak of the eccentricity. After this point the craziness is either too forced (a la a caricatured Vladimir) or too flat. This is a shame because individually the characters are uniquely funny. The humor is dark and it plays out quite well. Yes, of course, each one of the characters is a caricature, some more so than the others, yet they are entertaining and engaging. Savio (Arjun Kapoor) the most normal of them all, is also the flattest character - maybe because he is normal. His outburst though comes out of nowhere. But in this crazy bunch, he brings a bit of a balance along with Angie. Angie is sweet, composed and a romantic. At the same time she is creative and gives a whiff that if she has made up her mind, she can get what she wants. This is why, her character's arch seems to be a little too out there. Given that she has the confidence of getting away with anything, it is a mystery why she waited so long for what was playing on her mind. Her strong-headed mother-in-law, Rosie (Dimple Kapadia) on the other hand is the coconut of the group - hard on the outside hiding a soft inner self, but feeling empty deep within. Now see, herein lies the biggest flaw of the film. This thing that Rosie is empty deep within, is not something that I deduced because of what went on in the film, it is because another character spells it out. Again, out of nowhere. That character being Pedro (Pankaj Kapoor). Easily the quirkiest of them all, Pedro is shallow and openly so. His pervert eye is omnipresent in the film and uncomfortable, even though deep down you know he won't be causing too much harm. It is a bit of a shocker when he makes an insightful observation of another character then. I'm not saying people who are overtly shallow are incapable of making deeper inferences. It's just that when the remark comes, not only is it over-dramatic which makes it out of place in this otherwise non-dramatic film, but it also comes out of nowhere. Do you see, the trend here. The way the characters behave towards the end are very uncharacteristic of the way they have been defined for us till then. It almost made me feel like the end was written before everything else and everything else that came before was a means to that end. For a film that seemed to be about enjoying the journey this is too much of a mismatch. I am all for characters behaving out of character, but I feel left-out and thus uninterested if I am not in on what brought about the deviation?The only consistent character then is that of Freddie whose quest is at the center of the film. His quest for finding his love. The beauty of his search is that it's not with the intention of wanting reciprocation. He just wants his feelings known. Unfortunately, the way the quest ends is such a bummer then. Yes, Finding Fanny is more about these characters than it is about the story itself. Which is why each of these characters needed a little more to them than just an initial character sketch. A little more detail, a little more backstory. Thankfully, the characters had brilliant actors to play them out. I doubt there is any other word that would describe him other than ""sulky"" - which might be the one-word brief he got from the director; which is what he portrays very well and consistently by sulking. Deepika Padukone plays Angie the reason for Savio's sulk. She is very aware of her affect on him and uses it too. There was this glimpse of what a wonderful actor she can be in Love Aaj Kal. Finding Fanny allows her to show us that through the film and she makes the most of it. She uses her eyes to convey it all.A complain that is held against the character, Rosie, but can never be held against the actor that plays her Dimple Kapadia. As gorgeous as ever, padded hips notwithstanding, the lady stumps me every time I see her on screen with how well she makes me forget the actor that's playing it. And I could and would use the exact same words to describe Naseeruddin Shah's portrayal of Freddie. The only one who stuck out for me as an over-done is Pankaj Kapoor. I am sure that was on the director's command. But, he sticks out like a sore thumb with the exaggerated portrayal of his character's craziness. Sure, he's done it well, but wouldn't the challenge have been a better one to underplay that zany character to fit in with the rest of the film?A word on the Goan atmosphere and language before I close - it really worked for me. So did the background music, even if it were too loud at times. It would indeed have been nice to experiment with a few scenes, especially the romantic ones, without any music. Another film, maybe. Once again something that sticks out as forced. Which can be said about the film's summary that Angie spells out for us in the end. Such a clean-cut, sliced and diced ending is not what a dark humored film like this one deserves. Even so, it is nice to have a change of pace and scenery from the typical Hindi film. Always welcome.

The entire range of characters verbalize or remain silent but communicate effectively.,"Firaaqisn't the first film about the communal riots in Gujrat. And it isn't the first well-made film either. You can sense each character being approached with sensitivity yet there's no attempt at sensationalizing by gory visuals or lengthy dialogue or dramatizing trauma. All of these have huge potential and are often used in movies with this backdrop.As dead bodies are passed along in the first few scenes you know this is going to be serious business. And Firaaq offers no respite. Male chauvinism, identity crisis, communal differences effecting friendship, impact of violence on a young mind, a philosopher's hope, rebel by the suppressed, an innocent victim's helplessness, misuse of the angst created, and ultimately the mother of all issues - no solution in sight. All of these are brought to you one after the other, relentlessly. These facets of human nature rightly need a variety of characters. The effort behind writing each character shows clearly. Sure some of them, like a chauvinist Gujrati husband (Paresh Rawal) or an agitated Muslim (Nowaz) might have been easier to write because they play on the standard stereotypes. But, others like the sensitized house-wife (Deepti Naval), the confused urban businessman (Sanjay Suri) have been worked hard upon. Use of multiple languages adds to the realistic environment created. A sudden line of profundity comes in just like one person from a group of friends might spurt one out while arguing about some socially relevant issue. And yet the movie is not entirely engaging. It could be because it offers no closure but that also leaves a sense of incompleteness. for a movie so careful about what it's trying to say, there were some scenes which didn't really belong. It’s difficult to imagine that they were there without a purpose but because I didn't understand them they distracted me. White, black or gray - not one actor leaves an ounce of doubt in terms of believability - including some of the side characters. Again with a film so full of brilliant performances, it's difficult to name one even if it is the most senior of them. Because even a child with his blank eyes contributes equally to the film as do the veterans. There aren't any strong fundamentalist characters who are propagating their agenda. So there are no lectures. In fact you see how situational each character's behavior is. There are some brilliant moments that are subtly enacted which are better experienced than read about in a review.Firaaqvery, very carefully doesn't take sides. There are as many ""good"", ""evil"", and ""indifferent"" characters from both Hindu and Muslim communities. If at all, it points a finger, it aims a big fat one at the bias of the state's administration. As with any film that has multiple stories running in parallel there are jerky cuts. But these are kept at a minimum and on the contrary some transitions are done really well. It's also nice to hear the background music come about only occasionally. That grants so much more subtlety to the entire film. The aftermath of the riots in Gujrat is captured by the trauma that each human in the city is facing. And of course, Firaaqalso talks about the non-humans who looked upon this as an opportunity and took advantage to their fullest capacity.

Despite its rather plain storytelling, the issue the film talks about is enough to grip, move and anger you.","Dylan Mohan Gray’s Fire in the Blood is a documentary on a burning issue that perhaps none of us truly paid attention to. But when we first hear of it in the context of this film, it won’t particularly surprise us too much either. I mean, we all know that multi-billion corporations will do what it takes to multiply those billions. Yet, as we watch the film gradually unfold, we realize the sheer magnitude of the problem, and it is shocking. We’ve all been exposed to the blood-curdling visuals and statistics of how diseases like AIDS have ravaged so much of Africa and the rest of the developing world. The film talks about how large pharmaceutical companies in the West work solely driven by their bottom line; how providing low cost drugs to those who are in dire need isn’t a concern for them at all.What becomes both the weakness as well as the strength of Fire in the Blood is the fact that there is almost no technical or creative accomplishment in the film. The visuals are plain, the narrative is driven by interviews, and the music score is bland at best. Instinctively, you’d think that an issue like this, had it been backed by haunting imagery and an interesting narrative style, would have truly been memorable. Still, complete credit to Gray for not going down that route, and choosing to stick to his bare minimum narrative that focuses on the issue alone, and nothing else. It also tells us just how impactful the issue really is. It doesn’t need any further embellishment to create an impact. It also really makes us question where humanity is headed; why and on what grounds do we value one life more than the other, and what will it take for the corporate machinery to realize that some things are more important than profit. For its complete honesty and adherence to only the issue that it chooses to talk about and nothing else, Fire in the Blood is a film as well as a movement that must be supported. Only when the entire world begins to ask tough questions of those who deserve it, will wheels of change begin to churn.

Ironically, the heart though, is kept at bay.","Fitoor has dream-like visuals. In that sense it completely absorbs you in its world. But, unfortunately, only the visuals are arresting, and to an extent the atmosphere that the music creates. The story however, as it progresses, does its best to disengage you from itself. No number of good-looking people can save you from that then.It would be unfair to say that Aditya Roy Kapoor and Katrina Kaif are only appealing to the eye and have nothing to offer in the acting department. There are subtle sighs and eye movements that add to the essence of the scene. But, to ask them to hold a film on their pretty shoulders, is a bit much. We have seen Aditya Roy Kapoor sulk and carry a morose air about him through a film, so this does come across as a repeat performance. And, Katrina Kaif (and even the child artist who plays her character's younger role) plays femme fatale quite well. But given her gorgeousness, she doesn't need to do much . However, for a change this time around with the extra layer of charming fat on her cheeks, she comes across as homely too. Tabu is enigmatic too, but her character comes across as forcibly so and then gets a tad too dramatic towards the end.However, a romance where there is more chemistry between the characters when they aren't together compared to when they finally do get together, has got its grammar wrong somewhere. The disconnect when they are together would have been alright too, if it were not for the climax chosen. Except for the first half hour, where our protagonists are growing up, the story is fragmented. You don't know why these people are so madly in love with each other. Love at first sight and puppy love? Sure, I will take that as a given and enjoy the intensity of obsessive love. Despite this acceptance though, the details are sorely missing. Fitoor comes across as an extremely superficial view of the couple's love for each other – both in longevity and intensity. Similarly, the political angle is touched upon rather perfunctory. It's like the writers knew, the love story wouldn't be enough by itself and needed some other meat to hold the viewers' interest. Fitoor is Vishal Bharadwaj's eccentrity combined with a Sanjal Leela Bhansali's visual acumen. And yet that doesn't end up being a compliment. Maybe a case of too many influences spoil the broth?

A film that will get “well-intended, heart in the right place” nominations. ","A Flying Jatt takes the good vs. evil theme a bit too seriously. Sure, you can't expect anything less from a superhero film. But, A Flying Jatt takes every opportunity it gets to hammer a message down. I don't know what is worse – that it does so, or that it does so after avoiding it for the first half. The first half treats the audience with some respect, allowing them to figure at least some stuff out by themselves. Post-interval it feels like the writers get the jitters and don't want to leave anything to chance. They quite literally spell out every thing. Like the film's metaphors for good and evil are clearly defined, to such an extent that they aren't representations any more. In fact, it is stretched out a bit too far.The story book + fairy tale kind of narration makes you wonder if A Flying Jatt would have worked as a kids' film? Nope. One because it isn't marketed as such. Two, because the urban kids are just exposed to a lot better – in terms of story, action and performances. I won't even bring up the CGI, etc.The movie even tries its hand at humor. It goes into spoof mode for a bit. However, the joke either falls flat because it goes on for too long  or it ends up being slapsticky. And of course, Amrita Singh and Jacqueline Fernandez screaming and squeaking respectively, can hardly be called humor. Tiger Shroff stumbling and stuttering as he plays a martial arts teacher can make you smile only so much. By the way, here's a quiz question – in which movie does Tiger Shroff play a character that doesn't require him to be a muscular guy who can do stunts, if not a martial artist? Hint: Trick question.Jacqueline Fernandez' character, Kirti just makes it a point to highlight how pointless she is. Even Amrita Singh's character seems like a placeholder for strong women, as if to check the “feminism” box. Oh, and it hurt to see Kay Kay Menon reduced to a caricatured villain. Yet again.Sure, A Flying Jatt has good intentions. But the moment you go all, “holier than thou” with speeches and history lessons, the cause is lost. The analogy of today's super-heros and villains was one thing that could have worked in favor of A Flying Jatt. Alas.

Following  allows you that liberty while letting you bask in the visual genius that the film is. It’s a maze – a complicated maze revealing much about the plight of a writer “between jobs” and the warped people he meets. It’s a film revolving around voyeurism, how personally you want to know random people and how that very trait can get you into trouble.","In a way, watching a movie falls under a voyeuristic activity. You break into a fictitious character’s life/head and watch them as they unfold as per their logic and then pass your opinion on how the events play out. This experience is not different from Nolan’s first semi-feature length film Following. Released before Memento, Following has the same amount of genius as any of his other films, yet for some reason remains rare. Maybe in that lies the charm of the film. The movie surrounds Bill (Jeremy Theobald) who is obsessed with following people but never really interacts with them. He meets Cobb (Alex Haw) who not only follows people but also breaks into their homes and tries to understand their personal lives. It’s a familiar labyrinthine structure, but not a predictable one. While following Cobb around, Bill meets a fascinating woman (Lucy Russel) and through intercutting, non-linear narratives and flashbacks you’ll be left with only guesses and calculations about the climax of the film. The calculations are not like mental math though – it’ll be like a stimulating lavender bath where your mind will spurn out conclusions and permutations automatically, and your body will be transported into the head of the lead character before you even realize it. If you loved Memento, The Prestige or Inception, Following has a similar pattern but it’s so strong in it’s premise and treatment it only reminds you in bits that you’re watching a Nolan film. He’s used a typical non-linear structure, his protagonist is edgy and the background score is hauntingly merging but every now and then you feel you’ve slipped back in time, into a Noir crime film with low-key/split lighting and ruptured camera movements. In all this confusion, Following lets you sit back and enjoy the fall of time, genre and logic. The film was shot on almost a negligible budget, so when you pick the DVD without any special features you’re curious to know how it was managed. It could have been even more interesting to have a featurette or even an interview with Nolan about his vision of the film culminated into Following.Following is like a rugged, black and white poster that has come to life for 70 mins. It stuns you, in a post-modern way and leaves you confused. You can’t just watch it. You’ll have to become a stalker, and compulsively follow the visuals. The movie demands it.

Possibly an instruction manual outlining the secrets of the Buddha fist and the Hollow Palm technique!
Jet Li and Jackie Chan star in the Forbidden Kingdom and since they are such big stars we get them twice over! Jet Li and Jackie Chan have both got double roles in this rollicking, adventure movie aimed at the summer crowd who would enjoy a good action fantasy.   The script follows the format of the Journey of the Hero as outlined by Joseph Campbell, and is simple.  The director does not waste time in building character and goes straight to the point.  There is a bad guy, the Jade Emperor, and then there are an unlikely collection of misfits including a drunker scholar (Jackie Chan), a silent monk (Jet Li), a beautiful girl (Yifei Liu), and the teen protagonist (Michael Angarano), who is the only one who does not know any kungfu.    Throw in a white haired witch (BingBing Li) and what you have is a potent mixture.  The story is ostensibly based on characters from Chinese mythology and the characters exist to drive the plot.  Unlike other Jackie Chan films, the tone of the film does not have too much of slapstick except in some sequences, and remains true to the Jackie Chan code of not showing blood and gore ( a principle that was ignored in Jackie Chan’s film The Myth).  Jet Li is his inscrutable self in the beginning and then becomes comical possibly under Jackie’s influence.  The title sequence of the film is over laid on posters from Kung Fu films of the 70 and 80’ and one quickly recognizes Gordon Liu from 36 Chamber of Shaolin, and of course, the Boss – Bruce Lee.  Having paid his tributes, the director then throws in references to the kung fu styles seen in thousands of films, with names like the Drunken Fist ( remember Jackie Chan’s Drunken Master), the Tiger style, the Eagle ( Snake in the Eagle’s shadow, again with Jackie Chan), and the Preying Mantis.
Woo – Ping Yuen, the acclaimed martial arts choreographer of the Matrix and Kill Bill series, not to forget Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon delivers superbly.  He keeps the action restrained and does not go for over the top indulgences.  Thus we do not get to see people flying around and neither are there seemingly impossibly leaps and maneuvers.  What we get instead is good realistic action set pieces with superb kung fu: terrific blows, blocks, weapons of various sorts being deployed including jade darts and long hair, and the kung fu staple of leg to leg action.  The fight between Jet Li and Jackie Chan is terrific, with both heroes getting a chance to show off their skills to the hilt without over doing it.  Woo also keeps the fight sequences short and tight, thus keeping the average viewer’s interest in mind.  The film has none of the high philosophy and romantic lyricism of Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; neither does it have the dark, brutal undercurrents of films like Old Boy and Romeo Must Die.  It is also not a classic kung fu chopstick film in that it does not have extended fight sequences in various kung fu styles and the standard ingredients of revenge and retribution.  What it does have is good fun, great fights, and two of the biggest stars of contemporary martial arts displaying their mastery.  It also has some Zen dialogues, and a message: a simplistic one perhaps, but one that will definitely warm the cockles of one’s heart!

300,398,398,398,398,Force,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewNotepadPreview37 Critic Reviews 2.1/5.0 7 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/force-review/,2.1/5.0,4/5.0,,3.05,"Force is a perfect masala film, which also means, it is perfectly predictable. And yet, Force keeps you engaged. It has everything in the right proportion - romance, action, drama. But it doesn't have that one overwhelming factor which can make me recommend it to you without any reservations. I have to add caveats like, if you are into hard-core action, if you like borderline genuine romance, if you don't mind the two interrupting each other, then watch it for sure. ","If you made a list of things that an ideal action-romance film should have. Force would have checkmarks in all the boxes. 
When you consider the overall package, it isn't a film that you HAVE to rush to the theater to. It's a good-looking film which balances the tightrope of narrating a story with simplicity and fulfills its ""commercial"" obligations. But, it misses out on having that something extra - call it a zing, call it a soul. As I write these words, to my own eye I come across as a slave-driver who expects the world out of her movies. But, there is something out of place, when I am making a checklist and thinking aloud, ""everything is there, then why did it feel so choppy, so functional?"" The generic treatment given to Force is rather clinical. But, there are scenes that work. Some action sequences are grueling enough to make you want them to stop. The romance has a couple of genuine moments, as in you can see why these two are falling in love with each other, the gap that they fill in each other's' lives is clear. The villain is intelligent and not some caricatured, over-stylized ""creature"". In fact, he is a handsome villain. I don't remember the last time a villain could have passed off as the hero. Which also means the casting is perfect. And that's not limited to Vidyut Jamwal who plays Vishnu - note the irony - the destroyer of all things good, the villain. John Abraham couldn't have been cast better. He has to play an honest Asst. Commissioner of Police who has no family or friend ties because he wants to focus on his work. So single-minded is he in his work that, he is called sookha jhaad - a dead tree. And if there's anyone in the industry who can play a dead tree, John Abraham is the man! And no, there is no sarcasm here. I say this with utmost sincerity that this was perfect casting. His muscles make him drool-worthy and the grit on his face makes him a great, rigid police officer. Genelia D'Souza passes off as a breath of fresh air that she needs to be in such a sullen environment. But, nothing anyone else couldn't have carried off neither something we haven't seen her do earlier. That Force is a perfect, typical masala film is both its strength and its weakness. You enjoy it while it lasts, but it doesn't linger on any of your senses. When good people die, you feel bad, but your heart doesn't reach out to them. When evil people die, you are relieved, but you are not that angry at him that you want to see his meat minced. You are engaged in the 2+ hours but you are not involved.

That has value in itself though it doesn't really demand your seat to be on the edge.,"Fox is the writer-director's angst against unethical lawyers and could extend to any profession that is meant to help the common man but is most likely used to save the minority - rich. An awesome concept that could lead to a social awakening and all that jazz, but that's not the intention here. It saves us the lectures and turns it into a story which unfortunately is far-fetched and leaves some important questions unanswered. While Fox has one of the best cliffhangers at interval, the film is still largely predictable. And that is a little because of the way it's written and more because of the costumes, make-up, background music, camerawork, etc. And that is a huge bummer. There are some parts of the writing which work, like the going is not easy for the protagonists. They are as flabbergasted by the turn of events as the audience and trying whatever they can. But, it also has the usual lapses in character sketches where a smart character very conveniently turns naïve.  Arjun Rampal (Arjun Kapoor) plays a self-absorbed lawyer. Though Kapoor's dilemma in the beginning comes a little too quick, Rampal convincingly looks both agitated and at peace when Kapoor needs to be. There's nothing very new for Sunny Deol (Crime Branch officer, Yashwant Deshmukh) to do, so he goes through the drill mustering up all the interest he can. Sagarika Ghatge (Arjun's girlfriend, Urvashi) and Udita Goswami (a leading publisher, Sophie) have token roles and are made to arrive and depart from the screen at will. That both Sophie and Urvashi are required to wear as revealing clothes as possible irrespective of whether they are at work or in a police station, tells us why they are in this script.Sure, Fox is not completely smart or well-thought out, but a murder suspense that doesn't have money and 100% revenge as the killer's motivation deserves some plus points.

Having you root for the actor, not the character, doesn't bode well for a film.","There is a certain amount of drama necessary in a film that is about a sports underdog. You need something to root for the protagonist. You don't really need an antagonist. The circumstances usually play enough of a villain. Freaky Ali, unfortunately has you rooting for Nawazuddin Siddiqui, the actor who plays Freaky Ali and not Ali himself. Ali is as uninteresting a character as it can get. Sure, he is given plenty of analogies as one line quips. But, they barely bring a smile. In fact, a lot of them are outright cheesy. Nawazuddin Siddiqui's dialogue delivery and body language lends them some dignity and hence make them tolerable. It actually, physically hurts to not like a film with an actor of Nawazuddin Siddiqui's calibre. The other performances are like those you would find in any other loud, slapstick film. In fact, that is what a lot of Freaky Ali ultimately is, an attempt at slapstick comedy with a coherent story. There it achieves its purpose. But in entertaining us, it does not. The story by itself is like any other sports drama except that the drama is just not enough. Yes, it is tough for me to accept that I am asking for more drama. This is despite our hero Ali being in a situation that is closing in on him from both sides. The problem is that all the elements exist - romantic angle, the betrayal, the hardship, the setbacks – but they all seem rather perfunctory. None of them get your attention, let alone make it pique. Of course, it is all predictable – that is a given for any underdog story anyway, isn't it? There is only so much an ordinary story can stand on its actor's shoulders. Even if they are as broad as that of Nawazuddin Siddiqui.

Debutante Lijin Jose makes a bright start with this daring thriller. ","Boasting of a large ensemble cast and more characters than are absolutely necessary, debutante director Lijin Jose’s Friday is an often meandering but still engaging effort, one that must be lauded for its sheer audacity in terms of the number of stories that are woven together.Set in the time span of a day, a Friday to be precise, the film jumps between various characters, ordinary people like you and me, many of whom have come for various reasons via ferry into the town of Alappuzha, better known to non-Keralites as Alleppey.The characters range from an irritable autorickshaw driver, a family headed by a father whose youngest daughter is to be married in a week, a childless couple who intend to adopt a young girl, a couple of hoodlums who are trying to sell some sort of exotic animal on the sly, a pregnant beggar woman with another child in her hand, and many, many more stories and characters. In fact, even as I listed the ones I did, I thought of so many more that I haven’t.There are so many characters and stories in Friday that about three quarters of an hour are spent just establishing them. That is perhaps the one big flaw in the film – it could easily have done without so many of the characters and stories, and have still been just as engaging.Nevertheless, once each story reaches its own little turning point, the film picks up steam. The film then proceeds at breakneck speed as every story hurtles towards its own little ending, even as a number of the hitherto unrelated characters come together for a larger, more conventional climax. One of the problems with having so many stories running parallel is the fact that there are too many false climaxes and resolutions. I could sense some of the more fidgety members of the audience desperately wondering what exactly was going on. The narrative is by no means complex, but it demands your total attention in order to truly make sense of what is going on.The experience of immersing yourself into the lives of so many characters is made even more convincing because of the actors playing the characters. Fahad Fazil is excellent as the autorickshaw driver in need of money, who is then faced with a moral dilemma. Thespian Nedumudi Venu is pitch perfect as the hassled father of the bride-to-be, while Vijayraghavan playing the kindly police office helping them out is excellent as well. Many of the other performances, too many to list out, are fairly convincing.What really works for the film is that each of the stories depicts the life of a real person, carving out a little slice of it for the audience to savour. The parallel narrative, something that I always enjoy, adds to the overall experience. The last few moments of the film were daring, something that very few filmmakers would have attempted.While there are no standout technical achievements in the film, with the cinematography and background score being purely functional, credit must be given to the editor for handling so many stories and weaving them together without ever making the audience wait too long for the next snippet of each story. Going back to the background score, I often felt that the choice of background pieces during certain scenes was poor, detracting from the intended impact of the scene rather than adding to it.In spite of its hiccups, Friday is still a film that is worth a watch. It is heartening to see a young filmmaker have the vision to attempt something that is by no means easy and manage to justice to it for the most. Lijin Jose is a director to watch out for and Friday is a film that I’d recommend to anyone who likes being completely engaged and involved in a film.

Does Arrenofsky have an answer for that one? Or it is just the joy of being a part of light film? While No Strings Attached (released earlier in the year with Ashton Kutcher and Portman) was a poorly written film, Friends With Benefit is sharper and better performed. But is it different on any other account?Friends With Benefit is an intelligent film. We are forced to ignore that the film falls prey to the same age-old stereotypes that it mocks all throughout the first half of the film – because the lead pair is just so .. pretty. The film revolves around two emotionally damaged/unavailable people – Jamie (Mila Kunis) who’s a placement agent and Dylan (Justin Timberlake) who becomes the art editor at GQ magazine through Jamie. They agree that they don’t want relationships and realize that they’d be better off as friends who indulge in casual sex. Well, that’s a revelation. Because we really haven’t heard that one before. We are then taken through a good 45 mins of the yummy two in their bare essentials, getting frisky all over the place. Reason no 1 to like the film. The first half is funny, smart and a total win because it makes you want to rethink when you were in such a situation and how that went horribly wrong (ouch). You wonder – if they’re having so much fun it must actually be a plausible alternate to the big L. They flip through corny rom-coms on TV and make fun of it, they mock their exes and most importantly they don’t cuddle, romance or get mushy. Reason no 2. What we ignore to see (or are made to) is that Jamie is actually a die-hard romantic. She claims to genuinely believe in true love and a prince charming because of a troubled childhood. So while they go through their steamy sessions of casual-ness, and while a small part of you wants to freeze the near-perfect scenario, you know what’s in store during the next half of the film.

Yada yada, fights, tears, heavy background music later Friends With Benefit is the same film that Timberlake and Kunis make fun of in the first half. Clichés abound. The real conflict is in your head. Do you like the film or do you not? It’s a good looking film, Friends With Benefit. Set in New York, it makes you want to move and live “the good life”. The background score has a pop music bounce to it – which in Timberlake’s words, “makes you believe you had a good time watching the film”. The pace of the film is crisp, so it doesn’t allow you to analyze whilst drooling over the lead pair. It’s only after you leave that you realize the shortcomings of the film. Director Will Gluck admits to making a film that wouldn’t stand at PG 13, because “they (the lead pair) realize that they’re in a romantic comedy story — as two regular people who aren’t in a movie would comment on” and act accordingly. Hence the “reality” - casual sex, denial and conflict. But what about the clichéd, mushy end? Oh that’s just the Hollywood studio’s requirement, I hear.

And the punch in the climax tries way too hard to impress and fails miserably.,"It doesn't take too long to come to terms with the fact that you are going to be watching a black and white film for the next two hours. It is different and thus it engages. The lack of color accentuates the Himalayan ruggedness. It takes only a few minutes to wipe off all romanticized images created by earlier movies shot in this terrain. The painful struggle of day-to-day life needs no words. And yet, words you will crave to hear by the end of the two hours - so long are some of the pauses and so dull are some of the voiceovers. You don’t miss the color, even though some parts actually look like the frames have been bleached. And early on, the silences seem very artistic, and your time is fruitfully utilized in soaking in the scenery. But as the minutes pass by, the view gets monotonous and the silence becomes snooze-time. In the effort to get the mood right, the story-telling suffers. The premise is actually mundane - troubled hard-worker's goods won't sell because mechanization is taking over, his loans become an excuse for the money-lenders to cast their lecherous eyes on his beautiful daughter. But the character quirks in the beginning make them look like they'll grow interesting. The daughter does look troubled and a tad abnormal, playful - maybe a bit too childish for her age. But, by the time you realize why she seems off, you've lost interest in the film, let alone its characters. At the end, you wonder what actually was the intention of the film. Was it to make us aware of the hardships of the inhabitants of the Leh-Ladakh region - an area which we think of as beautiful, but brutality seeps deep within? Was it to narrate the story of Lasya - a teenager who is disturbed and the world around her seems treacherous? But the pathos doesn't come through. You don't really feel for her, her family or the place they call home.The supposed punch in the end is too sudden and forcefully abnormal and ""artistic"" to remain of any interest. The lack of interesting events in the last hour or so give you no motivation to decipher or interpret the possibilities of metaphors and the likes. It still doesn't take away from the fact that something different was tried. So what if the timing was off. Danny Denzongpa as the hard-working yet unsuccessful jam seller and Gauri who plays his daughter Lasya both do their best to intrigue. I don't remember Danny in such an intense role earlier. And Gauri is both beautiful and talented. I'd be inclined to say her beauty is more forthcoming because of the monochrome. But all these still do not make for a compelling or captivating watch. Sure, it's noteworthy that the typical emotional triggers are missing and thus the cinematic experience is refreshing.

And ends up being a different means to achieve the same end, like umpteen other slapstick - ridiculous yet unentertaining. Result - no laughs here either!","You see Boman Irani in the horrendous get-up and you know the next two hours aren't going to be very bright. But then again, you are an ardent movie buff, right? No wonder you are reading the review of a Hindi film called Fruit and Nut or, like in my case, at the threshold of a theater playing it. Thus you are here with a sliver of hope, a faith in Boman Irani and Diya Mirza's choice of scripts. HA HA! You have been made into a nut case and that's about the only laugh there is related to the film. It can't be that bad, you think? Bald and wigged villain kidnaps beautiful damsel because he wants the map to a gutter underneath the state assembly building in Mumbai. Co-villain(?) joins in mid-way to achieve the same purpose, except that everyone changes their aims and objectives conveniently. Some because they are actually serving the purpose of protecting heritage against the big bad mall-ification of the city. Except that you are not interested a teeny-weeny bit. It is a madcap storyline that slapstick lovers relish. The point, they say, is in the chaos where the aim is to make the impossible possible - believable or not is another story. You want madcap? You got MADCAP!! By the ton and more. Everything, every single micro-element of the film is filled with nonsense. Each character is a caricatured caricature. Each movement on screen is an attempt to make the audience laugh at some character or the others' misfortune. Which translates to 'Oh, so not funny'. And the quintessential loudness of the genre adds to the pandemonium. There seems to be a satirical comment on the trends of urban life while also spoofing Hindi slapstick films. Only that can explain the above average absurdity and disconnect in the dialogues. Especially the lines given to Khandar (Mahesh Manjrekar). A lot of pun used but none with any connection to anything. Anyway in hindsight, it feels like a farfetched theory and me trying my best to find meaning in the chaos. Anyway, though I understand this is not my kind of humor, I doubt it has anything for the genre-buffs either. When 100 minutes get a bit too much to stay put in the seat, you know all has gone wrong.

This one takes on way too much and takes way too much time to express itself too. ","Four friends. One girl, three boys. Delhi. Attitude times a few. To top it off, one of them is a cabinet minister's son. They seem to be interested in just having a good time. Given this set-up Fugly actually caught me by surprise when a group of four friends who seemed interested only in having a good time got worked up about social issues - be it eve-teasing or the law and order-politician nexus. It is a shame then, that Fugly doesn't capitalize on the fact that these issues touch the characters' lives personally and ours too. Despite it being so easy to identify with them, we could barely care about what happens to them.The culprit is the paradoxical pace. There is so much going on in the film to the extent that it almost feels like a thriller. Yet, the dramatization, the slow-motions, the extra time spent on elaborating on a scene - kills the film. I am a huge fan of silences and impregnated moments. I love lingering scenes. But, Fugly shows how that can go all wrong when you want to tell the maker, ""Got it, move on already!"" I guess there is a time, a place and a movie for everything.The four lead characters are played by actors who are either too loud or too flat. Amongst the other actors, of course only Jimmy Sheirgill looks like someone we can take seriously. But, then again, he becomes repetitive and predictable. I doubt any of this can be blamed on the actors when the writing is haywire - in screenplay and dialogue. The story by itself is interesting, but it has these irrelevant sub-plots. Almost like, before coming up with the story the writers came up with a list of the issues they wanted to address - eve-teasing, corruption in law and order, hooliganism and ruthlessness in politics, angst of the youth, insensitivity of the media, prositution, gay prostitution, rave parties and so on. They then came up with a story to fit in everything. And that's no way to tell a story, is it?The song and dance sequences further break the jarred flow. They only make matters worse with run-time already stretched beyond patience levels due to some editing/screenplay decisions. Style can add to content, but not this laboured kind of style.I'd still like to believe that Fugly could've been a different film, even better maybe, if they fixed the pace issue. But then again, maybe that would be a different film altogether.

Quirky and fun in the second half, it is a pain to go through in the first half though.","You can tell the writers of Fukrey are in love with their characters and it is a joy to see the writers so invested in their characters. Except they get carried away. The introduction is so slow that even when fun quirkiness sets in, you have to literally been jerked out of drowsiness. The character exposition is so tardy and lacklustre that you wonder how you are going to spend the next two hours. And while it is good to see writers who care so deeply about the audience's understanding of the characters, they don't go beyond the initial set-up. As the movie develops, you don't really discover anything new, let alone interesting about most of the characters. However, as the movie progresses a couple of characters get into their element and bring life into the film, Chucha (Varun Sharma) and Bholi Punjabi (Richa Chaddha). Their characters' quirks and the language they use add zing to the film. That Chucha uses his dreams to win lotteries combined with his outlandish sense of humor, gradually wake you up and you begin to expect a peak in the film's comedy.  Bholi's brash lady-goon reminds you of Neha Dhupia's Munni gangster from Phas Gaya Re Obama and you are happy that you are enjoying her role better. She seems more at home with the language and the mannerisms.Yet, only two characters and the actors who perform them can take a movie only so far. Also ultimately, the movie wants to become greater than what it has been so far and forces a message in. In addition, there is this fact that all the main characters are pretty much losers who you don't feel much for or identify with. Sure, the two characters take away a lot of the credit, but the other actors do a great job too. Especially the women, Vishakha Singh and Priya Anand. I especially enjoyed scenes between Priya Anand and Pulkit Samrat where they communicate with their eyes. Hilarious and romantic moments at the same time. Also,though  Pankaj Tripathi's role seems too small to warrant an actor of his calibre, he of course, does well with what he has.Yet, with all that's going well for Fukrey, at 2.5+ hours, there is a lot that isn't. There isn't enough for you to warrant a trip to the theaters. Finally, I'll always remember Fukrey as the film that started with a guy peeing and cracking some toilet joke. Even so, a film in which the director and writer tried. A DVD watch where you can skip the first half sounds more like it.

Fukrey Returns had a chance to engage and entertain had it not been for its episodic, often nauseating, slapsticky humour.","A story-building game kids play at parties, has one person start a story with one line. Each child has to add a line to the story in turn. The story takes direction according to the imagination of the group. It is a lot of fun and often an entertaining, engaging story comes of it. Fukrey Returns is a film made out of one such story. The overall story is interesting and amusing, but the details needed to make a kids’ party story into a film, are just not funny.So, from poison being sucked out of a snake-bitten butt to jokes about organ trafficking to laughing at someone because they are dark-skinned to objectifying women – Fukrey takes a shot at anything that might get kids at a party to laugh. This is unfortunate considering the overall plot of these four good-for-nothings finding themselves in a soup caused by an underworld don is quite refreshing, especially in the logicless slapstick genre. The back and forth, the out-smarting and the double-crossing are disconnected and episodic. Yet, they could have worked if the connecting fibre wasn’t juvenile humor.   Sure, some of the humour comes through to make you smile at the silliness of it all. But, it is out of pity – for the makers, actors and the audience.The biggest losers in this venture are the actors. For each one of them, is quite capable. That they get the timing right is of no consequence when it is an unfunny quip or scene. Their talent is exploited by making them repetitive. Also, Ali Fazal and Manjot Singh are redundant. In terms of both quantity and quality, their roles are as dispensable, as those of Vishakha Singh and Priya Anand, are gratuitous. Altogether these four characters are a little more relevant to the plot than the item number and significantly less relevant than the individual characters, ‘chungu mungu’, Richa Chadda’s henchmen, and the lioness and her cub.It is not that Fukrey Returns doesn’t evoke emotion. But, I am assuming disgust and boredom aren’t what they were going for.

311,409,409,409,409,G. I. Joe: Retaliation,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/gi-joe-retaliation-review/,,,,2.766666667,"Non-stop action, not particularly fun, dominates the latest G. I. Joe film, one that’s hard to take seriously. G. I. Joe: Retaliation offers nothing new, and can even get tiring because of its rapid pace that is an aural and visual assault on the viewer.","The sequel to the 2009 film G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, G. I. Joe: Retaliation pretty much picks up from where the previous film left off. This time though, a number of new characters join some of the old to continue the battle, not just against the Joes’ sworn enemy, the organization known as Cobra, but also a threat from within the US Government itself. A film that makes last week’s Olympus Has Fallen look like Citizen Kane, the film is not much more than a continuous series of implausible situations and action set pieces that will mostly numb you of your sensory abilities for some time, post the film.Now, expecting logic in a G. I. Joe film is like expecting more than cow-dung from a Sajid Khan film, but what really makes it worse is that the one big draw the film had – the largest face on the posters of the film, that of Bruce Willis - is such a huge disappointment because he is hardly there in it. He breezily aces the scenes he’s in, no doubt, but it so leaves you wanting for more. The rest of the film is largely exhausting and quite predictable, both in terms of plot as well as execution.When the President of the United States sends the G. I. Joe team on a tactical operation in Pakistan, things go awry, as the entire team is annihilated, save for Roadblock, Flint and Lady Jaye (none of whom appeared in the first film). What’s worse, the entire G. I. Joe outfit has been branded as traitors. It is up to the survivors to erase the blot on the name of their dead compatriots, and to hunt down the people responsible for the deception.What I have always failed to understand with these big Hollywood action extravaganzas is how the writers and directors don’t seem to feel the need to pace the film right, to give it a graph that will draw the audience in and make them feel the rise and fall in emotions, even if it is purely exhilaration from action than any real feelings towards the characters. The film maintains a breathless pace throughout, rarely taking its foot off the action pedal. The result is a film that becomes repetitive and tiresome after a while.Also, though this could be purely subjective because of a certain image in my mind, it seemed that director Jon M. Chu is not quite up to directing large-scale action films. (Jon M. Chu directed the last two Step Up films.) Even in a film whose very foundation is suspension of disbelief, action can only truly work if the viewer can make sense of it. Retaliation’s sequences are massively mounted and some of them are actually imaginative in vision, but shoddily executed, relying on fast-moving objects and rapid cuts that distract viewers rather than involve them.It doesn’t help that they only seem to want to cast non-actors in G. I. Joe films. Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock has a likeable presence but that’s about it. No one else comes even close to making any sort of impact, unless one counts the scenes where Adrianne Palicki, who plays Lady Jaye, wears clothes meant to show off her, let’s say, feminine side. The big disappointment, one I still can’t get over considering how large his face was splashed in the promotions of the film, was the tiny role offered to Bruce Willis. Here’s a man who knows how to kick backsides on screen, so why not use it to the full?The film does make slightly better use of 3D than most films have so far. Largely subtle, with the odd shots of shrapnel and even people flying directly at you, the 3D doesn’t jar as much as it usually tends to. Still, I think it is about time Hollywood figures out that 3D isn’t something that really excites viewers enough to want to pay a premium and then dim your vision for it. Not as torturous as the last Die Hard film but still nowhere close to being an exciting action film, G. I. Joe: Retaliation is really only for hardcore and exclusive action film fans. But for those like me who’ve grown up with G. I. Joe action figures and WWE, each of us has made far better action films in our heads, starring our plastic playmates, and you’re always disappointed that Dwayne Johnson doesn’t go Rock Bottom-ing and People’s Elbow-ing the bad guys.

It reaches your gut and you want to do something yourself. Gabbar Is Back is one of those solutions. It addresses the wrong with anarchy. Interestingly, it acknowledges that anarchy is not the solution. Unfortunately it takes the same route that almost all films that take up the issue do, complete with preachiness. Funnily enough, goes ahead to say, “my way might not be the best, but you ought to do better”. However, it just touch a nerve for a bit before going all “holier than thou” on you. Many a film have addressed corruption top to bottom and back to the top. This one hits a sweet spot by including malpractice in the private sector. Along with the bureaucrats, politicians, and law and order . Gabbar is Back takes on the misuse of power held by doctors and hospitals when a near one is unwell. Other than this one plot point the rest of Gabbar Is Back is as run-of-the-mill as it gets. Despite the fact that our protagonist is being hunted down by the police and villain alike, the plot doesn't quite thicken. Some of the dialogue is powerful and/or insightful and makes you want it to register well. Also, there is a subtle satire when corrupt officials are motivated into coming out to show really how corrupt they are. But, just when you think the film is actually being smart, you realise the film knows it and doesn't want the audience to miss out on it. So, it decides to make sure you get the point. It shows it, explains it, describes it and underlines it.  Given these circumstances,  there is only so much for the actors to do. The hero is wronged, angry, and smart. And because he is Akshay Kumar, he is also a one man army when it comes to the action sequences. The lead lady is as instrumental in the plot as you'd expect her to be. Shruti Haasan is annoying for the little part that she gets. But, you can hardly blame her for a role written so that she gets to change costumes and have a couple of songs picturised on her. Speaking of which, an actress of Chitrangada Singh's caliber is now doing item numbers – there is something very wrong with this picture - well beyond having a song that objectifies women just because that's a way to sell the film. Even beyond the fact that the makers are clearly not confident about their product by itself.

A loud and tacky story with more distractions than the story itself makes a decent idea, with a common man behaving like a common man, ineffective.","In stories where the common man is wronged, I've always wondered, why no one tries anything other than the common man's frustration with the system getting to him near interval or a little later? What if he succumbed to corruption, power-goons , etc throughout the film - because that would actually be close to reality, right? Common man is a common man, no Singham or even Dr. Anand? Besides, I had begun to get a tad bored with the typical improbable and pseudo-inspiration, notwithstanding the few well-made ones. The answer is a Gali Gali Chor Hai. If you don't have the inspiring lead character, you'll supposedly need loud side characters, a haywire plot that attempts satire, and a more-or-less boring story despite a decent central idea. Bharat (Akshaye Khanna) is the common man in question, who crosses a goon-of-a-politician to get stuck in a rigmarole, that starts with a threat from a police constable that he'll be taken into custody, because a thief reported that he stole a table fan from Bharat's house. Yes, you read that right. Just in case, you didn't see subtlety being thrown out of the window with the name Bharat, you will see irrelevant, loud and tacky characters do the do. Not to mention the three 'Of course's and one 'what the...!?' I could've put in that one-line synopsis. Gali Gali Chor Hai is just that kind of a film. Exaggeration under the guise of satire is used to make a point and beats the purpose by distracting from the point itself. Sure, some of my sentiments as this country's common woman are echoed, but the impact is short-lived. And there is the obvious, in-your-face parallel with the Ram Leela sequences, but again the manner in which they are edited into the main story mar the effectiveness. The side-story of Bharat, his suspicious wife, Nisha (Shriya Saran) and their paying guest, Amita (Mugdha Godse) are as distracting as the over-acting by most of the cast is. What was the purpose of this diversion from the main story? - is an entirely different question. My only guess is that they were trying to run a parallel between the ironies of how national and domestic systems run. Yes, I laughed at  my thought and am giving you a chance too. The gamut of other bit roles performed by Annu Kapoor, Vijay Raaz, Satish Kaushik, Akhilendra Mishra, Murli Mishra and Amit Mistry all have potential to be interesting but stay half-exposed. Throw in the mandatory item number, love song and one on social activism with no real rhyme or reason and you have a perfectly ignorable film. Tch! I do feel like applauding what director, Rumy Jaffery and writer, Mumukshu Mudgal have tried here. It is indeed courageous to have central character that surrenders more easily than he combats. But, everything other than that is a little too overbearing and takes improbability and pseudo-inspiration associated with common man stories to the other extreme. Gali Gali Chor Hai made me prefer the other kind of fake.

Aimed at showcasing different types of corrupt politicians, might have led to an even lower voter turnout.","Though the title sounds absolutely ridiculous it is filled with sarcasm for local politicians. The politicians who exercise control in their constituency only to succumb to the higher powers at the center. This mixed with humor and good dialogues had definite potential for both entertainment and hitting home a point. Instead we have an extremely annoying set of similarly corrupt politicians who seem to be fighting aimlessly.Then there’s this smart alec Narayan Rao who is supposedly clean-hearted but you are never sure of his true motivations. It is left hanging loose. Vague intentions have a charm of their own but only if it is so intentionally. Ambiguity that seems inadvertent is tasteless and thus very irritating. Who is doing what and why is rather episodic and has no connection with previous incidents. This chaotic behavior of characters becomes even more abrupt with the anecdotal type of jokes. The satire in the gags is worth a few smiles but does nothing at all to give a semblance of flow from one plot to another. Not to mention that the subplots are very randomly sewn together. And the performances include the usual bunch of sketchy characters having a yell-louder-than-me-if-you-can contest. Having said all of that there is still an attempt to comment on the sad state of our power-holders. However stereotypical, there’s an attempt to show how disinterested voters and party workers are in the affairs of the country. They need nothing more than a fair-skinned member of the fairer gender perform a folk dance to shift their loyalties. Yet, ultimately it is a very flat narrative filled to the brim with mayhem and inconsequential sub-plots. The potential that the name of the film has starts and finishes right there.

One which makes you sit on the edge of your seat and bite, whatever is left of, your nails from the cricket matches. It's none of that and more. It's sluggish and I have quite a few nasty things to say about its 'style'.","We are grade 'A' fools, who aren't at all exposed to any kind of cinema other than the one dished out in the name of 'style' and 'thrill'. We don't watch the umpteen Television series from around the world from our couch, so we don't know what the very basics of a murder mystery. Yes, I'm furious. What are we in the eyes of our filmmakers? Deprived souls who have to be thankful for whatever we get?Maybe I wouldn't have been this irked if they had fulfilled at least one of the things they set out to achieve - style or substance. The story has zilch in terms of drama or suspense. No, pausing before every word of every dialogue doesn't fulfill that need to be nervous about what's going to happen next. If you make me hang for every word you say, literally, I will doze off. The style is largely superficial too. Even if you disregard the fact that there's nothing you haven't seen earlier. Unless the last you saw a Hindi film was 15 years ago, then the style might hold something for you. But then again, I'd recommend the film directed by the person who produced this film - Don.Geez, who'd have known that a day would come when I'd recommend a Shahrukh Khan film over an Abhishek Bachchan one. It was cool when Abhishek walked that lop-sided stylish walk or sat lounging heavy on one side, clad in white against a red backdrop. After the first time though it's called repetition and predictable. You got to give me something more interesting than that. Especially when the next in line to try and impress me is Kangna Ranaut trying to finish off her English lines in a hurry. Sheeeesh! Sorry for the break in flow, but I just can't get over on how much one can be blind to the banality of the basic plot! Not to mention that whatever Abhishek's character does is a tangent to the main plot. And the writer's confusion is transparent - should I focus on the main plot or should I make the sub-plot bigger so we can offer it to a mainstream actor. You know what, I ""shhuushed"" the guy sitting next to me in the first hour because he kept saying, ""what a bore yaar!""

316,414,414,414,414,Gandhi my father,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewNotepad18 Critic Reviews 3.3/5.0 5 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/gandhi-my-father-review/,3.3/5.0,5/5.0,,3.166666667,"The movie is supposed to be about Harilal Mohandas Gandhi but ends up becoming about Gandhiji and India's freedom struggle. Though the audience is denied insight into the minds of the characters, they are given some brilliant performances by the lead cast.","The title, the promotional previews, and the other media publicity all give the impression that this movie is about Gandhi Jr., Harilal, and his struggle with being under the shadow of such a dynamic father.  But, at the end of it all, it comes across as a tool to sensitize the country to the fact that Gandhiji made many more sacrifices than meets the eye. Yet another movie from Gandhiji's point of view. The emotional trauma of Harilal, Baa and the rest of the family is side-lined. The experience feels incomplete.The movie starts out brilliantly. I was truly intrigued by the way we see Gandhiji as a father. You could see the human element instead of the usual demi-god status that this simple man is accorded. The parent-child problem felt so real because it was so much like any other parent-child problem - diverse expectations, disappointment in both directions, and the inevitable frustration. It really threw light on a totally different aspect of Gandhiji. Alas, the cookie crumbles. And the director could not maintain this tension past the first half hour. Soon enough, Gandhiji is put back on the pedestal. And the movie becomes a documentation of the history of our independence. A snippet of what Gandhiji was doing at that time, and another of what Harilal was doing at that time - literally alternating rhythmically. This also gives the movie a very choppy feel. Scenes just cut into each other under the guise of fade-ins and fade-outs rather than flowing with the narrative. It's the actors that make this worth a watch. You could feel Gandhiji's inclination towards his aspirations for the country while feeling responsibility towards his family. Darshan Jariwala has done great justice to portray the various shades of Gandhiji's personality - calm, preachy, upset, firm, ambitious, etc. I usually don't care for weak, loser-type characters in stories. But, Akshaye Khanna makes you feel for the nervous, diffident, eager-to-please Harilal who has a huge image to live up to. You can sense the pressure the son faces - wanting to impress his father but fortunately or unfortunately discovering that he has a mind and ambitions of his own. Shefali Shah, as usual, leaves you spell-bound. One look at her and you can imagine what Baa must have been going through at that time. Her make-up person needs special mention - each wrinkle seemed to have received minute attention. And I cannot forget Bhumika Chawla's expressions of frustration and helplessness, though she had very little time on the screen. I found the background settings extremely distracting. For a movie set in the early-mid 20th century, and for a not-so-bright subject matter, the colors seemed too bright and the objects in the background too new. These things took away from the drama that could have been created. Also, clichéd use of rain to demonstrate pathos in the life of the characters was too in-the face. The solemn background music could not do much to retain the drama given the cheerful visuals. Of course, it could be argued that colors of our walls do not change according to whether we are happy or sad, but a freshly painted wall in the room of a person who doesn't have enough to feed his family, just doesn't gel. My main complaint though remains that we are not allowed entry into the minds of the characters. A huffy-puffy Harilal is not enough to convey his frustration. His motivations are never explained. Or for that matter, Gandhiji's justifications for his decisions were not clarified either. Even if we do give the benefit of doubt that such information might not be available, the question remains - why make a movie about relationships without knowing the rationale behind the characters' behavior? I set out to see what being a son to the father of our nation was like. I came out with glimpses of their relationship and a whole lot of unanswered questions. Fortunately, I also came out with some fine performances by the entire cast. Which is enough to keep the movie from being a complete disappointment.

Sure, if you sit through almost two hours and you could attempt to appreciate what the film might be trying to do.

Yet, let's say we let that go. And it does become easier to let it go, with the distorted narrative, hotchpotch editing, and convoluted connections in the story. Gandhi To Hitler is set between 1939 and 1945. I guess it tries to display the devastation of Hitler's reign.

The umpteen voiceovers, text superimposes, the stock footage, the grainy and sepia texture all made Gandhi To Hitler look and feel like a documentary. How I wish, it was a well-made, adequately-researched, thoroughly-thought-out documentary. Gandhi's track was almost 100% voiceover. Hitler's track had too many people with a layer of thick, visibly bad, make-up. Not to mention costumes in this period drama that most likely didn't belong to the period. I'm no expert, but crisp, cotton, chickenkari dresses (for the children) looked out-of-place in Germany of the 1940s. And Balbir's track - if I don't feel empathy when Indian soldiers are being shot at, and they are in an awful situation for no fault of theirs, what has the film achieved? Are we sure the main reason for this track was not to elongate the run-time and make room for some lip-sync song-and-dance routines? And pushing itself forward to seek your attention is a fourth track - the background score. It had an agenda of its own. I couldn't figure what it was though. That is exactly what Gandhi To Hitler felt like. A deliberate or even desperate trial at joining the dots between whatever little we know about the last few months of Hitler's life. A forced attempt at making a connection between Gandhi and Hitler. An aimless account in the endeavor to be ""different"".I feel sad for the writer and the director.

319,417,417,417,417,Gangoobai,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/gangoobai-review/,,5/5.0,,5.6,"Produced by NFDC and written, directed & edited by Priya Krishnaswamy, Gangoobai is film that has some genuine emotions at its core. However, the film in itself struggles to make its point. It tries more than a tad too hard to make you feel for the central character. Some poorly written characters and situations, mediocre performances make things worse for this film that is also weak technically. ","There is no easier way to say this, so I’m just going to say it; I was extremely disappointed with Gangoobai. An NFDC-produced film, made on a script that was an NFDC Screenwriters’ Lab selection in 2009 and developed further thereon, I expected it to be extremely strong at least on the script level. There is no denying that the film has heart and soul. It talks about hope and what it means for a human being, about how materialistic life has become today and about how human spirit still has the power to triumph over the greatest of travails. However, the film suffers from writing that can only be described as naïve. The film follows the journey of an aging bai (maid-servant) who lives in sylvan Matheran, a hill-station not far from Mumbai. In the course of her work, she chances upon something that entices her heart beyond limits of rationality. Spurred by a burning desire to possess it, she toils hard for four years before managing to accumulate enough money to buy it. Then, she sets on a journey to Mumbai to purchase the said item, expecting to return within a day. However, the journey doesn’t quite go as planned. As I mentioned earlier, the naivety of the film’s writing is something that I still can’t get over. The attempt to evoke emotions with regard to Gangoobai is so evident that it often feels manipulative. The film doesn’t try and tug at your heartstrings; it tries to manhandle them. Also, every single character in the film is far-fetched; there isn’t a hint of realism to their actions, their words or their reactions to Gangoobai. No matter how they seem on the exterior, the manner in which they instantly treat Gangoobai like the centre of the world continuously rings false. Gangoobai herself seems to have only one defect – her obsessive behaviour regarding possessing something that she doesn’t really need. Apart from that, she is the perfect human being - hardworking, resourceful, talented, open-minded, intelligent, charming and many more qualities that make her exceedingly loveable. Cute, really, but distinctly unreal. The only realism comes from some of the tiny side characters - a rich Sindhi woman who believes in unquestionable superiority and an obsessive boyfriend who doesn’t respect his celebrity girlfriend’s work. Sadly, they don’t really have much to contribute to the film any way.The film also suffers technically - inconsistent lighting, poor framing and choppy editing keep rearing their heads through the film. The bland background score does nothing to help it. Also, I was consistently bothered by the strange mix of Marathi and Hindi that the characters speak through the film. Why would two Maharashtrians switch to Hindi mid-sentence? Why would a non-Maharashtrian attempt to speak in Marathi with a character who very clearly understands Hindi? Yes, real life in India is multi-lingual, but there should be a certain use of logic to determine which language a character will speak and when. Of the cast, only veteran actress Sarita Joshi in the title role does any justice to her character. She has clearly worked hard on the character, and she often manages to elicit a smile. Purab Kohli’s turn as a love-struck middle-class man appeals in bits, but is inconsistent. Mita Vashisht is endearing, but her performance strikes many a false note. Raj Zutshi as the fashion designer is over-the-top, but when is he not? Nidhi Sunil as the supermodel with a heart of gold struggles with her part.
The film has been written, directed and edited by Priya Krishnaswamy – the film is quite literally her baby. While I’d laud her for the emotions that form the foundation of the film, I’d also have to be honest and say that the film rarely, if ever, rises above mediocrity in any department. I’d still go to watch her next film because she is certainly a brave director for choosing to make the kind of film she has. I’d also urge those who have a financial stake in cinema – producers and audiences – to support films like Gangoobai. But Gangoobai as a film in itself is not really a must-watch.

Yet, it is quite literally incomplete. Powerful performances and rustic visuals and sounds make the film worth a watch just by themselves. ","'Whacky' - every frame of Gangs of Wasseypur reeks of it. Imagine that in film set in the interiors of Jharkhand. The language, the characters, the dynamics of their relationship with each other, the songs that play in the background all add to the rugged, earthy feeling of the film. An experience very few directors in India can provide. Yet, it is not self-sufficient. As a story the experience is incomplete because we know we have watched only half a film. There's more to come and what we saw so far is not a film that stands alone. Much like its characters, Wasseypur has been pushed from here to there at hands of destiny and the world has been very matter-of-factly about it. In typical documentary tone you are told how Wasseypur has moved from Bengal to Bihar to now Jharkhand over 40-odd years. It is almost ironical when the voice behind that tone, Piyush Mishra is consoling a woman whose husband has cheated on her comment on her destiny. Many a time it does come across as a docu-drama that Anurag Kashyap wants to use to document the messed up system that most of India lived in since independence. Gangs of Wasseypur is a story Wasseypur's story, where Wasseypur itself represents the many small towns in this country that suffer at the hands of politicians and goons. You can't even call it the underworld because the perpetrators are so blatant about the fear they want to induce with their power.  At the same time, humor is infused and character of the film is built with time references to various films along the way. Almost as a pointer to the Bollywood-centric theme that part II is promised to have. While Gangs of Wasseypur touts itself as a revenge saga, you will realize it is a lot more. An anti-hero as a protagonist who finds it difficult to go without sexual release. He almost always comes across as the underdog because of the situations that he gets himself into and often he looks like he is making a fool of himself. Yet he is tender at heart for the people he really cares about. The dry humor used only adds to that judgement. You can't but wonder how his experiences as a son might have changed the equation with his sons. Strong women who aren't lead ladies by Hindi film standards - they are proud of how brutally the men of their lives use power against the entire world (except for them), a staunch friend, a few double crossers, sons who find it difficult to get out of their dad's shadow even though they hate him, all don’t let Gangs of Wasseypur remain a standard revenge saga.Yes, it is violent. Yes, it does try to make the same ol' point that revenge films have always tried - that it is futile because too many people on all sides die too gory a death. But Gangs of Wasseypur goes beyond that, it has characters who represent dissent - to them truce is not an option, never. Very few 'gang war' films allow room to those people who were bruised so bad that they cannot forgive. Also you see that exiting the trade is not an option. Even if a goon wants to mend his ways, if he is high profile enough, whatever business he gets into will invite unhealthy attention from rivals. To single out any one or two actors as being good at their job might imply that the others weren't as good and that woul be plain wrong. And what about the other stars of the film - the outstanding music, the way each film uses natural sources of light and keeps artificial ones at minimum, the fairly simple but amazingly perfect composition of frames, the three or four times slow-motion is used, especially in the last scene, the background score that becomes outright crazy given the context it is used in. No review would be complete without mentioning these heroes.Gangs of Wasseypur may demand patience from some of the viewers, but I enjoyed the pace and the time it took to settle down. It's like reading beautiful prose, whether or not you like what is written, you admire the way it is written. More often than not, you find yourself wondering if this is India's very own Godfather. Yet, it doesn't take away from the nagging incomplete feeling. Though what it also means is you are asking for the more you have been promised with utmost eagerness. Ps. What is it about use of abusive language in films that makes young adult males giggle like teenage girls?

A saga which holds no bars and lets loose the internal animal which revenge itself seems to have given birth to. A saga so full of characters that a keen film-lover would want to watch twice – only if they can stomach the violence in almost every frame and profanity in every other sentence. Others, shouldn't even bother.","Disclaimer: This review assumes you have watched part I. It might contain comments that refer to event of the previous film.A movie that uses a strong, scheming woman, who has very little to do in the rest of the film, as bookends  - almost as if she was given the honor of holding the story together. A movie that uses humor provided by a local brass band singer as a leitmotif to mark all significant events – morose or celebratory. Gangs of Wasseypur II is a movie that engages you in its quirkiness because that quirkiness still has bearings with what is real. A fusion of sorts between grit of a village in Jharkhand and pulp-film style whackiness. Gangs of Wasseypur II is as much about these seemingly insignificant characters as it is about its revenge-driven protagonists and the looming theme of the futility of violence. The smaller characters add flavor and ambiance to the brutal environment they are trying to thrive in. The main players of Wasseypur, Faisal (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) and Ramadhir Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia) keep you wondering about their next move. We know their motivations, yet we are unsure if and when they will strike. It is macho to the core. The women too have an undying fire in the belly. Though they don't take matters in their own hands, but they surely don't stress over sending their sons to war. The ruthlessness in the violence is just something else. Some scenes are so gruesome as if compensating for the few that didn't feature violence. Yet, none of it seems misplaced or overdone. A character who has gone through what he has gone through, with those motivations is bound to react with that ferocity. Only that, almost all characters share the same love for hardcore violence, so a viewer who has reservations against blood and gore might do well outside the theater. For others, though it is a release for the latent anger, vicarious as it may be.So much so that, every time someone from Ramadhir Singh's gang is killed, you can sense the success in the audience. The bigger the player taken down, the stronger the sense of victory. Which is amusing too. Because the good guys aren't really good either, right? They are murderers, black marketeers, and brutal ones too. A doped-out good-for-nothing son of a goon, turns into a goon. So?What is it then that the audience is rooting for? This question bothered me quite a bit because I knew not why I am rooting for these barbarous slayers. And the slight difference emerged - their motivations. The loyalty of the Khans to their main purpose versus the political and convoluted reasons of Singh's men. In fact, Faisal is even caught introspecting on why and how he got dragged into it all. He reflects on his personal dreams. And this is where all the Bollywood references fit in. As amusing as they might seem, they point at the unachieved dreams of the masses. Moments and situations like these and the grounded feeling the whole film carries is what make me ignore the two main grouses I have against Gangs of Wasseypur II. The choice of narration – it reads like a book, chapter-wise, without smooth flow. If it weren't for Piyush Mishra's voice and tone, the voice-over would seem never-ending. It felt like the story was in constant exposition, especially when the voice-over continues the second half. That new characters and themes are still being introduced post-interval didn't help either. The other complaint goes with my complaint against part 1 – it is not a stand alone film. I would have much rather seen the two parts as one and enjoyed it as one story. By watching it in two parts, both films feel incomplete. But, I guess commercial needs take precedence over my preferences. :) Otherwise the film leaves no room for complaint. Once again to name one actor as having done exemplary work would be unfair. The women in Anurag Kashyap films always stand-out. Not only for the character accorded to them and their strength but also for the unique sensuality he has them bring out. Similarly, to say an Anurag Kashyap film had awesome lighting, camerawork, sound, background score would be making a redundant statement. Also, something about the way Anurag Kashyap uses his music keeps you involved. Many a time, it makes very little sense (at least on first watch) but I still enjoy it. And for that I love it – making me enjoy something I don't understand. Does it glorify violence? Maybe. It uses it brilliantly for sure, especially to bring the narrative to crescendo in the climax. Maybe, it exhibits the vanity of violence by using it paradoxically. If a gang-war film needs to be made, this is the way to do it. Else of course, we watch Godfather, Pulp fiction, read the Mahabharata. But hey, why not try all three-in-one. Oh actually, make that three-in-two. But like anything that is a combination, it won't compare favorably to any one of those by itself. But is a whole that is more than the sum of its parts.

I happened to catch Gangster Squad on DVD and here's an update on the DVD features.Packed in an unassuming case, the single dual-layer disc that holds the film as well as its solitary ‘Special Feature’, the DVD of Gangster Squad doesn’t make for a collectible in any way. A film that was panned by most critics, but one that I found to be a brisk watch even the second time round, Ruben Fleischer’s period gangster noir flick is quite simply about the coolth of it. Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling and Sean Penn hold their own, and the film has a nice post-war LA feel, right down to tiny details, that quite appealed to me. The film on DVD is darker than I remember it being on the big screen, and it killed some of the beautiful shadows that stood out in the big screen watch. The true disappointment, of course, is the poor excuse for a ‘Special Feature’. A 4 minute-42 second featurette called ‘Tough Guys With Style’, it is pretty much a ‘Making Of’, one that has no substance in it whatsoever. It just has a few lines from key cast and crew about the whys & hows of the look-and-feel of the film; it amounts to nothing at all. Expectedly, the DVD also has 5.1 Dolby Digital sound as well as subtitles, in English and a number of foreign languages. And for those who have DVD players/drives with limited number of Region changes available, you must know that the Gangster Squad DVD is in Region 2. While I don’t recommend the DVD of the film, the film itself will always be one of those where I disagreed a bit with the general negative opinion. Most hated it, whereas I didn’t quite mind it, primarily because of the period feel and the cast.A film that was heavily delayed because of the Aurora shootings – it underwent considerable reshoot in the wake of the incident – Ruben Fleischer’s Gangster Squad finally hits theatres this week. A pity, since January is usually considered the worst month to release movies the world over. Gangster Squad is the first new film I’ve watched on the big screen in 2013, and though it isn’t a great film by miles, I’d still like to believe that 2013 at the movies is off to a decent, even if a slightly stuttering, start.Welcome to post-World War II Los Angeles, a place where even shadows ooze glamour; where three-piece suit and Fedora wearing gangsters rule the roost, the law be damned. And East Coast don Mickey Cohen is laying the groundwork for his domination of the ‘Wild West’, ousting the existing crime lords in the city. Enter an upright, tough-as-nails cop John O’Mara, whose only aim is to make LA a safe place to live again, for his child to grow up in. When it looks like Cohen just cannot be stopped, O’Mara is entrusted with the responsibility of forming a small extra-judicial team to take care of matters in whatever way they deem fit.With a plot like that, supposedly based on a true story, and the kind of cast that this film has, it is hard to not make a film that entertains. Add to that the manner in which the makers manage to get the period feel right - Plymouths, Tommy Guns, glamorous bars with neon lights, the works – and what you end up with is a fun couple of hours at the movies. The action scenes are effortlessly cool; some of the scenes are virtually orgies of booming gunshots. There is even one superbly shot chase sequence involving cars that were not really meant for chase sequences. The film is helped immensely by the cinematography and VFX. A majority of the film is shot at night, so there is generous play of lights. The manner in which the light supposedly caused by gunshots is used to light scenes and shots is particularly interesting. The use of the background score is excellent as well. The instruments and orchestral feel go well with the period and the tone of the film.But what truly keeps the film interesting is the cast. Sean Penn steals the show as Mickey Cohen; he injects the character with an electric quality, breathing unapologetic malice and pretending to have a sense of humour even when he does not. Josh Brolin is superb as the honest, posterior-pounding Sgt. John O’Mara. Ryan Gosling, easily one of the most exciting young Hollywood actors at the moment, seems to be having a whole lot of fun as the icy cool cop who falls in love with the most dangerous girl he could find. His body language is what makes him stand out as an actor. Watch as he casually leans against a wall in the midst of a messy fight scene; he keeps reminding you why he is an actor to watch out for. The supporting cast does a great job as well. Robert Patrick and Giovanni Ribisi, who play members of Brolin’s team, are excellent. Emma Stone as Cohen’s moll looks great, but has a small part in what is essentially a film about the men.As usual, the film’s biggest problem is the heavily flawed writing. The screenplay is riddled with flaws and leaps of faith, too many to count actually. The manner in which Gosling’s character agrees to be a part of the team, the way in which the Gangster Squad gets hold of their information about Cohen, the ridiculously skewed ratio of bullets fired to bullets finding their mark, these and a whole lot more require large doses of what we as the audience have come to dislike - looking the other way. In fact, the writing of the film is what truly pulls it down, ensuring that it never becomes memorable at any stage.Gangster Squad is a forgettable film, one that you wont be thinking about for too long once it is done. But there is good chance that you’ll have some amount of fun while watching it; it has enough ingredients for that much at least. If, like me, you believe that the only real way to watch a movie is on the big screen, then go for it. There’s a good chance you’ll be entertained during its run time. Otherwise, the film will just as well make for a one-time watch on DVD. Then, I’d strongly recommend those who like this film to go on to catch L.A. Confidential, my personal favourite LA noir film by some distance.

324,422,422,422,422,Gauri The Unborn,Switch channels if it's on cable,wogma reviewNotepad6 Critic Reviews 0.4/5.0,/movie/gauri-the-unborn-review/,0.4/5.0,,,5.2,Horror meets a social message to make a disastrous movie,"I don't remember the last time someone's strong opinion was shoved so vehemently down my throat using a medium of mass communication. Maybe I was agitated because I have a strong opinion which is diametrically opposite to the one expressed in Gauri - the unborn.  But the point is that even if you were anti-abortion, I doubt you would enjoy it. Because it is badly made too.An otherwise fine actor, Atul Kulkarni, overacts. Rituparna Sengupta's dubbing was so bad and distracting, that it was difficult to focus on her performance. And close-ups of her awfully made-up face didn't help either. So, if you were inclined to shut your ears and eyes every time she's on screen, well...there's not much left. Baby Rushita has given a decent performance, but I can't help feeling bad for her. In this day and age, where parents mull over introducing adult topics to children at the right age, should a child even be allowed to play the spirit of an unborn child? Let alone lecture and emotionally blackmail adults who choose abortion. (I am not giving the movie away any more than the marketing department, because the movie posters say this in so many words).Given these factors, it matters little that the camerawork and background score are just about alright for a movie of this genre. On the other hand, the visual effects were pretty lame. Granted, it is a low budget movie, but then therein lies the creativity, right? To make a presentable product from the limited resources. The least they could do was give the child a lovable character so that the target audience would want to reconsider their decision on abortion. Especially when you are trying to convince people that abortion is evil. People of a nation most of whose problems can be narrowed down to the population explosion.

But, put together it becomes just about average.","For a film that starts with slapsticky toilet humor, A Gentleman recovers quickly with a couple good laughs, a tolerable-cute romance, and some slick action. Unfortunately, it goes back to regular action masala post-interval and loses the little charm it creates in the first hour. It was a pleasant surprise to see the writers tease the audience into saying “baah! predictable” and peek-a-booing a “gotchya!” There are some good action scenes too. I especially enjoyed the parking lot and shopping aisle scenes. There is a little honesty in the romance too. Interestingly, this romance felt relatively germane to the story compared to some of the cool stunts that were for the sake of cool action. After a bit, it truly became fitting in fights because they made the film look slick rather than being an integral part of the story.The story itself was weaved together in a very 90s-like fashion where all elements of entertainment are put together – comedy, romance, action – with each of these doing their bit in keeping you engaged. But, as a whole it loses steam. Interestingly again, a film full of any of these elements wouldn't have worked together either. They were entertaining in that dosage only. Anything more and it would drag. That points to the inherent weakness of not being able to convert an interesting-sounding core idea into a full-fledged feature length film. If any of these departments were strong by themselves, one wouldn't need the other elements as fillers. And even so, for a film that wants to showcase it's action and masala, A Gentleman does relatively well with its attempt at story.             Siddharth Malhotra does reasonably well as both Gaurav and Rishi. He has his own style of merging with his surrounding, whethere it is a dreary office meeting or a covert spy operation. This unfortunately, could also mean that if he doesn't evolve, he will loose screen presence. To elaborate, in the scenes with Jacqueline Fernandez, or for that matter even Hussain Dalal, they own the screen. And while Dalal is doing a good job of keeping a smile on your face, Fernandez isn't even trying too hard. Her diction reminded me of dubbed English films. You cringe at her dialogue delivery just like you'd cringe when you hear Matthew McConaughey speaking in Hindi. It is sad that she is still taking on these roles whereas almost every actress of her stature is doing at least some films that don't use women as pretty props. Instead she picks a role that is as redundant as a woman in many a Hollywood action film.Well, at least they picked and executed the action pieces well. If only, only they were enough to recommend a trip to the theaters for you. In that sense, it is a step down for this writer-directer duo.

326,424,424,424,424,Get Smart,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/get-smart-review/,,,,2.7,,"Since this is first time I am guest posting out here I feel I probably should mention that I am extremely shallow. You will learn more as you read.Given the current fare running in the movie halls the past few months I was hoping for a release that would have me rolling in the aisles. Get Smart does not disappoint. In fact I think I should go back for a second screening since I don't think I did the movie justice with the amount I laughed the first time. There is only so much you can laugh before your sides start  protesting. The movie stars Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway. Two actors who never particularly interested me when I saw their initial movies. I saw Carell first in Evan Almighty. The only thing lower than my opinion of him was my opinion of that movie.I found Anne Hathaway plain even after the transformation in Princess Diaries because she had weird knees. All dislikes went out of the window with the string of movies that followed showing her in better light (and probably better make up). The loss of puppy fat and her sudden aversion towards clothes probably had a lot to do with my decision as well. The situation in the movie is not original. Carell's character, Max Smart holds a desk job at an Intelligence Agency and aspires to be a field agent. With typical insensitivity the agency keeps him chained to the desk. A security breach that compromises the identities of all their agents finally gives Max the chance he was waiting for. The cinematography is by the book. There are no experimentations or any alternative styles that have been adapted. Editing to the untrained eye is pretty smooth and this movie was never meant to have an arty angle. While transitions are pretty smooth, the action sequences might get a viewer to do double takes. Whether it was to save on costs or time or done with a specific purpose I guess we might never know but the high paced, fast take action sequences have been shot on a digital camera as opposed to a film camera that is utilized in the rest of the film. Or it might be just to mask the fact that neither Anne Hathaway nor Steve Carell have done any high flying action roles prior to this film and lacked the proper knowledge of executing them.What follows, of course, cannot be told without breaching this blog's central theme. Do prepare yourself for outrageous action and stunts. You won't have time to dwell on thinking how unrealistic any of them were since at this point your logic has stopped functioning. That's a good thing. On my hilarity scale it ranks pretty high. Euro Trip, Ice Age 1 & 2; Get Smart definitely follows that list.

327,425,425,425,425,Ghajini,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewNotepadPreview41 Critic Reviews 3.4/5.0 5 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/ghajini-review/,3.4/5.0,3/5.0,,3.2,That I didn't realize how my 3+ hours passed by is testimony to the fact that you can't take the love for masala out of this Indian. Even though I usually don't like this combination of spices I found myself enjoying most of Ghajini. The thriller succeeded in getting me anxious but the seasoning left a bad after-taste.,"A few frames into the movie and I knew I'd be wasting the 3 hours to come if I chose to connect the proceedings on the screen with Memento. So, I sent Memento out of the dark hall. I began adjusting myself to the loud chant-like background music which over-compensated for the sparse dialogue. And my eyes refocused as per the over-zealous camera-person/editor's demands. Once I gave in, I saw myself getting involved with the characters, getting curious, heart-beating in the throat and all.Ghajini is one of those movies which I liked despite sensing the flavor of 'over-the-top' cinema in each of the 185 minutes. It absorbed me in its present scene and yet left a garish after-taste. It's all packed in there - drama, emotion, romance, action, song, dance, and a social message thrown in for no charge. Mixing of more than 2 genres annoyed me here, as always, e.g. I felt completely lost when the romance cropped up. And just imagine the state of my mind when songs were thrown in like rabbits jump out of magic hats - from nowhere. While on that note, my heart bled when I heard Prasoon Joshi pull a Sameer, save a few verses. Since the songs were picturised and choreographed well, I vote for a separate music video album for those who are interested. Do you?Anyway, scene-by-scene Ghajini grew on me. While I wouldn't have enjoyed any one thread of the plot by itself, the total added up to a little more than the sum of the parts. The sequences that worked without any caveat were the two junctions where the thriller was poised such that anxiety of the protagonist's next step raised my pulse-rate. Not as badly as Aamir Khan's pulsating nerves at his temples though. Wide eyes wanting to scream louder than what his voice box can create. It's inexplicable why his character transformed into this unwieldy monster when angry. Almost as if to show this is what this Khan is capable of -physical shape included. And note that I haven't yet spoken against how his short-term memory turns him into a superhero with super-duper action-powers. Now that I've done it, I had a huge problem with all the so-called 'crowd pleasing', 'mass appeal' items added. Once again, I'm a part of the masses and one in the crowd and I don't want it! Oh well...However, Aamir mesmerized me with his subtle reflexes in the emotional and romantic sequences. And Asin very charmingly supported him and entertained the audience. Her occasionally-irritating saccharine character was endearing enough for me to wish for her happiness. Though all very white, it was a part written with a little more meat than usually accorded to women in Hindi cinema. On the other hand, Jiah Khan had a sketch of a role which she fumbled through as ungraciously as she could. Why were her urdu lessons being publicized? She could barely hide the accent while speaking English!Ghajini's nowhere as smart or nearly as subtle as Memento but it's not completely stupid either. It's not even a fraction as mind-boggling as Memento either, but it does keep your brain ticking fast enough to ignore the huge leaps of faith every 10th minute. Ghajini is certainly one of those that people who love the melodramatic elements of Hindi cinema will enjoy but those who hate masala will hate. And either you have to be one of those who hasn't watched Memento or can block memories of Memento to make the most out of this one. I combined my tolerance of all things Bolly and ignored the original to like it as much as I did.

It doesn't move forward and soon enough, gets repetitive and thus predictable.","The last thing you'd expect from a movie that had such an interesting trailer is that it wouldn't move ahead from there. You rejoice at 20 minutes when almost everything you knew about the story beforehand is covered and now there is two hours of fun to look forward to. And then nothing happens. If it weren't for some one-liners sprinkled through and a couple of decent performances, Ghanchakkar would've been a complete disappointment. The movie lingers too much. It stays with situations a little too long after the peak of the situation; the dialogue repeats itself a little more after it has made its impact; at many points the lines come a second or two too late. By then you are done and dusted with your prediction of what is going to happen and pretty much always you hit bull's eye. Including, the final twist. For the content it has, Ghanchakkar is a good 30-45 minutes too long.The only thing that keeps you going are a couple of the performances. Vidya Balan carries off her weight and ridiculous outfits with ease, as only she can. It is hilarious when her character, Neetu's sense of dressing is mocked at and she defends it with all pride. Even her weight is commented upon. However, her timing does go off in a couple of comic scenes and towards the end she is mostly shrieking. Her accent too inconsistent. Yet, every time she goes ""Hain?"" you just have to laugh. Namit Das as Idris has perfect timing for is one-liners. Unfortunately, he is handed some slapsticky sexual humor which doesn't quite work. Emraan Hashmi and Rajesh Sharma's roles don't need too much variation in their expressions and they stick to what is required of them. Also, the characters stay a good arm's distance away and you aren't really given a chance to get involved with the them.It gets insufferable after a while. There is only so much of Rajesh Sharma and Namit Das' shrugged-shoulder-laughter that you can find funny. There is only so much of - ""Where's the money?"" ""I don't remember. I've lost my memory."" ""Liar! I'll kill you/your wife."" - that you can take. The basic premise, where three guys loot a bank, and the one who is supposed to keep the money safe has supposedly lost his memory, is really interesting. But nothing is done with that.To spice it up they've added a few quirks like the goons using a local train compartment as rendezvous or a commuter carrying vegetables. But that's what they come across as - quirks that are forced in. They do not go with the flow of the film.  The Aamir-esque threatening caller on phone too doesn't add much fear. There was a possibility for a look into how the husband-wife relationship falls apart because of an illness and/or money, but that is dealt with rather superficially.This purported comic thriller never thrills and is funny only intermittently. Even if you don't compare it to the expectations that the promo material sets up, you'd end up disappointed with Ghanchakkar.

Characters being introduced seamlessly, story building up well. For once, I felt like the concept of how the story is told can really make an over-told story engaging. Alas, post-interval, the film nosedives faster than you can think.When I say it started well, it has a lot to do with what wasn't done. There were no typical voice-over type shortcuts; no extra emphasis on trying to explain the background. A little tacky with the mental-illness induced flashback and a few obvious lines that were there just so the audience knows what the characters already know. These were easily excusable considering the setup typical of a film like this was conspicuous by its absence. For example, when was the last time we had a villain who was aware of behavioral issues? When was the last time a child was applauded and the child reprimands her audience with “what's the big deal?” The performances too were quite restrained. I might be a tad more forgiving because I went in expecting a screaming Sunny Deol. Soha Ali Khan seems worn out but at least she is taking age in her stride. The villains, Narendra Jha and Abhilash Kumar play their parts as business tycoon and spoilt brat well. The four idealistic youngsters – Shivam Patil, Aanchal Munjal, Rishabh Arora and Daina Khan – are competent enough for you to be worried for them. However, the story writing doesn't support them in the second half. The film goes from being about the menace of the business-politic nexus to a personal story, rather abruptly. Also, all the focus on the main story, the long-long chase sequence is wrapped up all too quickly making you wonder what the fuss was all about. Speaking of which, the chase sequence (like the film) starts out engaging you completely making it a thriller worth its salt and then overstays its welcome. When the film ends though, you remember what you liked even though you are totally miffed with how it all ended. A lot of what you like has to do with what was avoided – like self-references, songs, romantic track and so on. Unfortunately, you can remember a film for what it is not, only so much.

But for the melodrama and the technical stuff that seems just too implausible.,"Whether or not it's true war story, The Ghazi Attack makes for a decent thriller. Once you have accepted all the technical jargon as true, that is. There is so much of the latter that believing the story is true becomes more and more difficult with every passing minute. Sure, sonar technology is mind-boggling and all the things shown might even be possible. There can still be no excuse for overt drama as the film progresses in a film that otherwise seemed to have been avoiding it. War films with an undercurrent of mutiny always make for interesting stories. Your sensitivity is hooked from the word go because you know which country your loyalties lie with. But you are debating what side to be on, in the mutiny. What makes a person become a soldier? You can't deny him his patriotism once he is on the field. Is it wrong then, for him to follow his passion – of slaying the enemy without provocation? But if soldier were to follow this passion of theirs, there would be mayhem. These are the philosophies you are struggling with as you see the war between discipline-orders vs. killer instinct with an agenda. This build-up is thoroughly engaging, even if the end is mighty predictable from the beginning. However, post-interval this gives way to melodrama that you would expect in a typical war film. That is disappointing at first and gets boring soon enough. Then, our beliefs in bravery and a human body's physical capacity are tested.The melodrama of course, seeps into the performances – from dialogue delivery to glistening eyes to exaggerated expressions. In a shot earlier in the film, for instance Atul Kulkarni is flustered between what he thinks might be right and what his commander (Kay Kay Menon) is commandeering. Without a line you know why Kulkarni is doing what he is doing. Come second half though, you see him lecture another officer in an extremely affected manner. The tone of the film sinks into the regular fare, from a controlled, nuanced clash of characters. Fortunately, the visual texture of the film stays the same. The film alternates between the murky blue, deep sea and the cringy, clanky, claustrophobic insides of a submarine without any respite. This makes the film stand out from the usual Hindi films and helps it stay true to what it wants to be – an uncomfortable, edgy watch. If only, the consistency in tone had stuck through the other departments of the film – especially the writing.

So, no horror. And no comedy either. Tch, what a waste! ","One of the first few lines in Ghost go, ""I'm a doctor. I have to behave responsibly, right?"" And this along with the typical texture that goes with a B-grade horror film, seal the deal as far as how good the film is going to be. And the case gives itself little chance to be re-opened.The little chance is afforded by the way in which spooks are created the first couple of times. Slimy insects and hardcore gore begin to do the do only to be rudely interrupted by special effects that make the images look like they are shot with a thermographic camera of some sort. I'm all game for filmmakers experimenting with techniques, but unfortunately this looked like a cop-out - a method in which they could avoid showing the implied gore. Or use of this technology was more feasible than the refined prosthetics skills that would be needed to pull it off. That could've made the film better in terms of number of genuine creeps provided. Unfortunately, the creeps come from cheesy dialogues in romantic situations like, ""Why are you so beautiful, Suhani?"" or ""I'll not forget you till I forget myself."" Incidentally, this is supposed to be a break from the 'intense' horror situations and thus the love affair is rhythmically interspersed with the core of the Ghost story. Usually this genre leave enough opportunities for the actors to scream, squeal and thus show their acting prowess. But Ghost's story doesn't have room for that because the lead pair barely every faces the spirit that's causing terror. Our man Shiney Ahuja has one break-down but that's about it. Sayali Bhagat has a few sequences to give a moderately scared expression and she quite firmly holds that one through most scenes - including the romance. Shiney Ahuja here.> 
Speaking of jokes, usually horror movies are associated with two kinds of laughter from the audience. One is kind that is at the film for trying to scare and the other is nervous laughter that comes right after a stand-alone spine-chilling scene. Ghost gives neither. 
It tries its bit of Christian symbolism with a character named Mary and frogs and locust-like insects, but the pace is so slow in many of the non-horror sequences that I could hardly be bothered to make sense of them. 
The only silver lining in this entire gamut of things that go wrong with Ghost is that it is directed by a woman. I don't think there are too many women have directed horror films. For what it's worth that needs to be applauded. And yet, I cannot recommend you to watch it even if you had nothing better to do.

Gippi doesn't make me repent despite not being the greatest films on adolescence. ,"Gippi or Gurpreet Kaur needs to be comfortable with who she is. But, for that one should know what one is, right? Gippi, the film, concerns itself with the struggles of the ordinary teen - the one who is just about average or even below average at academics, sports, popularity and so on. But this teenager could easily be any common person, and the school setting changes to the work or even family environment. Sure, Gippi is over-simplified, but the cute factor makes up for it. Set in Shimla, the film has a cozy, warm feel to it. To top it off, you have a chubby, cute character trying to make her place in the world or at least be okay with whatever place she has. You have additional layers of first love, sexuality, teenagers trying to cope with the changes in their bodies. The curiosity, the giggles make the characters and thus the film relatable. However, the nastiness that these kids pelt each other with seemed a little over-done, but then maybe that's how life for kids these days is. Also, for all the ""fun"" Gippi is made to say she is, the film would have been served better if there were some exposition to her fun side. Instead, we see a grumpy adolescent who is treated badly because she is fat. She is also called ugly, but that didn't come across either. Riya Vij is too cute to be called ugly, even in fiction.Yet, its her performance that keeps you hooked through. Her innocence reaches out to you. She uses her eyes very well to convey that her genuine personality. If only, she didn't have that slight delay in her dialogue delivery that puts the timing of a dialogue off. In fact, that is the problem with the entire cast, except maybe for Divya Dutta. Since the entire cast has its timing off by that fraction of a second, I guess it is the director's doing.Despite these lapses, the world of Gippi is worth a peek into. If for nothing else, just to remind you of small moments from your childhood, moments we have long forgotten.

Yet, it could have been told better. ","Would I be saying anything new at all when I say, the book is better – in the way it unfolds and in the nuances you know about the character. So, given that the book is almost always better and you cannot possibly unread a book, I'd say, if you haven't read the book and don't intend to, the movie, The Girl On The Train might just be worth the thrill. It doesn't take the usual path of a thriller suspense. It starts of with you wondering about the protagonist as she mulls in a train and talks about her obsession with the people who live by the track. And it slowly builds up about specific people who live by the track and so on. You are slowly introduced to two other women and the live they lead. But you don't get to know them too well – what do they think or like. They seem sort-of coincidental to the film. I would have liked to know them better. It is a good thing though that the characters are well-cast. Emily Blunt (Rachel), Haley Bennett (Megan) and Rebecca Ferguson (Anna) do well with the sketchy character sketches drawn for them. However, it felt like the camera did a lot of their work for them. It shook and held steady to show Rachel's drunk and sober phases. It moved a voyeuristic gaze over Megan to bring her sensuousness to us. Unfortunately, though the story doesn't take that further. It becomes an episodic narration of one thing after another with a bit of back and forth in the timeline. It might leave you a little disoriented but never disinterested. If only the big reveal came a little smoothly. If you haven't guessed already, yes – almost each of those sentences above could end with “unlike in the book”. Even if the book isn't the greatest read there is.

But owing to some witty dialogue and  perfectly timed dialogue delivery make Go Goa Gonea watch well worth it. ,"The most annoying bit about zombie films is that the story just doesn't move, only the zombies do. It starts with people becoming zombies, one inexplicable way or the other. It goes on with deadpan, gory zombies staggering around beautiful scenery. Living people fight dead people in an hour+ long chase sequence. And people beat the zombies in the last 15-20 minutes. That and you have people eating people. Go Goa Goneis more or less the same, except that it has a lot of fun along the way and is headed towards a definite purpose. Go Goa Gonestarts off with the usual toilet and sexual humor you'd find in a film involving three bachelors living together, down to the oft-repeated Hardik joke. But, it has its unique style which keeps you interested. And of course, you are waiting for the zombies to appear. Meanwhile, beyond the commonplace humor are one-liners that make you  laugh out loud. With context, even the 'globalization' dialogue, that put me off in the trailers, works. The dialogue is witty and yet, not filmy. It is the kind of language friends would speak with each other. The delivery of course, is perfectly timed, else the lines would have fallen flat. Kunal Khemu, Vir Das and Anand Tiwari carry out the buffoonery well. Puja Gupta's Luna exists just so the film doesn't become too 'man'ly. But she does well nevertheless. Saif Ali Khan has his usual screen presence, but isn't required to do much really. In fact, this film is not about the characters at all. The main leads start out as the typical good, bad and in-between trio. The distinguishing lines soon merge into all three of them being afraid while keeping their humor intact. Yet, except for a couple of times, it doesn't seem out of place. I'd think zombie films would be categorized as horror films, but Go Goa Gonedoesn't fall in the horror category. Sure, it has more than its share of gore and intestine like things being pulled out of necks but it still doesn't qualify as horror. Also, the background score is quite different from the kind we associate with horror films or even thrillers. In fact, Go Goa Gonegoes beyond these genres to even comment about things like group dynamics in terms of who become a leader and how a group goes astray without a leader. You have an additional layer of a 'social message' stuck on to it. While, I'm not too much in favor of adding meaning to a film by merely slapping on a message at the end, I'm glad Go Goa Gonehad one. At least there is more to a zombie film than people walking around like zombies. Also, the manner in which the message unfolds makes it pallatable, except for the last revision of lessons and ""moral of the story"" dialogue between the characters. Similarly, there are a couple of instances in which the people behave dumber than the zombies. Clearly, the situations have been added just to bring in some variety in an otherwise flat plot. But, they are all done in good humor and hence pass by. What makes Go Goa Gonea film worth the watch is certainly the fine manner in which comedy and horror/thriller have been combined. Who would have thought a day would come when I'd say, I'm looking forward to the sequel of a zombie film!

What will you do?"" No, this is not a question in a beauty pageant, so you can actually do what you'd really like to do. My bet is that the first thing any normal person would do is to mend their life. And that's what our man, Arun Prajapati (Salman Khan) does too. So, in that sense, it is realistic. Yet, God tussi great ho comes across as aimless as it jumps from one sub-plot to another, and doesn't make any strong comment on human nature, the meaning of love, the state of politics or any of the things that it pretends to address. The quirky style of comedy between Salman Khan and Suhail Khan works in getting you to smile every once in a while. The kind of dialogue delivery that has these weirdly placed pauses in combination with zero body language, makes even the most serious scenes and situations look funny. Unintentionally funny of course. And even though it's not slapsticky 40 year olds behaving like they are 14 looks way too silly and out of place. This does manage to keep the drama quotient low, but so low that you don't feel for any of the characters in the emotionally charged scenes and it's a tad too high on stylizing the characters. Amitabh Bachchan, of course, lends grace and elegance to the movie in general. But, the movie requires him to hold a knowing smile all through. Nothing much can be done, because God after all can only smile at our follies. Priyanka Chopra, the main lead, squealed and jumped at the appropriate times. The sad thing is, her character was introduced as an intelligent person but then as the movie progressed, that introductory episode just seemed like it was there for the sake of letting us know that she's smart. That trait didn't come up anywhere later in the movie. The side-characters all seem very superficial - Mr. Prajapati Sr. (Anupam Kher), the Mrs., their daughter, their maid, a lottery ticket seller, a beggar, an office peon. They all have significant enough roles to have recall value, but none of them have the depth needed to make them believable. Anupam Kher made me laugh a couple of times but just didn't convince me of his middle class, government servant background. His wife too wore saris to suit her character but her body language and accent was that like of a socialite.So many characters translate to as many sub-plots. Since there isn't necessarily a direct connect with the main story, these side plots are just stuck together one after the other and give the movie a very jerky feel. It almost feels like the story was never written on paper, it was just narrated over a drink and finalized.The movie has a very dated feel overall. The sets, the songs and dances, the special effects don’t look like they belong to the past 3-4 years of production. The special effects were a complete waste and most of it reserved for a shoddy, glitzy song. It'd have been so much better if the same money was spent on creatively creating the required effect on a set. Like Bruce Almighty, God tussi great ho doesn't fulfill its promising one-line plot idea. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that when God presents himself, you expect really great things to happen. But, they just don't.

The film is grim, grand but quite some fun!","Last year, we saw the Jaegers and Kaiju battle it out for big screen giant supremacy, in Guillermo del Toro’s Pacific Rim. While we know how that fun war panned out, perhaps it wouldn’t be wrong to say that Godzilla still remains the grand-daddy of all big screen mega-creatures.Six decades after Godzilla’s first big screen appearance, maverick director Gareth Edwards gives us a fun retelling of the Godzilla legend; his film is far more fun than the last Hollywood Godzilla film, the 1998 one directed by Roland Emmerich. What makes it fun is the fact that the film is also a strange sort of superhero film; yes, you read that right.Watch this one right from the first frame, because the cleverly designed opening credits lay the groundwork for the story of the film, before we launch into the real thing. Unexplained earthquakes, a devastated nuclear plant; and things get mysterious as an American engineer in Japan begins fearing that something far more dangerous is the cause for it. 15 years later, the world gets to see just what the cause of the tremors was... Set initially in Japan before moving to San Francisco for the finale, the film takes its time to build, and one of the best things about the film is that the monsters aren’t overused. They make their appearance late, and are never properly revealed to the audience right through the film. While that automatically conveys a sense of massive scale, it also makes each appearance of every monster an event, making the film almost always interesting, because you don’t quite know what gigantic bit of action is going to take place next.But what I truly loved about this Godzilla reboot is just how much it draws from ‘monster master’ Ishirô Honda’s 1954 film. (Remember, the dedication in the very last frame of the end credits of Pacific Rim?) When Godzilla made his first appearance in 1954 it was essentially a metaphor for the horrors that Japan faced by being the first victims of a nuclear bomb. Godzilla stood for the ills of nuclear power, and that thought is carried forward in this film, right through to the connection with Japan. Godzilla’s iconic wail and his hulking shape look better than ever before, and you almost cheer every appearance of his. The film is beautifully shot - very atmospheric and moody. However, it would have ideally been enjoyed best in 2D, because the 3D doesn’t add much, and the glasses obviously make the dark images even darker. What’s also nice is that the film isn’t merely about monsters and booms. There’s a story and there are characters with a personal stake as well. In fact, a lot of time is actually spent making us invest in these characters, so that we aren’t just rooting for nameless and faceless crowds of people. It unfolds at a leisurely pace initially, but it doesn’t bother you at all, because of its crisp runtime. In fact, it adds nicely to the sense of tension, as you’re waiting for the epic battles that the film is ultimately about. Strangely enough, with this film, you feel a far more personal connect with Godzilla than you’ve ever felt. And Godzilla reminds you, once again, that heroes come in all shapes and sizes.

Though there is not much to call a story in Golmaal 3, it does provide a good experience nevertheless. Also, it is a mad caper spoof of several Bollywood movies – both retro and current.","Note from meetu - Diwali on Fridays has been one of my worst dilemmas. wogma vs. family - a couple of the most high-profile films of the year versus the annual extended family get-together?

Wish you all a bright Diwali and a brighter year ahead! 
What works for Golmaal 3 is distinctiveness of all its characters and a fair share of spotlight on all of them. If not for this, the movie could have easily been one aimless chaotic drone, considering that it has a bevy of harebrained, crazy characters.  Set in Goa, the movie is kept afloat with incessant squabbles of a gang of five aimless cons (Ajay, Shreyas and Arshad, Tusshar and Kunal) aided by a delightfully dishy chick (Kareena) and an earnest elderly couple (Mithun and Ratna Pathak Shah). Add a mad, forgetful goon (Jhonny Lever) with his two ‘retro’grade henchman - therein lies an endless possibility of mindless wit and situational comedy.  It is as if director Rohit Shetty did not want to repeat the mistakes of the previous one (yeah, I know that last year’s Diwali release Golmaal 2 was also a hit, but..) – there are no crutch characters. Even Kareena’s character is seamlessly woven into the narrative and has equal share as the boys.  Yet what the movie loses in plot, it makes up in abundance with its wealth of jokes, funny one-liners, spoofs and situational comedies. The movie is one long standup comedy show where, more than the story, you wait for punches that are to be delivered. (I laughed at even the most cliché ones.) Rohit Shetty has also interspersed the movie with several Bollywood references. There is a spoof of rich girl, poor boy love story, atypical of Bollywood in 70s. Prem Chopra plays a cameo reminiscent of old times, and Mithun da receives a tribute of sorts by living his ‘Disco Dancer’ again. Then, there is Hum Saath Saath Hain playing in the family drawing room and Ghajni that lends a creditable gimmick to the plot.  Jokes on fellow actors find place too, predictably Emran Hashmi features. Shahid is called Kameena (y), which could be interpreted in more than one ways, and then there is a dig even at Kareena’s ‘zero figure’.  Music is fun and high-intensity, even if not very noteworthy (not surprising, since mood is mirthful). Two tracks, Disco Dancer and Yaad Aa Raha Hai, are from Mithun da’s old movie, Disco Dancer. See, what I mean by tribute to Mithun Da. Movie is also replete with characteristic Rohit Shetty-esque quirks – action scenes with cars being smashed, the chase, the Golmaal vehicle - a 5-seater motorbike this time, and elaborate opening sequences.  The fast-paced screenplay with its heavy slapstick couldn’t have been executed without the chemistry, camaraderie and comic timing of the cast.  And when you have so many lead characters, it is only fair to credit each actor for making their quirks stand out. Though it was Ajay Devgan who not only got a grungy makeover, but also had an edge with all the masterstrokes bestowed to his character. The only two talented actors that I felt bad about were Mukesh Tiwari and Ashwini Kalsekar, who had little to do and were much ignored in this one. I also want to send a shout-out to the costume/dress designers that made their unobtrusive contribution to humor (not to mention the bright look and feel)– those typical costumes from 70s that Mithun and Ratna wear, note Jhonny Lever’s pants (Rajesh Khanna? :P) and those of his dapper henchmen. Also, I am intrigued how most actors in comedies can easily carry off violet, firozi (sky blue) and pink shirts as well as colourful pants.That said, movie is not without flaws, the end doesn’t come with a big bang. Instead, the climax takes its droll course in a maddening chaos with all the characters present on screen. Also, movie could have done with some editing scissors to blot out few repetitions. In addition, sometimes during a sequence, for example the one with Mithun and th dog, the audience patiently waited for a chaotic caper to subside, awaiting a new joke. Melodrama of 70s story playing out between Mithun and Ratna outside the church was another sequence that felt bit stretched.  Yet, bottom-line is you will laugh. Even the cynic will watch it with a wide smile, minus too many cringes. Here’s to a hilarious Diwali.

Through the movie you wonder what part of it was expecting to be called magic – the bright, fairy-tale-like, shoddy  computer-generated graphics; the histrionics of a ghost; or the superhuman power that allows for a fourth episode in this series. My mind which, ironically worked a little too hard to let go of logic, could only see the makers attempt at providing logic where none was expected. It is indeed a fair attempt in trying to build a story around ghosts. Unsurprisingly though, it neither makes you laugh nor appreciate the effort. In fact, the writing is often repetitive as the ghost demonstrates its existence or when scenes over-explain. The jokes too are often stretched too far, stifling the smile that had just begun to erupt. A lot of it is also repetitions from the previous editions. And some humor, such as the use of Ku Klux Klan costumes, is completely lost on me. There are other scenes that are  just so silly that you can't help laugh at the silliness - this is the essence of  a Golmaal film, so even if I don't enjoy it I've stopped minding it. But, what we are not used to is the semblance of a plot. As a safety measure, the film even throws in a couple of social messages – anti-superstition statements are well-pronounced and there is even a flippant, “educate your girl child” line. I didn't know if I should laugh or cry at this last one. A pro-girl-education slogan when the two women characters, of the 10-12 people in the main cast, were treated rather shabbily. Parineeti Chopra's character is muted out through half the film because, you know, the man oggling at her is so mesmerized by her that he can only see her and not hear her. On the other end, Tabu's character is delegated to voice-over through a lot of her part too. All things aside, the makers didn't even bother to get female singers while they show these two sing in a group song! And of course there is objectification in songs, one with kids too! That these two were given strong characters then seems like poor lip service. Also, the hideous father-daughter hooking-up jokes don't help at all. Of course, there is Shreyas Talpade's lisp and Tusshar Kapoor's aa-ee-ooooo which is shameful but they continue to do it well. Ajay Devgn seems jaded. Arshad Warsi tries very hard to make his presence felt and Kunal Khemu exists. Tabu and Parineeti Chopra do act like they are shouldering the film, which is quite the truth too. I watched Golmaal Again in a single screen theater in one of Maharashtra's northern villages. The men:women ratio was about 99:1 in this almost 500-seater. Usually, people hoot, whistle and dance irrespective of what is going in the film. My usual city-girl gripe is that the sound is atrocious and no one complains about it. It is a good, annual reality check. This is how most of India's audience watches its films. This time around again, the movie started off with hardly audible sound. But, I was pleasantly surprised when there was a shout out from the audience for better sound and the projectionist did his best! People were actually interested in the dialogue. There were huge parts of the film where the audience was watching and listening attentively too! I am not sure though if that is a good thing for the film.

A festival of poor writing, gay jokes, random songs, SMS forwards, etc","Some antics are best left to Tom & Jerry. That kind of violence is just not funny when humans do it, especially when set in a really long Ekta Kapoor soap opera. Yep, Golmaal Returns is that bad!What's with this trend of having half the dialogues referring to another movie/ TV show? Every other scene has one such reference here with Sanjay Leela Bhansali taking the worst hit. How many more movies are going to do this? Is our creativity limited to laughing at another's expense? Which could have been grudgingly acceptable were it done at least a little less crudely. Like in Golmaal, Tusshar Kapoor's mute character comes as a welcome relief in the midst of all the screaming and yelping. And he is the only one who managed to make me laugh. And then that too became repetitive. Women, as we are supposed to expect, are mere eye candy and to be referred to as the men's property. Jealousy is just about the only emotion they are allowed. It almost felt like these particular women were cast only to balance off the men in the looks department. I see no other reason for casting Celina Jaitley with Shreyas Talpade and Amrita Arora with Arshad Warsi. The Ajay Devgan-Kareena Kapoor pair is alright in an Omkara but here it just feels like a complete mismatch. Especially when Kareena behaves all insecure about Ajay's faithfulness. And don't even get me started on how badly placed and picturized the songs are. And they sound awful too.The silver lining to this dark, dark cloud is that I completely enjoyed the transitions used to put together two scenes. So much so that I began waiting for the scene to end, so I could see how they are going to move on to the next one. Of course, that was not the only reason I wanted scene after scene to end, but nevertheless credit given where it is due. So, how many of you would see a movie just for its transitions?There's this scene towards the end where each member of the cast walks towards a noose hanging down a tree threatening to commit suicide. Now, three cheers to that one!

340,438,438,438,438,Gone Girl,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/gone-girl-review/,,3/5.0,,2.9,"David Fincher's latest, an adaptation of Gillian Flynn's racy novel Gone Girl, has enough thrills to keep you glued to the screen for all of its run time. Read the book first, though, if you truly want to glean all you can from both forms in which this complex relationship between a man and a woman is explored.","Gillian Flynn's novel Gone Girl is a terrific piece of pop-lit; a racy thriller that forms the setting for some audacious characters and great insights into people and relationships. Although narrated completely in first person, it always had the trappings of a film in it - a film that would truly take some making.Some of David Fincher's most popular films were adapted from novels, and he has a penchant for making films that outshone their books. The expectations for Gone Girl, naturally, were through the roof. What we get is a mixed bag - while the film is a neat little thriller when viewed as a standalone entity, it does rob you of many, many gob smacking moments that the book offers you.A man comes home one day to discover that his wife is missing. Naturally, the needle of suspicion is on him. As he battles the cops and public perception to prove his innocence, we slowly see the story of the couple unravel.  Gone Girl draws you in from go. Hope seems sucked out right from the first frame of the film, as Nick Dunne goes on to lose his wife. Ben Affleck suits the character beautifully; we alternate between his outer personality - a product of his upbringing - and his inner despair, as things begin to go south for him rather quickly. Then, there's Amy, who we get to know early on through her diary entries. Rosamund Pike looks a lot like one would expect her to look. But somewhere, it seems like the essence of her character is lost. We get to see what Amy does, but we hardly get to know what she feels. In fact, what seems to be sorely lacking from the film is a deeper understanding into the relationship between Nick and Amy. What made their fairytale romance so special, and then what went wrong? The answer, of course, lies in the two characters, but it's a pity that we hardly ever get to see them together on screen. Any relationship goes through the test of time, and to truly justify why Amy disappeared, it would have worked infinitely better for the film if we got to see more of what made Nick and Amy tick, and what didn't. There are David Fincher's deft little touches, though, which add beautiful little layers to the film - watch out, for instance, for the accessories that embellish Amy's pencils while writing her diary at various points. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's dissonant music score is another facet that aids the film's overall sense of unease and discomfort. Here in India, the censor board has ensured that the film is that wee bit more annoying to watch, because of a strange pan-and-zoom method that has been used to mask some of the violent or sexually explicit content - essentially, the image blows up and shifts to the least offensive part of the frame in an awkward manner, ruining much of the experience.Gone Girl still makes for a gripping watch - for the mysteriously unfolding tale, for the cast that largely suits the characters, and for some genuine insight into the complexities of human thought. However, for a truly enriching experience, I strongly suggest you read the book before watching the film.

341,439,439,439,439,[A] Good Day to Die Hard,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/good-day-to-die-hard-review/,,5/5.0,,3.566666667,"Bruce Willis is back with the fifth Die Hard film, A Good Day to Die Hard. This latest film, however, isn’t even as much fun as the previous one (which itself was merely passable), let alone the original or the two quite watchable films that came after it. Packed with more unnecessary action than one would care for, even Bruce Willis’ trademark punchline (you know which!) has never been used as poorly as it has been here. Safe to avoid this film altogether and do a marathon of the first three in the series on home video. ","Those who’ve watched Zero Dark Thirty or Homeland will be familiar with a torture technique that involves not letting captive prisoners sleep by playing loud, noisy music and shining bright lights on them at all times. I’d only be slightly exaggerating if I said that they could just have put them in a theatre playing A Good Day to Die Hard instead.Nearly a quarter of a century after Bruce Willis’ John McClane first scorched the big screen with unflinching, deadpan badass-ery, the aged but still cheerful action superstar returns in the fifth installment of the series; one that should have ended with the previous film. Directed by John Moore, the film is set in Russia this time, where John McClane has come in pursuit of his estranged son who is in the custody of the authorities there. However, he quite soon discovers that his son isn’t your usual vagabond imprisoned by the Commies – about then, I think that there might just be a feeble attempt at a story. All hopes of that evaporate soon after, however, as the Father-Son McClane duo spend the rest of their screen time bringing Russia to rubble all by themselves, with the customary few scratches to their own bodies. Loosely put, Taken with a yippee-ki-yay touch, with a pointless background story of what seems like a domestic quarrel between rich and powerful Russian men.If the sorry excuse for a plot makes you grimace, the execution of the film is nothing less than an assault on the senses. Humans, vehicles, buildings and even public infrastructure are treated with the same amount of disdain by the trigger-happy McClanes, who don’t for a second seem to think discretion is an option. After all, why waste time thinking, when you can blow something up? 
Admittedly, the high-octane camera work had me for about the first 20 minutes, before I realized that the octane level didn’t ever intend to dip. After that, it was all about trying to out-think the writer and director in terms of how ludicrous they could get. What is good to see though is that Bruce Willis hasn’t gotten over his penchant for having fun while the world is crumbling around him, with or without his interference. He adds a cutesy comic touch to John McClane’s paternal instincts, as he straddles the line between being a father looking out for his son and being the original bad guy hunter. Jai Courtney, who plays McClane’s son Jack, hasn’t a friction of the screen presence or likeability of Willis. He is bland with emotion as well as humour, which makes the father-and-son reconciliation aspect of the film seem like a bit of a joke. A Good Day To Die Hard is a tedious watch, because the film never eases up on the action, fully testing the limits of your suspension of disbelief. If there is anything good about the film at all, it is that it may make fans of the original films go back and revisit them, just for some good old-fashioned action fun. The only people who might find the film watchable are those who are absolute hard-core and exclusive action film fans, but for whom Chulbul Pandey is a bit too low-brow.

342,440,440,440,440,Good Night Good Morning,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/good-night-good-morning-review/,,5/5.0,,3.566666667,"As I walked out of the theatre Good Night Good Morning reminded me of  the idea of a one night stand. For many of us, the idea of a stimulating, soul-searching conversation (or alternatively a frivolous repartee) is as exciting as a one-night stand, and the conversation in the film plays out like a verbal night of pleasure; one that you recall with a sigh every now and then. Watch the film to applaud Kamath’s ability (and co-writer Shilpa Rathnam) to make a well-budgeted, stimulating film. ","The split screen, black and white poster of Sudhish Kamath’s independent film Good Night Good Morning gives away much about movie than meets the eye. Ofcourse, the obvious ones go first – it’s a film around two people, Turiya (Manu Narayan) and Moira (Seema Rahmani). You are given two perspectives, an oscillation of conflicting ideas of romance and a conversation that starts at night and ends in the morning. In this gamut of duality, lies the film. It also tears you, as a viewer into two. Should you criticize the film for its flaws and amateurism? Or should you applaud Sudhish Kamath’s ability to stressfully release an independent film in a world where the demand for shiny, bright and rather expensive stars erase a basic sense of plot? Allow me to discuss both sides of the coin. The film is set in New York on New Year’s night. It had me hooked the minute it spent exactly 30 seconds panning through Times Square. We are immediately introduced to the tone of the film, with a nostalgic jazz background score walking with you into the introduction. It’s a beautiful way to begin the film because it’s this visual romance that is later contested in the conversation that makes the film. Here Moira (Rahmani) is seated in a bar, alone on New Year’s Eve. She’s defensive and wary of any stereotype coming her way. She meets Turiya (Narayan) and a bunch of his inebriated friends in the bar, after which we immediately cut to her hotel room where she’s talking to Turiya on the phone, who’s driving back to Philadelphia with his friends. The first few minutes of the conversation (on screen, as the narrative keeps jumping back and forth) are my favorite. It has that awkward undertone where both parties try their hardest to make it sound that the conversation is offhand. You know, the kind of conversation you would have with a stranger, where you justify it to yourself in the name of boredom. Moira is playful and unabashed, whereas Turiya is self-conscious and trying his hardest to make an impression. What follows is a dialogue-heavy intervention into both their lives. Their notions and ideas of romance slowly unfold – and it beautifully pits you into two confusing boxes. Where do you lie? With Turiya – who in spite of claiming to be a romantic is stuck in a love-less, obsessive rut of his past or with Moira – who claims to have had her share of heartbreaks and still does not give up on the idea of romance? Most of the film is shown in split screen, where the easy camera presence of both Narayan and Rahmani makes the conversation a pleasant, engaging one. The film attempts to steer away from the monotony by cutting to flashbacks and parodied hypothetical situations that the pair put themselves in to make conversation. My personal favorite is the film’s spoof of the Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. It’s through these little skits (that are in color, and serve as a pleasant alternative) that we explore the two protagonists’ psyche. There were some moments in the film however, that could have easily been done away with. For example, Turiya’s friends JC, Hussain and random passed out guy (Raja Sen, Vasanth Santosham) are unnecessary. They try too hard to stand as valid side characters (especially Raja Sen, who’s adorable in parts but his constant cannabis-smile, gets a bit tedious) It would have been a much more personal and stimulating film had the conversation been between her in the hotel room, and him driving the car alone. The sub-plot of the friends brings the film down, just when you’re deeply getting involved in the momentum of the conversation. The entire angle of Moira’s past, her constant nightmares also drag a bit towards the latter half of the film, and we are told very little about Turiya’s past. It’s a misbalance that can be seen and it is these aspects that give the film an amateur feel. The conversation that ties Good Night Good Morning could have done with more wit. It should have been the kind of conversation that starts with a crackle and the need to outshine the other to prove yourself of a worthy dialogue. .  Such a conversation has the ability to become like a magnifying glass with time – one that makes you plunge into deep recesses of yourself through the medium of another person. However, as someone who writes about films, I can only imagine the stress level I would be in if I were to make a film of my own. Primarily for this reason, Kamath’s film (he’s also the film critic for The Hindu) should be watched and discussed. It’s the least you could do as a viewer.  Though in isolation, Good Night Good Morning is an interesting film, and an extremely fascinating play of a type of conversation that most people have had.

343,441,441,441,441,[The] Good Road,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/good-road-review/,,,,3.566666667,"As hard as it probably will be, the biggest favour you can do yourself is to watch Gyan Correa’s The Good Road with a completely clean slate, not worrying about Oscars and The Lunchbox and anything of the sort. Whether the film stacks up to its expectations is a different story altogether. But watch it with a blank mind, and you might just take something away from it.","Everyone in Gyan Correa’s The Good Road is lost. But spend a second introspecting about your own life and you might just ask yourself, “Do even I really know where I am?” The harsh highway in Gujarat, then, that forms the setting for the stories in The Good Road is quite likely a metaphor for life itself. And, as a character quite rightly says in the film, there are so many highways in India - so many lives and so many stories just waiting to be told.David, Kiran and their 7-year-old son Aditya are a young family from Mumbai on a vacation to Gujarat. A twist of circumstance leads Aditya to be separated from his parents, and he ends up traveling with Pappu and Shaukat - a pair of truckers who are on a bit of a mission of their own, so to speak. Then there’s Poonam, a little girl on her way to meet her grandmother in Athangasa, who unfortunately ends up exactly where a little 11-year-old girl by herself must not go.The three stories wind around each other to form the film’s narrative – simple, sparse tales that, bit by bit, reveal a little about the characters as they voice their thoughts and apprehensions. Pappu, Shaukat and Aditya, for instance, develop a strange relationship as they spend time with each other. Aditya, in particular, makes you see that divisions and a sense of ‘us and them’ is something that you truly develop only as you grow older. The innocence of a child is always a great leveler – it almost never distinguishes between two people based on exterior factors that us adults are most likely to spot.There is no attempt at a graph, no attempt at infusing any drama into the film. Quite like life itself, the film just trudges along based on what a particular characters believes or wants to do at a particular moment. This approach lends a mature tone to The Good Road, though I can completely imagine people finding the narrative too slow for its own good. We in India aren’t too used to films that don’t attempt to create a graph, which don’t try to creep up on the audience with a twist or two, and just go where the characters take them. In that sense, The Good Road is a good example of storytelling for the sake of the story, and not for the sake of the audience. That being said, one can’t but help feel that if you are relying so heavily on characters and their relationships to drive a story, it becomes absolutely imperative for every character to actually stay in character and behave in character. Many a time there are instances where you notice the characters avoid the most obvious logical steps to take in a situation, instead they do something completely counter-intuitive. The screenplay of the film, then, ends up striking too many false notes – strange, considering that it was developed at one of Film Bazaar Screenwriters’ Lab of 2008.The film also suffers from some unimpressive key performances. Ajay Gehi has always been a bit too overenthusiastic in front of the camera. Here, as David, he does pretty much the same thing. Sonali Kulkarni, who always manages to convey just the right amount of emotion, does well, despite her small role. Little Keval Katrodia as Aditya charms you with his naivety. The real letdown is Shamji Dhana Kesaria as Pappu. The relationship Pappu develops with Aditya is heartwarming, but doesn’t quite have the intended effect because Kesaria is plain expressionless. Priyank Upadhyay, who plays his sidekick Shaukat, is an absolute natural, though. Some of the other minor characters who appear through the film are supposedly locals who were made to act, and the rawness shows often.The film, however, benefits immensely from the sun-bathed landscape of Gujarat, which lends itself to many a poignant frame in the film. In fact, the stark, bare-minimum movement of the camera works really well for the tone of the film, Rather than impressing you outright with gorgeous cinematography, the film lets the composition of frames and the subjects do the talking. A special mention must also be made of the sound design. The film actually relies a lot on the sounds to create a sense of place and time, often even more than the visuals.There aren’t many who pause to think about this, but a film is almost always only as good as what each member of the audience takes with them before experiencing the film. If you don’t usually watch a film for the second time within a few days of your first viewing, then try it once. I can guarantee that the same film will look different based on your state of mind. Keeping this in mind, it becomes extremely difficult to view The Good Road with an objective mindset, considering the furore over its selection as India’s official entry for the Academy Awards’ best Foreign Language Film category after the widespread support, even internationally, for The Lunchbox. Still, I’d urge you to keep all of it out of your mind before catching The Good Road on DVD. While the DVD itself holds nothing more than the film, if you love cinema and like giving different kinds of cinema a shot, then try this one too. Is the film better than The Lunchbox? Debatable, because such questions don’t have a yes-no answer. Is the film good enough to represent India internationally? Probably not. Will it make it to the final Academy Awards shortlist? Almost certainly not. But is the film worth a watch for some gorgeous visuals and sounds, and a rare maturity in its storytelling that rises above the issues in its writing? The honest answer is, “Yes”.

And if there happens to be a man who is in love with her and is willing to give it his all, nothing like it. That's how, dear friend, you come upon a romantic comedy that takes up social causes. Putting it this way, might be a little unfair, belittling the larger purpose of the film too. But then the dry and functional manner in which events take place do not get you involved at all.Starting from the basics, a romantic film has to be able to convey that the couple is in love with each other. Just by pointing out an age difference, the matter isn't taken care of, is it? Doesn't the audience need to be convinced that they love each other? Some chemistry other than a superficial ""good deed""? Superficial - that is the word that comes to mind through the film - be it the romance, the comedy or the social causes that our lady, Dia (Kareena Kapoor) takes up. By the end, almost every thing that happens earlier comes across as a set-up. Any joke made, anything negative or positive said ties up neatly in the end to either be related back to or reversed in a very contrived fashion. Given that the dialogue and comic lines work very briefly and you have seen most of them in the trailer, you are left with the actual cause taken up by Dia. That and how the situation is handled could have been an engaging affair. But well, it gets repetitive and was anyway predictable from the word go. With way too many songs in the beginning and an avoidable narrative thread to the film, Gori Tere Pyaar Mein is also too long. Sure, the narrator is also used as an alter ego, but it just makes the transition, well, superficial. :)It doesn't help that Kareena Kapoor wears designer outfits even when she's staying in a remote village in Gujrat. I guess we should just be thankful that she repeats the outfits. The only silver lining, however, is that Kareena Kapoor gives a decent performance. Imran Khan is his usual self - doesn't impress but doesn't annoy either.  The cast in the Gujrat village though were refreshingly at home. From the little boy to the village head, they all added to the ambiance of the village.Yet again, a romantic comedy that is underwhelming. At least, in this case we didn't expect any different.

345,443,443,443,443,Govinda,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/govinda-review/,,,,2.966666667,"Swapnil Joshi puts in a valiant performance in a film that otherwise quite simply doesn’t make the cut. Preachy and message-heavy but treated the way films were about three decades ago, Govinda tries too hard but has very little to show for it. ","The female lead character in Govinda is a woman named Shraavni (or Shravani; I’m not sure how it is spelled.) A vivacious, fun girl who doesn’t take a second to turn tough when the time calls for it, who doesn’t blink before making a sacrifice for the man she loves and yet one who doesn’t particularly adhere to what our hypocritical society self-righteously defines as a ‘good Indian woman’. Her character is easily the best thing about the film. Considering the rest of the film, though, I couldn’t help wonder if, how the character turned out, was a bit of an accident.The man Shraavni is in love with is named Rajan; a street-smart, resourceful fellow who is supposedly studying for the MPSC exam, but is more interested in putting all of his time and effort into celebrating every Hindu festival with fervour. This, we’re told, is what constitutes devotion to the almighty. What primarily brings this film down is the fact that, starting from the protagonist Rajan, every character in the film makes his character sketch abundantly clear, before going on to behave completely out of character at crucial junctures in the film.With a plot and treatment that would have seemed far more at home in the 80s, the film’s intentions are no doubt noble. It wants to talk about principles like honesty and sincerity; about the responsibilities that are on your shoulders when you’re in love with someone; about the importance of family and friends; about the necessity to preserve one’s culture; about the plight of politics in our country; and perhaps about some other issues that I may have missed while trying to separate one from the other. In short, Govinda is a veritable potpourri of values that people probably don’t have time for in this day and age. While director Aatmaram Dharne briefly skirts with all these morals and principles in the first hour, in the second hour he goes full throttle into shoving the various messages that the film wants to convey down the audiences’ throats, with characters stepping out to deliver sermons in full seriousness. The film does hold your attention for longer than you expect it to, though. The primary reason for this is Swapnil Joshi’s performance as Rajan. Despite his character’s flip-flops – no, not footwear – he invests himself completely into Rajan. He does look a tad too old to be playing the age he supposedly is in the film, but you look past that because of Joshi’s conviction in the character. Girija Joshi, who plays Shraavni, isn’t particularly great. But you root for Shraavni nonetheless.Now technique has always been a problem with Marathi films because of their limited budgets, and this film is no exception. It bears a dated look throughout, and depends on far too many close ups to make up for the lack of production value. Indeed, sometimes one can’t help feel a little sorry for the film, and hence be a little too lenient in judging it. But the sad truth is that some crisp, mature writing would have made it into a different film, its technical problems notwithstanding.Because of the film’s 80s-style treatment and emphasis on values, the film may make for a fair family watch on satellite release - it has the kind of chest-beating traditionalism about it that the more self-consciously conservative amongst us might actually enjoy. However, that is precisely the kind of treatment that people are most likely to forget about the moment the film is over. One can’t help feel that subtlety would have probably been more successful in making the message stick; particularly since contemporary India could undeniably do with some of the values the film speaks about.

As gorgeous as ever, as zany as ever, The Grand Budapest Hotel is another proud entrant into the Anderson oeuvre. ","One always approaches a Wes Anderson film with trepidation. There are expectations, yes; but there are also those lingering fears: Will the bubble burst? Will the new world that you’re about to enter enchant like the previous one he created? Will he finally cross the thin line that his indulgent attention to seemingly pointless detail treads? But then, I suppose that’s the hallmark of a true visionary – that once you’re inside the cinema and the lights dim, everything else fades away, and you’re sucked in.The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the most gorgeous films you can hope to see on the big screen. Beautifully staged, meticulously crafted frames that blend into each other like clockwork (each more captivating than the other), a universe of its own with enticingly flawed characters that inhabit it; all the staple Anderson tropes are there. Yet, he just seems to get better with each film. Set in three different time periods, the longest of which is in pre-World War II Europe, The Grand Budapest Hotel is essentially a caper film – it has robbery, murder, jailbreak, mystery, love, brotherhoods, wills and heirs and everything else that can glue one to their seat. And with the Anderson flourish, it becomes an experience all its own.Ralph Fiennes plays Gustave, a concierge at the titular hotel – a man gifted with words, women and a natural magnetic charm that makes him a leader. Looking at him with wide-eyed awe is an oddly named bell boy Zero. It is their escapades that propel the film, as they battle the likes of a deadly assassin and the Anderson reimagining of the Nazi SS – the ZZ – and we watch a story within a story, gobsmacked at the sheer beauty and craft on display.There’s also the subtle humour laced through the film, as characters stop in the middle of the tensest of situations to ponder on something unnecessary (but never irrelevant). In fact, Anderson’s penchant for humour is quite unparalleled, as long as you’re only looking for the slightest of smiles to remain plastered on your face through the length of the film.But even in his crazed other-world where characters are the kind you’ve never seen before, they’re always written beautifully, rock-solid to the last ‘d’. You never once feel that a character behaves in any way that seems out of place for them – and there are plenty of loonies to keep you interested at all times. Even the sinister – almost heartless - aspects of the plot race along merrily with unabashed glee. Here is a filmmaker who can make the pointless murder of a cat seem just a wee bit ticklish. In fact, the manner in which morality is effortlessly reduced to nothing more than a point of view is one of the most interesting aspects of the film, once you’ve left it behind and are letting the experience sink in.The icing, then, is the cast of the film. While Anderson’s staples like Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody and the likes make appearances big and small – and each of them is a delight – the film belongs to Ralph Fiennes and young Tony Revolori who plays Zero. Their timing and spontaneity is impeccable, and they bounce off each other like crazy balls. Special mention must also be made of Willem Defoe’s terrifyingly hilarious look in the film – he plays Jopling, the assassin mentioned earlier.Wes Anderson is one of those rare filmmakers whose every indulgence you’re willing to forgive, simply because of the loving detail he infuses into his frames, shots, scenes and characters. The Grand Budapest Hotel is yet another feather in his colourful and doubtlessly centre-aligned hat.

348,446,446,446,446,Grandmaster,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/grandmaster-review/,,3/5.0,,3.4,"Smart for the most part, Grandmaster holds some genuine thrills because of a nicely paced script and an effortless performance from Mohanlal, one that packs a wallop just when it needs to. In spite of some weak character performances, Grandmaster manages to engage you throughout. ","Filmmakers looking to avoid flak for screenplay should usually stay clear of the thriller genre, because it is virtually impossible to have a water-tight screenplay and still make a successfully thrilling mystery that hooks the audience from start to end. While I must confess that I least expected it to, Mohanlal-starrer Grandmaster, produced by UTV, actually manages to avoid some of the pitfalls of a serial-killer-murder-mystery story. Powered by a surprisingly sharp script and a master-class in underplaying a lead character, Grandmaster, directed by Unnikrishnan B, makes for an intriguing watch. Yes, it has its share of flaws in the writing, but the pace of the film rarely lets you dwell on them, diverting attention instead to the mental game of chess that the protagonist is playing, more with himself than with the antagonist.Chandra Sekhar, played by Mohanlal, is a top cop who is past his prime, more because of a personal problem than anything else. He is now heading the newly-formed Metro Crime Stopper Cell, aimed at preventing crime – a department that is underperforming because of Chandra Sekhar’s weak leadership. A former National-level chess player, Chandra Sekhar’s is jolted out of his mental inertia when the writer of a mysterious letter proclaims that she or he intends to play a deadly game with Chandra Sekhar, one that is intricately tied with Chandra Sekhar’s personal life.Thus begins a series of murders, embellished with tantalizing clues and mysterious taunts. With each murder, Chandra Sekhar is sucked in further, as he matches his wits with a faceless opponent in what could be the most important game of chess in his life – one where a checkmate could be fatal. What works the most for Grandmaster is the character of Chandra Sekhar. A man who was once the toast of the police department, now broken and lonely, spurred into action because of a maniacal serial killer. Add to that, a man named Mohanlal. There aren’t many actors who use their eyes the way Mohanlal does. Perhaps not blessed with as much natural screen presence as some of his superstar contemporaries, his eyes separate his craft from the rest of the pack. They rove about the screen slowly, partaking in the journey towards the resolution that a cinematic character must invariably be rewarded (or punished) with. Mohanlal plays Chandra Sekhar so subtly and competently that it would be easy to mistake this performance as just one amongst the hundreds that he has given. But look closer and you see just why he is considered one of the finest actors in the country, and why he is my personal favourite Indian actor by some distance. He slips into the character, walking, talking, thinking and fighting the way a wounded tiger forced to protect his domain would.As mentioned earlier, the film has its share of flaws, primarily in the writing and then in the performances. There are plot holes that could have been avoided, and some situations in the screenplay are a tad farfetched. Also, while the beautiful Priyamani, playing Mohanlal’s ex-wife, is a competent actor, some important side characters are quite weak, crossing over to plain overacting - a huge problem that is compounded because of how subtly Mohanlal has played his character.It then boils down to just the simple fact that Grandmaster has you on the idiomatic edge of your seat throughout. The film is paced just right, the twists in the screenplay don’t really jar, and the climactic revelation really worked for me, though I must confess I’m not sure how many people would agree with me on that. Nonetheless, for those who like being hooked to a thriller, Grandmaster makes for a decent watch. And to truly savour it, pay special attention to Mohanlal’s eyes.

349,447,447,447,447,Gravity,Owner's Pride!,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/gravity-review/,,5/5.0,,4.4,"Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity is quite likely the movie event of the year. Stunningly simple in its entirety as a film, but unbelievably complex in the way that simplicity has been achieved, Gravity might just change a lot about the way films are made in Hollywood.","In Gravity, Mexican maestro Alfonso Cuarón has made black look more gorgeous than it has ever seemed on the big screen.While there is no judging someone who doesn't like Gravity (indeed, there's no judging anyone at all for having their own personal opinion on any work of art) the thing is that, more than any other recent film, if you love this film, then you absolutely want everyone else to love it too. You want to share with them the truly immersive experience that Cuarón, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and the entire visual effects and production team behind Gravity have created for all of us.So, as you settle in to your seats, and you read the opening text and get on with the film itself, I dare you to not blink until the first cut in the film. You won't be able to do this of course, because the first shot of the film lasts long. Really long. But then, that's trademark Cuarón. Fact is that the best, most terrific aspects of Gravity are virtually invisible. They're what are behind the seemingly simple task of making a largely two-character film with almost minimal visible production design. Gravity is path-breaking without appearing to be. It is the kind of epic that doesn't quite claim to be one; it just is. If Y Tu Mamá También was audacious and Children of Men was visionary, (and if you thought The Prisoner of Azkaban was the best-directed Harry Potter film,) then Gravity is downright epochal in writing, execution and performance.At a crisp 90 minutes, Gravity is at once a taut sci-fi thriller as well as a gripping human drama. ""Two astronauts get stranded in space after a freak accident,"" may sound like it has nothing to it. But, as you experience a suitably charming performance by George Clooney and an absolutely marvellous turn by Sandra Bullock, you realize that at the heart of the ground-breaking technique - that has helped Gravity become not just one of the best space-based films ever, but also arguably the best use of 3D in cinema, period - lies the most primal human instinct of attempting to survive against all odds.  Yet, it isn't just one aspect of Gravity that makes it the cinematic experience that it is. There's the sound design - space has no medium and hence sound can't travel in space - combined with the terse, visceral background score. Then there are some gorgeous frames that have been lit unlike anything you've seen before. There's the most realistic zero-gravity effect you've ever seen characters in. Then, there's also that brief moment early on that makes you smile; when a secondary character begins to sing a classic Hindi song.Gravity is the kind of film that you must watch once, then - irrespective of whether you loved it or you didn't see the big deal in it - go devour every online resource about the making of the film, and then go back and watch again. That's when you'll truly appreciate the unassuming spectacle that it truly is.If you're a fan of cinema, then watch Gravity right from the first frame till the last frame of the closing credits. If you're a fan of Hindi film music, then don't shy away from smiling wide when you see the names of Shailendra and Shankar-Jaikishen in the end credits. With Gravity, you have to let yourself be sucked into a world you could scarcely have imagined. Even though the tagline of the film is, 'Don't let go,' do yourself a favour and do let go when you watch it; because, somewhere, even Sir Isaac Newton surely has.

350,448,448,448,448,[The] Great Gatsby,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/great-gatsby-review/,,5/5.0,,4.4,"Eye-candy but rarely more, Baz Luhrmann’s The Great Gatsby joins the list of screen adaptations that fail to match up to their literary counterparts. Good performances don’t succeed in elevating the film to where it truly deserved to be, considering the richness of the source. You won’t miss much if you skip the film, though you probably wouldn’t mind giving it a shot if you’ve read and loved the book, or if you’re desperate to see Amitabh Bachchan in his first, albeit miniscule, role in a Hollywood film.","There’s nothing quite like listening to a director talk passionately about his own film. The bonus material in the DVD of The Great Gatsby is a 13-minute featurette that has director Baz Luhrmann talk about his choices and omissions regarding a few scenes that were deleted from the final film. What it did most for me was make me desperately want to revisit the film as well as the book – that’s usually the sign of true love and understanding that a director has for his craft.The film itself, I thought, makes for a better DVD watch if you’ve already watched it on the big screen and were slightly disappointed by it. The 3D is gone, the Luhrmann-esque grandiosity assumes smaller dimensions on a smaller screen, and you can focus a wee bit more on the core of the film – Jay Gatsby and his love for the only true love of his life.Now if only studios and DVD manufacturers would specifically start designing DVDs keeping the Indian market in mind, vis-à-vis languages, subtitles and even packaging. Surely, we’re a large enough market to deserve it!Grandiose, colourful, an orgy of vivid imagery and music, Baz Luhrmann’s big screen adaptation of The Great Gatsby is often wondrous to look at, but lacks what it should have had the most – a gut-wrenching soul. That isn’t to say that the film is unwatchable; but even as a cinematic work independent of the novel it is based on, the film shows far too much promise to be failing as much and as often as it does.The narrative voice-over must be one of the big dilemmas of cinema. Fundamentally uncinematic because of its very nature – if you are going to dictate something, then why have visuals at all – fact remains that some of the most enduring classics through the years have used voice-overs, and they’ve used them well. A quick skim through F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel ‘The Great Gatsby’, on which Baz Luhrmann’s latest film is based, will tell you that considering the style of the book, the film would have to heavily rely on a voice-over to tell its tale.A part of me was secretly hoping that Luhrmann would be able to side-step this and bring what I consider an absolute epic – even though I read the book for the first time only a day before I watched the film – to life. Unfortunately, he does exactly what was expected; in fact, the opening lines of the film (voice-over, of course) have been taken from the book verbatim. By no means is the use of a voice-over the biggest problem with the film though.The film is narrated by Nick Carraway, a World War I veteran who is now back in New York, who recounts his experiences with one Mr. Gatsby, an enigmatic man who everyone seems to know of, but no one really knows. A film that is, at its heart, a story of enduring love and the sheer power that such love holds within itself, the competent ensemble cast keeps things at least marginally interesting all through the film. However, the film’s big failure is that it just doesn’t touch you, considering the emotional heft that the story in itself has.Luhrmann displays a remarkable command over the medium, playing with it visually as well as aurally, succeeding in developing a fairly interesting narrative method. He also recreates not just the period that the film is set in, but the environment and feel that of the novel as well. The film also has a terrific soundtrack, one that focuses more on the mood and the emotions than on any sort of faithfulness to the era in which it is set.However, while the 3D of the film isn’t visually poor as is usually the case, I fail to see the point of shooting this film in 3D. If anything, this film is hampered by the 3D more than most other films, because the glasses almost act like a barrier between the audience and the characters. At the heart of the epic-like exterior lies a core of pure love, one that deserved to be laid out for the audience without having additional encumbrances as distractions. The 3D is a poor technical choice (quite understandable though, considering Luhrmann’s background in theatre and the larger-than-life manner in which he usually treats his films.)As I said earlier, the one thing that kept me continuously interested in the film were the performances; while Tobey Maguire as the narrator Nick Carraway is functional – he seems to be getting distinctly repetitive in his expressions, delivery and posture lately – the supporting cast comprising of Joel Edgerton and Carrey Mulligan, who play the husband-wife pair of Tom and Daisy Mulligan, are terrific, as is Jason Clarke in a tiny little role. Edgerton, in particular, is such a fine actor that it seems like a terrible waste that he doesn’t have more films written specifically for him. Amitabh Bachchan’s appearance is expectedly brief, and watching him on the big screen with another of my favourite actors – who

351,449,449,449,449,Great Grand Masti,Not rated by wogma,Preview27 Critic Reviews 0.3/5.0 1 Reader Review 0/5.0,/movie/great-gatsby-review/,0.3/5.0,0/5.0,,3.6,"Eye-candy but rarely more, Baz Luhrmann’s The Great Gatsby joins the list of screen adaptations that fail to match up to their literary counterparts. Good performances don’t succeed in elevating the film to where it truly deserved to be, considering the richness of the source. You won’t miss much if you skip the film, though you probably wouldn’t mind giving it a shot if you’ve read and loved the book, or if you’re desperate to see Amitabh Bachchan in his first, albeit miniscule, role in a Hollywood film.","There’s nothing quite like listening to a director talk passionately about his own film. The bonus material in the DVD of The Great Gatsby is a 13-minute featurette that has director Baz Luhrmann talk about his choices and omissions regarding a few scenes that were deleted from the final film. What it did most for me was make me desperately want to revisit the film as well as the book – that’s usually the sign of true love and understanding that a director has for his craft.The film itself, I thought, makes for a better DVD watch if you’ve already watched it on the big screen and were slightly disappointed by it. The 3D is gone, the Luhrmann-esque grandiosity assumes smaller dimensions on a smaller screen, and you can focus a wee bit more on the core of the film – Jay Gatsby and his love for the only true love of his life.Now if only studios and DVD manufacturers would specifically start designing DVDs keeping the Indian market in mind, vis-à-vis languages, subtitles and even packaging. Surely, we’re a large enough market to deserve it!Grandiose, colourful, an orgy of vivid imagery and music, Baz Luhrmann’s big screen adaptation of The Great Gatsby is often wondrous to look at, but lacks what it should have had the most – a gut-wrenching soul. That isn’t to say that the film is unwatchable; but even as a cinematic work independent of the novel it is based on, the film shows far too much promise to be failing as much and as often as it does.The narrative voice-over must be one of the big dilemmas of cinema. Fundamentally uncinematic because of its very nature – if you are going to dictate something, then why have visuals at all – fact remains that some of the most enduring classics through the years have used voice-overs, and they’ve used them well. A quick skim through F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel ‘The Great Gatsby’, on which Baz Luhrmann’s latest film is based, will tell you that considering the style of the book, the film would have to heavily rely on a voice-over to tell its tale.A part of me was secretly hoping that Luhrmann would be able to side-step this and bring what I consider an absolute epic – even though I read the book for the first time only a day before I watched the film – to life. Unfortunately, he does exactly what was expected; in fact, the opening lines of the film (voice-over, of course) have been taken from the book verbatim. By no means is the use of a voice-over the biggest problem with the film though.The film is narrated by Nick Carraway, a World War I veteran who is now back in New York, who recounts his experiences with one Mr. Gatsby, an enigmatic man who everyone seems to know of, but no one really knows. A film that is, at its heart, a story of enduring love and the sheer power that such love holds within itself, the competent ensemble cast keeps things at least marginally interesting all through the film. However, the film’s big failure is that it just doesn’t touch you, considering the emotional heft that the story in itself has.Luhrmann displays a remarkable command over the medium, playing with it visually as well as aurally, succeeding in developing a fairly interesting narrative method. He also recreates not just the period that the film is set in, but the environment and feel that of the novel as well. The film also has a terrific soundtrack, one that focuses more on the mood and the emotions than on any sort of faithfulness to the era in which it is set.However, while the 3D of the film isn’t visually poor as is usually the case, I fail to see the point of shooting this film in 3D. If anything, this film is hampered by the 3D more than most other films, because the glasses almost act like a barrier between the audience and the characters. At the heart of the epic-like exterior lies a core of pure love, one that deserved to be laid out for the audience without having additional encumbrances as distractions. The 3D is a poor technical choice (quite understandable though, considering Luhrmann’s background in theatre and the larger-than-life manner in which he usually treats his films.)As I said earlier, the one thing that kept me continuously interested in the film were the performances; while Tobey Maguire as the narrator Nick Carraway is functional – he seems to be getting distinctly repetitive in his expressions, delivery and posture lately – the supporting cast comprising of Joel Edgerton and Carrey Mulligan, who play the husband-wife pair of Tom and Daisy Mulligan, are terrific, as is Jason Clarke in a tiny little role. Edgerton, in particular, is such a fine actor that it seems like a terrible waste that he doesn’t have more films written specifically for him. Amitabh Bachchan’s appearance is expectedly brief, and watching him on the big screen with another of my favourite actors – who

352,450,450,450,450,[The] Green Hornet,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/green-hornet-review/,,3/5.0,,3.3,"The Green Hornet is the movie you should go and watch if you don’t mind watching a senseless but fun flick. But if you would even try to make any sort of sense out of the movie, you’re in for a huge disappointment. The movie is inspired from the radio show and a TV series by the same name. But unlike them, it fails to live up to its potential. With names like Christoph Waltz, Seth Rogen and Cameron Diaz involved, you want it to be so much more than it actually is. Its still quite enjoyable to watch for its cranky humor and sleek action sequences. ","The Green Hornet was a radio show back in 1930s, which later translated into a comic book series, a television series and now a movie. When a concept has been working well for the audiences in so many variants for decades, you’d think its real hard to screw that up now with all the technology at your disposal. This film almost manages to amaze you by doing just that. ‘Almost’ being the key-word here, as its still a good fun-filled mindless action movie, but nowhere near as awesome as the other forms of the franchise. After The Incredibles, there have been plenty of flicks that have experimented with the superhero concept. Some have been successful (Kick-Ass, Megamind, etc) while others have miserably failed (Epic Movie, Underdog, etc). The Green Hornet lies somewhere in between because it has Seth Rogen as Brett Reid, a.k.a The Green Hornet, as the egocentric cocky billionaire with daddy issues and a hero complex (sounds familiar?) who fits into your pop-culture superhero perfectly; and on the other hand you have Jay Chou as Kato, his faithful partner, who does all the hard-work from kicking the bad guys to building weapons, cars, coffee-machines, pretty much everything as if he was born to be a superhero. An idiot with a big mouth and a kung-fu god, has been a trusted formula for success but it falls a little short for this film. A very mundane screenplay and under-utilization of the actors is to blame.Seth Rogen is the lead actor, writer and producer for the film. And with great power, comes greater screen-time. He is all over the movie. I like Seth Rogen, I do, but when you have an immensely talented actor like Christoph Waltz and a looker like Cameron Diaz on your team, you ought to give them time to shine too. Cameron is totally wasted in the film with very little screen time for her to do anything meaningful. She makes most of what she’s got though. Christoph Waltz is the reason, I insist you watch the film rather than just let it go. The guy is a powerhouse of talent. He’s done an excellent job at being the self-conscious psychopathic crime boss. For me, the most memorable scene of the movie is between him and James Franco in his cameo (another very talented guy). If only James had a longer role, this movie would have done wonders. Jay Chou had Bruce Lee’s shoes to fill in, who played Kato in the television series. Needless to say they are pretty-darn big and near impossible shoes to fill in. He does a respectable job though, and is awesome in action sequences. But I’m so not a fan of the red-eye thing they’ve inserted in every action sequence. Sometimes technology works against you. Michel Gondry (director) could have done a much better job. Music score of the film is great. Soundtrack had many songs I grew up listening to.Its a good action flick with enough comic moments to satisfy you. But has nothing much to remember it by. Watch on DVD for sure.

353,451,451,451,451,Green Lantern,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review3 Reader Reviews 1/5.0,/movie/green-lantern-review/,,1/5.0,,2.3,"Green Lantern is your regular super-hero film. A common man realizes he has special powers and automatically rises to the occasion to save the universe from collapsing. The graphics - you’ve seen before, thanks to the number of action movies releasing on 3D over the past few months. The storyline you’ve heard before and therefore, the movie watching experience – might just lead to a bad case of déjà vu. ","There are two kinds of predictability – the enjoyable-guesses kind and the don’t-need-to-hold-your-breath-what’s-the-point-anyway kind. The former can be applied to thrillers where you know the killer’s going to be the unsuspecting face around the protagonist but with enough background music, you’ll still be shocked off your socks during the climax. The latter is the worst kind – and Green Lantern, the newest superhero film adaptation, is presumptuously predictable. Based on the famous DC comic series, Green Lantern is about a group of saviors and chosen ones with the responsibility to save the universe. The Green Lantern Corps defeated the fearful antithesis, Parallax, many years ago and imprisoned him in an abandoned sector. He escapes, to create havoc among the universe when the strongest of all Green Lanterns, Abin Sur vows to choose his worthy successor from Planet Earth. Enter Hal Jordon (Ryan Renolds) and does he save the day? Take a wild guess. It’s a majestic set-up; one that requires you to have read the comic before watching the film, but one of the biggest problems with Green Lantern is that it doesn’t spend time trying to explain the backdrop to the uninitiated. By this, almost half the audience sitting in the theatre hall felt isolated. The movie waltzed in as a Matrix-cum-Captain Planet hangover and, until the end credits, remains just that. Those who have read the comics might feel differently, but any adaptation must at least spend a good amount of screen time establishing the characters and relevant contexts. Green Lantern is stylish, but nothing you haven’t seen before. The graphics are slick, Ryan Renolds looks quite super-hero like in the film, but it’s the yawn- inducing predictability of the story that makes the whole experience a dull one. You could walk out for some popcorn and walk back to have not missed much. And that’s an anecdote attached to prime time soap operas. Director Micheal Campbell’s Casino Royale was much more stylish, slicker and engaging. While watching the film you’ll wonder how he shifted from a fast-paced, drool-worthy Bond film to a commercial, stereotypical Green Lantern. In Green Lantern, you will find that you can’t relate to the protagonist, no matter how good he looks. The staple characters -the girlfriend, the sidekick and the bad guy from within - are all stereotypes, waiting to be overpowered by our protagonist but you don’t feel grand at his victory or frightened at the possible downfall of the world.  There are a few funny dialogues, some scenes that will make you wide-eyed but there are only so many flying objects you can take through your dim 3D glasses before a splitting headache. Green Lantern is not a bad film; it’s just not as challenging or inspiring as a super hero film should be. You would be better off buying the video game, because the film doesn’t look or emote any differently. Even better? Wait for it to premiere on Cartoon Network on a Sunday afternoon.

You'll root for these guys like you've never done before.","There is something so exciting and intriguingly gargantuan about the thought of the shared cinematic universe that Kevin Feige and his team at Marvel Studios bring to us every year. It almost seems like an alternate reality, one worth surrendering to.So far, we've been exposed to the top rung of the Marvel line-up, and they've mostly been fun, and have rarely, if ever, been completely disappointing. With James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy, we're introduced to a ragtag bunch of obscure Marvel characters, which was always going to be a risky proposition for the studio. Yet, what is undoubtedly the first of an exciting series of films, does what few expected of it - it is easily the most fun Marvel film since The Avengers. A franchise that could just be the definitive 'Space Western' of this generation, Guardians is thrilling, exciting, inspiring and funny, all in equal measure. The characters are, for want of a better word, a bunch of losers. Individually, their primary concerns are about money or survival. In the larger scheme of things, these concerns seem almost banal. Yet, when these motley characters get together, they become the unlikely eponymous group from the title.More importantly, when they come together, they just seem to have smashing good fun, which rubs off on to the audience. So utterly beautiful it is, the fact that despite the film being set in what feels like the coldest reaches of outer space, our heroes ooze warmth when they're with each other. Not that they're always on friendly terms - but then as they get to know each other better, we get to know them better.Peter Quill, who likes calling himself Star-Lord even if no one else does; the mysterious and slinky assassin Gamora; Rocket the talking raccoon; Groot the humanoid tree; and the sinewy beast Drax; there really couldn't have been a more diverse set of characters thrown into the mix. Their zaniness is perhaps their biggest strength - no one in their right minds would ever take this lot seriously.The plot, like every Marvel film really, is about an evil being, hunting for something that can help him gain power. Here, it's Ronan and Thanos. (The latter, if you remember, made the briefest of appearances in the mid-closing credits scene of The Avengers.) Even though our heroes never quite seem to wrap their heads around it, they are drawn into a bid to foil these evil designs.Yes, there are the impressive set pieces. Yes, the CG and VFX in the film are top notch. But the film primarily works because it is a buddy movie. Our characters are hilarious, and theirs is a coming-of-age tale, with awkward righteousness guiding them in their goal. The dialogues are spontaneously top-notch, and the film has the most dissonant soundtrack one could imagine for a film of this genre, but one that works because of sheer nostalgia. Peter Quill is the only human character in the entire film, so he's obviously the only one for whom music works like magic - evoking memories of a world gone by. Chris Pratt as Quill has a rakish charm about him. Zoe Saldana is fine as Gamora, and it's great to see Dave Bautista actually hold his own as Drax. Perhaps not a victim of a strong previous image like Dwayne Johnson, it is much easier to accept Bautista as an actor. But the most laughs are provided by Rocket and Groot, who are voiced by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel respectively. I've personally always been fascinated by the character of Thanos, so it was good to see Josh Brolin bring him to performance-captured life.Guardians is easily the best studio offering of the summer, and it is a worthy addition to the Marvel line up. Things are only going to get bigger from here, because clearly, they have at least some percentage of a plan.

It had all the jokes you wanted, and more. It had Drax’s stupid laugh. It had Chris Pratt being Chris Pratt, and best of all: It had Baby Groot. A wonderful plot, and full of great visuals, it’s perfect to watch in the theatres.","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a fun, and action-packed movie that wants to be tense. The only reason it’s not tense is because up until now, all the heroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) are practically indestructible. However, this tiny detail does not stop the movie from being an absolute blast. The movie is very much like the first installment in the sense that the jokes are all extremely funny, and not slap-stick, fart and poop jokes. This movie will certainly make you laugh out loud starting from an amused chuckle to hysterical shrieks of laughter.However story-wise, It’s not like the first movie. The story is very different from anything in the MCU, and I loved that. It’s original and funny at the same time. The director (James Gunn) once again shows that he can make a comedy with heart, and action at the same time. When Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) and his friends, the Guardians of the Galaxy, meet with Quill’s father, Ego (Kurt Russel), they are taken to a planet owned by him, but Gamora (Zoe Saldana) feels something is wrong. With the theme of family at its heart, the story is about the difference between a Father and a Dad. That part of the film seems extremely cliché, but it shows us the what it means to be of family. Not just a group of friends who have been together for a long enough time to basically be siblings like most movies, but a group of friends that are constantly fighting with each other, everybody wanting their own way. Anyone who’s been a sibling knows of that fight about who gets to control the T.V. remote.  Guardians of the Galaxy is basically that, only it's  a spaceship instead of a television.The visuals are outstanding. James Gunn made the deep, vast expanse of Space colourful, which properly describes the tone of the movie as our heroes go through a very dark storyline telling jokes all the way.All the performances are brilliant. The jokes are told at exactly the right moments and in exactly the right manner. Drax (Dave Bautista) repeatedly did an extremely loud, goofy laugh, that made my day. The one other performance I would like to emphasize is Vin Diesel's as Baby Groot. If you've watched his other movies, you'd know that Vin Diesel has a gravelly, growling voice, which he uses for Groot in the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie perfectly. However, Baby Groot has a high-pitched, baby voice, and I was surprised as to how well it worked out for the movie.You have to watch it of course, but here's something more to look forward to. Stick around until the very end of the credits. Do not leave the theater (or turn off the DVD) until the screen goes black. There are a handful post-credit scenes.

An overwhelming sense of wanting to send a social message, even if understandable, doesn't help the cause.","Guddu Rangeela carries the weight of being a “message” film while the thriller elements had it going for the film quite well. It has been a while since I have seen a Hindi film that corners the protagonists and the antagonist in turns, well enough to make you worry/be happy. Unfortunately,  this doesn't stay through the end and Guddu Rangeela becomes like any other Hindi film.I understand the issue of honor killing is an important one and cannot have enough awareness in the hope that something is done about it soon. In fact, it is such a serious issue that maybe it is impossible to write a story about it without coming across heavily as trying to say something other than just a story. That then, becomes jarring after a while.It doesn't help that except for the few unexpected twists in the film, the writing lets you down. At many points, the film seems like it is dragging with a song or a joke added. Almost as if it knows it has gotten too serious and needs to lighten up. This in turn looks as forced as it is. Also, while the attempt is to keep the look and feel of the film authentic, a story like this would never have happened in real life. It is not even about the over-simplistic narrative. It is one of those films that asks you not to think too much. The accents too are overtly rural and inconsistent. It felt like the actors slipped into the dialect when they remembered or were reminded to do so, else it slipped by. The actors all do alright. Nothing too great is asked of them and none is delivered. Even so, Ronit Roy shines. He is one villain who gives me the shivers, even if it is the first time he is on screen in the film – invariably he is playing a character who you have to be wary of – ruthless.A heinous villain and a few     smart plot twists though aren't good enough to take you to the theater, though, right?

","If it were not as expected, Gulaab Gang would have been disappointing. So, as the trailer pointed out, the film is one dramatic scene after another without respite. The drama is magnified by Madhuri Dixit's emphatic dialogue delivery and Juhi Chawla's drawl. The latter actually grows on you in a bit. Juhi Chawla's Sumitra is as cunning as every second politician and the actor makes it very easy for you to hate her. Juhi Chawla is at her best when she is required to portray Sumitra's fickle ego. Unfortunately, Madhuri Dixit's character, Rajjo Devi is directed in such a way that she has no option but to play her character with extra style, even if she is from a little village. Once you get over it though, you see that Madhuri Dixit has tried hard to work in variety within the restraints of the many slow-motion sequences and forced, strong one-liners.It is a shame then, that despite these one-liners, the film lacks punch. There are few side characters that retain interest but then again, they are more or less clones of each other with respect to in their personalities. The writing of the overall film takes the audience's need for justice for women for granted. Right from the titles, you are never given enough cause to side with the gang of women who take justice in  their hands. It is assumed that you know how bad the wrong by the wrong-doers is. Given that, any punishment the Gulaab Gang decides for them is also to be accepted as apt. Moving on, the situations created seem disjointed. It feels more like sequences were conceptualized independently and fit in together forcefully. For example, the sub-plots used to display Sumitra's borderline megalomaniac personality go overboard within the context of the film. Thus losing out on both an awesome dark character that she could be and building a really powerful story to justify these intense sub-plots. Then all you are left with are the vibrant songs. Here I concede, to watch Madhuri Dixit dance, I don't need any context to see grace and elegance incarnate. And this when she's not even at her best. She must be the only actress who actually dances. As opposed to other actors who have the potential to convert even the most melodious of songs to an aerobic beat. Even so, it is disservice to the topic at hand - empowerment of the women and poor from the interiors of the country, if one of the major things I take away from the film are its (not the best) dance sequences.

What more could a thinking brain ask for? Sure, there'll be nits to be picked but while walking out I just wanted to savor the experience.","Honestly, I'd be more than happy to have a one-line review here saying - ""Go watch the movie! Period."" But that would be a lazy woman at work. It's always difficult to point a finger at what you liked in a movie. It also sort-of takes away from the experience by intellectualizing and breaking down something that you enjoyed as a whole. But you gotta do what you gotta do, so here goes. When the opening credits begin a few minutes into the movie, I was shocked to realize - not once in those 3-4 minutes did it cross my mind that I was actually listening to a character give a political, inspirational speech. The visuals of those were so engaging and Kay Kay Menon's expressions so intense that they completely occupied my senses. For a person who gets bored very easily by monologues that even remotely sound like lectures, this was one big score on the positive side. The effort spent on casting showed in every pick and they performed well too. To name one would be to do injustice to the other and the list is really long. The women might seem a bit off because of their eccentricities but then again that might have been very intentional because they are not your regular 'miss goody two shoes' women-next-door. And the positives only grew in number after that. Sure there's politics, and there's an undercurrent of romance. But there's a lot more happening underneath. There's dissatisfaction everywhere. The entire chain of power from the fieldworker to the henchmen to the puppet-leader to the chief strategist wants to exude confidence, power and smart-Alecness till the next person higher up comes in. Each one wants to claim superiority and find someone to pull down. Now, this is as true in state politics as it is in home or office politics. There are many more subtle things which only a second or third viewing can uncover but you somehow sense their existence. And there are of course, what I call the director's eccentricities like the blue-and-red man and the flautist. Then there's this strong sexual and gender-bias flittering around in this ecosystem. Though Anurag's women all seem to have a fierce sensuousness about them, they don't seem unreal and neither does it seem out-of-place, forced, contrived or any such thing. This I need to mention because I very liberally label an unnecessary expression of sexuality 'gratuitous'. I always get apprehensive when I begin looking forward to a movie. The last thing anyone should do to themselves is spoil their experience because of their own expectations. But, one thing we can safely look forward to with a Anurag Kashyap film now is awesome and novel music, even better lyrics and perfect use of the compositions. Too many words to describe something that one needs to get completely absorbed and soaked in. Let me just stop writing here, so you can stop reading and go watch the movie.

As we get acquainted with the organization and its charismatic leader Sampat Pal, the film also inspires us to stand for a change.","Women are ill-treated, disrespected and discriminated against the world over. But in the rural heartland of India, this problem exists at a whole different level. A woman is considered worthless, a burden, a being whose existence is divided into two truths - either uphold 'family honour' or die.How hard must it be, then, to stand up and fight for the cause of women in a society like this? Sampat Pal, the woman behind Gulabi Gang - an organization that has gone on to receive international recognition - is a shining example of a woman choosing to empower herself and others like her, because society doesn't deem her equal to men.Nishtha Jain's documentary on Sampat Pal and her organization is an eye-opening piece of work. It brings into focus what we've only heard or read about so far - just how truly helpless a woman can be in the interiors of India. Yet, it also serves as an inspiration, not just to women like those we see in the film, but to all of us. It reminds us that standing for a just cause needs courage and vision.Sampat Pal anchors the film, as we follow her around while she holds public gatherings, recruitment drives and personally delves into the burning and subsequent death of a young woman. The film looks at the last of those in great detail, almost with the pensive inquisitiveness of a murder mystery, before we realize that this is just one of the myriad frustrating tales of the life of a woman being taken for granted.Despite the hope the film gives, however, there is also the sense of what a mountain this battle of changing societal mindset is. A majority of the women themselves believe that a woman doesn't have the option of choosing to live her life the way she wants; they still believe that a woman who has fallen in love has besmirched the family's honour. You know the problem is serious when even a Gulabi Gang member of many years still feels the same.Sampat Pal has a powerful, charismatic presence. With a sprinkling of light moments, she ensures that the film maintains a brisk pace throughout, bringing us face to face with a bunch of people who are victims of the malaise that eats our society from within, as well as those who dare to stand up for change.Each face in the film has character. The sight of the army of pink, trooping away for a cause with lathis in their hands; dangerously treading on the toes of the law but doing it with the weight of conviction against all odds; Gulabi Gang has an intriguing story that must be known.

The pace is a mismatch of skipping a good deal of build up, and stretching the emotions a little too much. Unconvincing and unfunny, this film should not be chosen even if someone gave you money to go watch.","All of us have read the book, and I had loved it. That was because it led me through a lot of detailed voyages and outings of one Gulliver, and how his trip changed into a total adventure. This movie is a modern take on the same lines, only it's silly and boring. A common mail room man who goes to Bermuda for an assignment looses his way. He is a guy who is in the need of an ego boost, and ends up being the tallest man in a strange land of Lilliput. Oh and how he loves it, until something goes wrong. Add to that a little spice, because our guy is a simple jack who is good at heart and wants to help everyone. This movie is obviously about “Every dog has his day” and how you can make your day just by being confident.The story focuses mainly on Gulliver’s adventure to Lilliput where the people are one-twelfth his size. Then there is a cameo at Brobdingnag, where people are twelve times the size of humans, and Gulliver has to live as a doll. Lack of right pace in the story puts this movie in the “far below expectations” list that I have. They rush through the build up, and prolong the twilight talks – I so don’t categorize as adventurism. Jack Black was okay in his role, and definitely not as original as he was in School of Rock. Speaking of original, I think everything and everyone in the film was an imitation. Even Emily Blunt, who was cast as Princess Mary, seemed to be to fake – even as a blonde! But at the top was the direction, which did a really unintelligent imitation of a great story. It felt miserable to see one of my favorite books turn into bits and pieces of non-performance. Back to acting, the Lilliputian that Gulliver befriends in his initial days as a prisoner, Horatio – done right by Jason Segal, still refrains from playing an honest and convincing role. Sure they induced good stuff, like references to Titanic and Gavatar. But the film fails as a comedy, or even as a children’s adventure. It is shot unrealistically. I mean, Jajantaram-Mamantaram was better! The 3D feels like a desperate attempt to attract audiences. Most of it is obviously shot with green screens.. And oh, how could I forget to mention the feeble attempt at humor… a serious put off! I almost went to sleep in the movie.  Children might see if they want, but would be better off if they did not.

It's made to look so fickle in Gunday that you feel nothing for any of the characters or their relationships. And love of course, is superficial. In any case, love drama, friendship melodrama, and a few abuses directed towards the ""system"" later, Gunday is spread too thin on an already flimsy plot line. Gunday is one of those films that make you wonder why it was made at all. The action is plain and pretty much boring. The performances are overtly stylish and overbearing. The dialogue delivery by one and all is too focussed on making an impact without having any support from the dialogue itself. The writing is so predictable that even if you haven't seen the trailer you can tell what's going to happen next. If you've seen the trailer, that's pretty much all you need to know. It is a shudder-worthy shame that this story about friendship nods its hat to Sholay. Given all these aspects, you could keep yourself from blaming the cast. Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor flare their nostrils appropriately and seem to have worked extra hard on moving their lips to indicate impact and energy. There is a one off scene each for Ranveer Singh and Priyanka Chopra which gives them room to let go of the forced style and actually emote. As one would expect, it is too little and too late. DO NOT get me started on how Irrfan Khan is wasted here. A little too late also comes the courtesy mumbo-jumbo about how the protagonists do what they do because of the ""system"". That is a tough one to sell, given their attitude from when they were shown as 12-13 year olds. The only silver lining is that the first half is reasonably well-paced. There was also this flicker of a comment on how best friends can take each other for granted, but as the movie progressed, it felt like only I saw it. But, other than that Gunday is as mediocre as it gets.But then again, what do you expect from a film that has characters grow up from being children to adults with the camera on their running feet only to break into a song introducing themselves. Or a film that has too many themes and doesn't take a single one seriously - love, friendship, angst against system.

On the contrary, there are some scenes in which Abhishek Bachchan (Guru) looks border-line ugly. What you will get though is some outstanding performances. True, the anti-climatic end disappoints. But, fortunately, it’s the end; you have already enjoyed two hours of an overall fine product.In Hindi cinema, a lot of the credit goes to the director when almost all the actors give great performances. This is, arguably, one of the finest performances Abhishek Bachchan has given. Many people who were struggling in the 70s and 80s will identify with Guru’s ambitions, and how he is pulled down by most people around him. The audience grows with the character…and so does his belly. The success of many movies, in this day and age, depends a lot on “cute dimples” and “wow! What muscles!”. It takes tremendous courage for a leading star to gain so much weight and get rid of  the “sexy stubble” because the character needs it. Remember that's not make-up, that is actual flab, which he will have to lose soon enough.Mithun Chakraborty makes you wish that he had acted like this in his times. R. Mahadevan looks extremely comfortable in the shoes of a journalist and Vidya Balan moves you to tears even though her character has had just 4-5 scenes to develop. The only actor that sticks out with a mediocre performance was Aishwarya Rai. All she needed to do was to dance and look pretty. Though she looks her usual dainty self, somehow her dance had a very “1-2-3-change” feel. The very little acting she needed to do, came across as mechanical. Guru does not have an earth-shattering story, which is what makes the movie look real. But, it does have a few glaring loopholes with gaps in the plot and thus leaves the audience with questions. E.g., the audience is not told the exact manner in which Guru succeeds. Abhishek and Aishwarya switch in and out of the Gujrati accent and the lack of continuity is obvious. Also, cinematic liberty has been taken while handling technical medical issues of certain characters. All of which could have been forgiven had the climax had impact. It is a shame that a director of this caliber could not resist evoking the demon of melodrama in the last twenty minutes. The whole treatment of the climax looks very out-of-place and surreal. Nevertheless, the outstanding cinematography, the very believable dialogues, the foot-tapping music, and of course the outstanding performances make Guru worth a visit to the cinema halls.

And every once in a while the thought is punctuated by the passing away of an ""aged"" person. People might not say it out loud, but that death comes as a relief - not only to the person who dies. Old age with ailments is not anything anyone looks forward to. ""Please don’t let me live on like a vegetable,"" is something I hear from friends a lot more than I’d like, even though it’s only a casual remark. But, what if, you don’t have to wait for old age for this to happen. What if you are hit with this situation in your prime? That’s what happens to Ethan (Hrithik Roshan) in Guzaarish. And Sanjay Leela Bhansali paints such a beautiful picture to bring across the pathos that you almost ignore how silly the basic plot is. The picture is beautiful not only because you can see the thought gone into composing each frame; but also because the writing has a lot of restraint. Ethan doesn’t go into a spiel demanding our sympathy. He gains it because of the situations he’s in. From the fly he can’t shoo off to the anger he can’t vent out physically, make you feel for his despair. Of course, they had to mess it up in the end but then again, that scene becomes tolerable because it hasn't been used earlier. Yes, it has all the emotional triggers, visually, in speech and in music. Well, it's supposed to be an emotional scene, after all. And Hrithik Roshan had to get the promised amount of screen time, right?But he, more or less, pulls it off. Often, his head dropped to one side like a mentally imbalanced person - while this got annoying, at other times he showed an unexpected degree of talent. Including the times he got angry.

She is breathtakingly beautiful. So perfect, that I can understand when I hear people say, ""she is so beautiful that it's difficult to like her."" That doesn't make the statement fair, but then again, it's unfair for someone to look divine too. (Sorry for this side, but throughout the film I was reminded of this comment on Guru's review where the commenter mentioned his servant looked better than Aishwary Rai, I guess Ethan can't even say that.)I admit, I didn't expect anything in the form of acting from anyone in this film. And I admit, I was mildly surprised. Let alone Ms. Rai Bachchan hell, even Nafisa Ali had a bit of voice modulation going around. I still have to get past Aditya Roy Kapoor's cute smile to decide if I really like his acting or not, but so far so good. He has a refreshing air about him. A bunch of other characters do their bit. And that's my grouse. Almost all of them come in the second half. I for one, get unsettled when characters and the base plot are set and then a new character is introduced, let alone 4-5 new ones. Sure, they were there for a purpose. But an ever-lasting introduction to characters, especially when the conflict comes in the first 10 minutes, threw the story structure off the chart. I love experimentation, especially with narrative styles, but this entry and exit of character after character looked like the writers were filling in blanks, ""Oye, we need a love interest. Hey, what about family? Hey, where did the enemy go? Oops, we forgot to give Sophia (Aishwarya) a backstory. And so on and on."" And all leading to what?

His fight seems futile and to an extent the film too.But, the point is that, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's intentions are clear from the first shot - one lyrical movement by Aishwarya even if it is something as mundane as drawing curtains. You know he's aiming for his brand of grandeur. (And he'll to stick that one grand set, even if the Indian Judiciary system has to shift address.) You know his purpose is to enchant with visuals. And that he does. He doesn't want anything close to real. Somewhere along the side he wants to say a story, but I guess, he must know too, that the plot is not his priority. So, he succeeds there too. It's just that it didn't work for me in entirety.Meanwhile, it does create empathy.

To have it portrayed in mainstream cinema is a necessity. To have it so beautifully adapted into a Shakespearean tragedy is a luxury I couldn't have imagined possible. For if there is a land that is free yet imprisoned like Hamlet describes, Kashmir would be one of the top contenders. The rest of the departments are so dedicated to the topic and the play that they all fit like a jigsaw puzzle. After being enamored by the adaptation to Kashmir, the next thing that stuck me was Shahid Kapoor's performance. He stands tall bang in the middle of power house performers like Kay Kay Menon and Tabu, a feat that I never would have thought him to be capable of. Two sequences are stuck in my memory and I see myself forgiving him many Phata Poster Nikla Heros and R...Rajkumaars for those two sequences, one of which is actually a dance performance. Another scene that was completely taken over by an actor, unsurprisingly had Irrfan Khan. These sequences are lovely examples of all departments of film-making coming together in perfect synchronization - story writing, dialogue writing, scene (and dance) choreography, the setting and of course the performances. If there is a way to incorporate song and dance in a perfectly serious film, it is the way in which Haider's trick play was done. The graveyard song would have worked even better if only it flowed into the film a little more smoothly. Unfortunately, the way it is in the film, it seems a little abrupt instead of hitting hard the way it had potential to.Similarly, because the story is not all linear, the back and forth builds up well, but it also flattens a little before half-time. The pace is a little more uneven in the second half. But, these are minor quibbles very easily forgivable because of the dialogue, the performances and the beauty of Kashmir. It must be difficult to resist the temptation of setting the contrast of the gorgeousness of Kashmir against what man has made out of it. Blood and gore against the purity of white snow. And this is when the film is set in fall and winter, not even Kashmir in its spring. After having seen films week-after-week and knowing there are so many more to be seen out there, very few inspire you to watch it again. And even fewer because each department played its role very close to perfection. Vishal Bharadwaj's Haider is one of those rare ones. Yes, I will certainly watch this one again. Soon.

Barring a few sequences, the movie seems very superficial.","Political dramas need a strong message backed by some power-packed dialogues and situations. And this is in addition to the regular requirement of well-thought out characters and a crisp screenplay. Halla Bol instead, has a regular message packaged shabbily around lame dialogues and contrived situations. Moreover, you don't feel for the characters and the screenplay is tedious for almost all of the runtime.
My  biggest problem was with the writing. The transformations of characters seemed more convenient than believable. And this applied to not only individual characters but groups of people as well - say the media or the general pulse of the country's population. The many real-life references seemed like a list of people and situations in the industry that needed to be caricatured. Just for the sake of it, with no particular purpose in mind.The use of flashbacks in an attempt to create interest was a deterrent for me. For an already badly written character, unnecessary non-linearity in the first half just added to the lack of flow. Not to mention, right from the beginning the events seemed obligatory and rather superficial.  Each event was laboriously explained where subtle hints would have done the job much more effectively. There was ample scope for hard-hitting, forceful scenes but, except for two places, the opportunities were not utilized. Again, barring those couple of sequences, the dialogues were predictable. And on most occasions the predictability was because of the unnecessary pauses, which gave the audience time to think ahead of the lines. Many scenes were way too verbose. The few decent lines were also marred by very plain dialogue delivery. I attribute most of these flaws to the director. Because we have certainly seen much better performances from both Ajay Devgan and Vidya Balan, in similar roles. And while Pankaj Kapoor did a decent job, his character too became across as monotonous and one dimensional towards the end.Yet another issue with the writing was the pace. With particular distaste for too many camera movements and pacy editing, I never thought I'd ask for quicker cuts. But this one so badly needed it. The lingering camera became way too annoying and gave a feel of immaturity. And when the cameraman had fits of creativity, he took pretty shots and inserted them in the movie randomly.Again, brilliant occasions for compelling music and lyrics were taken over by dull, lackluster songs. The qawali was outright boring. The songs seemed to exist in the movie just because.30-40 minutes shorter, crisper dialogues, a better issue to address, and more thought into the flow of events might have made this a better movie. All-in-all loads of room for improvement in direction. The only reason not to completely trash the movie is that we have seen worse, much worse.

Now that you've read it, you can skip the film. It takes the romance out of pain in love. Could there be a worse crime? ","So much for expecting intense love because there is so much pain in the trailer. For films that make you look forward to them after the trailer, the least you can say is – all the good bits were in the trailer, leaving nothing new in the film. Hamar Adhuri Kahani gives you no such pleasure by making the intensity snicker-worthy and way too mushy for its own good.I'm no cynic. Hardly. But, I ain't being swept off the floor by over-dramatized, loud background music and filmy dialogue either. Even if it is being pretended to be said with the utmost sincerity and puppy eyes. The romantic in me needs to the story behind the sadness. I can't just be told “She's sad. He's sadder and oh he's saddest.” Mind you, these lines aren't being said by a voiceover, but by the characters themselves. Even if you don't hear it out loud it is like one character says to another after having heard of the latter's pain, “I see your tragedy and I raise you to my horrific past.” And guess what? You as an audience, never really get into the thick of the sadness. It takes the romance out of pain in love. Could there be a worse crime?Don't I need to see why Vasudha's (Vidya Balan) value system is so strongly ignited when what I know of her actually is that she doesn't believe in it? Don't I need to know why Aarav (Emraan Hashmi) thinks he is devoid of love and affection when what I see is a mother who loves him immensely? Well, even if I haven't been told the opposite, don't I need to be shown why Hari (Rajkummar Rao) is the hateful misogynist he is and yet claims to make the woman of his life so important that he manipulates his whole life around her? Not to mention, why are all of them martyrs? And where did all the feminism come from suddenly? The film was most certainly not about that. None of the failures above can be blamed on the actors. They all play sad to the best of their abilities. Their only fault might be that they create zero chemistry – of hatred or of love. But, I'd think the actors saw the film as a lost cause scene after scene and just couldn't muster the juice out. Be done with it – looks like their attitude towards the film - a sentiment echoed in the audience. I could sense, that the houseful 200-seater was waiting in anticipation for something to like about the film. I know I was. As one ridiculously mushy line followed the other, I picked on one that was said randomly by a side character and I will say that is my takeaway from the film. har naam pe nahi rukte,

We get a bonus! Wake Up Sid. But what didn't expect was it would become a Housefull. However, somewhere along the way, it has a few wonderful laughs that keep it light and breezy.Sure, Happy Bhag Jayegi has all the trappings of a typical romcom, that goes for the “chaotic lie-after-lie” brand of comedy. But some of its one-liners and situations make you giggle at the silliness. Surprisingly, there is some subtle humor too. Also, unexpected is the social commentary on parental pressure in the form of a parallel thread. Bilal Ahmed's (Abhay Deol) track grows on the side almost unnoticed. Only, when the other characters talk about it,do you realise that it is a major part of the film. While each individual element of the story, the romance, the comedy, the politics, the social message are beaten to death in films, this mixture kind of works. The last bit slapped on, in the form of slapstick, ruins it all. It is the things that you don't expect Happy Bhag Jayegi to do that make the film enjoyable. Some of the humor aside, they named a character Afridi and did not take potshots at the Pakistani cricketer! That must have required some restraint. What's more, Bilal's wife (Momal Sheikh) who could have been the stereotypical vamp, is constrained in her reactions and in fact very human. The performances were all convincing and entertaining. The comic timing, the littlest of change in body and facial expressions, were thoroughly enjoyable. It is quite an achievement for Jimmy Sheirgill to play the guy who always loses his bride-to-be, and yet be entertaining all over again.The music is good too. The songs for once don't seem intrusive, even if the background music weirdly guides you to laugh and stop. It is the chaos in end that just gets to you and brings the film crumbling down. It is as if you can see the writer's struggle with what they really want – a situational sense of humor verus what they think the audience wants – a slapstick.

An urban romcom that tries to get a grapple on love. It is charming in its own way, but ultimately ends up having very little more than a regular romedy, as it likes to call itself. ","Happy Ending is not a sex comedy after all, though its trailer tried its best in portraying itself as one. It is a regular rom-com that truly has its heart in trying to differentiate itself from others in its genre. It manages, even if only by a bit. Let's face it. The dynamics of relationships are changing. Love is no more as ""forever"" a thing as it used to be thought of as. More and more of today's urban youth believes in ""the one"" for them, at this current point, on this day, this part of life. Of course, I have no statistics, but this is the general perception I see from younger friends and family. And this is what both Yudi (Saif Ali Khan) and Aanchal (Ileana D'Cruz) experience and live by.Yes, it does sound cynical. What happens when two cynics who don't believe in ""happily ever after"" but are romantic and enthusiastic about relationships otherwise bump into each other? It's not they don't like relationships but both like retiring from them when it's at its peak, after the initial excitement, before the us become 'you' and 'me'. Maybe the excitement just lives on because both don't want it to end. Maybe they let it just be instead of tinkering around with it to make it ""work"".In this sense, Happy Ending is different. It is a romcom that makes you reconsider the basics, like say ""opposites attract"". Though you might not think to deeply about it. And that is because it tries to do a lot many other things. For one, it wants to make you laugh, which it manages a few times; some times out loud too. It wants you to go ""aawww"" and care for the characters, root for them to be together, even if they aren't too sure about it. This, by definitions of romcom, is fine. Then, Happy Ending tries to become more. It wants to point a finger at both the ""Star-driven"" Hindi film industry and it wants to nod a cynical smile at the parallel indie film ""hatke"" (different) movement in the industry. Some of these things work wonderfully, while others fall flat.Some of the one-liners are brilliant and will stay with me for a long, long time and I would love to watch them again in the given context. Also, Govinda does his exaggerated bit as a ""star"" who runs the show pretty well. Ileana D'Cruz is charming as usual yet, her expressions always come across as functional and self-conscious, thus never too convincing. Kalki Koechlin seems to be on repeat mode from her appropriately annoying role in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. You can say the same about Saif Ali Khan from the dozen films where he's played the city-bred non-commital lady-charmer. Except, when he shows up as his character, Yudi's alter ego. His accent, his demeanour, his attitude and his sense of responsibility towards Yudi keep you in splits while being perceptive and introspective.It is the times when the film self-references that it digs itself a hole. Films that are satirical of the film industry that they belong to cannot do the same things that they are being satirical about. If you are poking fun at films breaking into songs in a formulaic manner, you cannot yourself have songs as expected. Similarly, I have never been fond of films that remind you that you are watching a film. Happy ending does this by breaking the fourth wall every once in a while. Except for one time that Yudi's alter ego makes Yudi aware of the audience's existence, where it is done meaningfully, it is annoying. Yet, you have to give points to Happy Ending for at least trying to be different, even if not whole-heartedly.  There are a few points in the film where you catch yourself inadvertently thinking a little deeper about love and its place in our world today. For me, that by itself is an achievement. Sure, I might not need a film to get me thinking about love and relationships, but it feels good when one gets you to. Think about it, if everything around you is changing, if nothing is permanent, if the only constant in life is change, can love be permanent? The romantic in me wants to believe that the answer to be, ""yes, despite all odds yes."" But, I'm willing to hear a more contemporary side of the story, if someone tells it to me right.  Whether or not they have a happy ending.

370,468,468,468,468,Happy Feet 2,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/happy-feet-2-review/,,3/5.0,,3.233333333,"Happy Feet 2 is not nearly as charming as the original Happy Feet. In spite of some endearing characters, particularly Bill and Will the krill (voiced by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon), and the superb 3-D experience, the film is a tad too preachy for its own good. With too much packed into it, the film fails to generate that same happy feeling that one got after watching the first film. The witty dialogue and enjoyable animation make sure that the audience is never really bored, but the film falls way short of being a first-rate children’s film because of its jumbled central story.","Watching a tiny little girl reach out in glee at bubbles that are heading towards her is a joy that is special enough. But when this happens inside a darkened cinema hall and the tiny little girl is wearing 3-D glasses, the feeling is quite simply something else.George Miller’s Happy Feet 2, the sequel to the Academy Award-winning Happy Feet (also directed by Miller) is a fun children’s film that is immensely helped by the 3-D. In fact, not since Avatar has 3-D contributed so much to a film. At last, someone seems to have realized that if you don’t get the feeling that the characters and the action are right in front of you, there really isn’t a point in releasing the film in 3-D.Apart from the thoroughly enjoyable 3-D experience, the film is quite easily stolen by the Brad Pitt and Matt Damon-voiced characters Bill the Krill and Will the Krill. Though they aren’t the central characters in the film, the interwoven portions featuring these two Krill who ‘swim against the swarm’ are genuinely funny, with quirky and enjoyable animation. Their antics are often reminiscent of the legendary Scrat from the Ice Age series. The dialogue of the film is goofy and witty, particularly the portions involving Bill and Will. You can’t help but smile when Will rattles on about dancing providing ‘momentary relief from the existential terrors of existence’. However, the film is majorly let down by its central story about Mumble the Penguin (voiced by Elijah Wood) and his family. Not nearly as charming as the first film, Happy Feet 2 tries to pack in too much into too little time, ultimately making it seem like a mishmash of a number of animation films that have come out of Hollywood. While there are a host of endearing characters including Ramon, voiced excellently by Robin Williams and Sven, voiced by Hank Azaria, the plot of the film just doesn’t engage you enough to root for the central characters. Like the first film, this too is a musical, and there are a couple of well-crafted musical set pieces that are fun while they last. At the core of the film is a father-son story that feels quite unexplored. The film would have appealed far more if this core idea was used to anchor the film, instead of having a whole host of sub-plots that just deviate from what had the potential to be a heart-warming tale of a son who grows to respect his father for the man (or penguin) that he is. What really works against the film is that it packs in too many messages and tries too hard to convey these messages. Thus, the audience is repeatedly subjected to characters coming to terms with and accepting themselves for what they are, to the importance of family, to environmental messages and so on. No surprise then that the film ends up becoming a tad too preachy for its own good.  Ultimately, while the film is a fun watch for children and the 3-D is genuinely thrilling, how one wishes that the makers of the film had chosen to narrate a simpler, cleaner tale that would have genuinely ‘brought out our happy’.

371,469,469,469,469,Happy Go Lucky,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/happy-go-lucky-review/,,,,3.233333333,"You get caught in the web of Happy Go Lucky with the second scene itself. In it, Poppy, who plays the lead, finds out that her bicycle has been stolen. “Oh, no, I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye”, she says, in retaliation, and walks away with a smile. That’s Poppy for you, a Happy Go Lucky, cheerful woman. You are instantly drawn to her, and wonder how she stays so optimistic. Watch the film for a 2-hour course on how to believe good things exist. ","Oh how I lashed out at reviews that conveniently resorted to clichéd lines like, “feel good film”. I never understood it, and always thought there were better ways to describe a film. But like they say, Karma is a b****. A while ago, I randomly picked up British director Mike Leigh’s film, Happy Go Lucky on the recommendation of a friend. With Sally Hawkins in the lead (of Woody Allen’s Cassandra’s Dream fame), it seemed like a promising film about a jarringly positive and optimistic protagonist, Poppy. Lo and behold, my first thought was, “Wow, what a feel good film!” Sigh, such is life. Happy Go Lucky struck me because the film is just that – it’s not plot heavy at all. It’s just a film about a woman in her early thirties who lives an independent single life in London and is positive about most things. Simple? Double yes and very much endearing.It’s a harder role to play than say, Desdemona from Othello. She must be happy, cheerful, positive at all times in the film, as if the sun rose from within her body. She sifts through her job as an elementary teacher and not surprisingly she’s a delight with children. She shares a very comfortable relationship with her cynical roommate Zoe, and we are forced to see her life through the extremely cheerful glasses she thrusts in front of our eyes. The relevance of her character however comes through most once she starts taking driving lessons from Scott (Eddie Marson), a bitter, antisocial, conspiracy-spitting, absolute contrast to Poppy. It’s in their encounters that you truly enjoy the film, in its stripped down form. When you hear their conversations – him ranting about how everything is wrong with the world and her asking him to relax and live a little – you understand the dynamics of human identity. The credit of this mostly goes to Mike Leigh, for being able to show you different viewpoints in such a colorful way. The DVD of Happy Go Lucky includes a commentary from Mike Leigh, an 18-minute making-of featurette of the driving lesson scenes with Scott and Poppy. It’s a hilarious watch for the jokes and behind the scene commentary that Sally Hawkins provides -  makes you see a witty side of her in reality. It also includes a 27-minute interview with Mike Leigh where he talks about the characters, and who he envisioned to play to role of Poppy. While the film progresses you see Poppy go through some difficult relationships, and situations. And she does get reduced to silence and contemplation every now and then, but the idea of the film is to be able to let us ponder over our little complaints about insignificant issues. Alternatively, we have Poppy, who wears a grin in every scene and never loses hope. I know it’s easier portrayed on film than done, but to make a feel-good (gah!) film that can make you believe that you should adopt a refreshed perspective on life is not easy. It’s not a simple road; this optimism. Infact, it’s rather brave to make a film about it, at the risk of being criticized for being ignorant, unreal and the works. Speaks volumes about Mike Leigh’s own insight into human perspectives and how they are manifested. Inspite of the depressing moments of the film (it has a few), it emerges almost as a guide book. The kind that is trying to tell you, “Have you ever really lost anything by being an optimist?”

372,470,470,470,470,Happy Journey,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/happy-journey-review/,,5/5.0,,3.9,A refreshing idea that outweighs flaws.,"Every once in a while; you come across a film that promises to be something, yet turns out to be entirely different. Happy Journey falls in such a category, but thankfully in a pleasant way. Its trailer tries to be very straightforward. The film, rather, deals with a journey of self-discovery, filled with complexities. It not only surpasses the expectations set by its trailer, but also manages to surprise you every now and then. It won’t be an overstatement if I call this as an achievement; considering the fact that this film is not free of conventionalism.After forgettable Aiyyaa, Sachin Kundalkar brings you a heart-warming tale of two siblings. Niranjan (played impeccably by Atul Kulkarni), when he was just a kid, was sent to Dubai to financially support his family. As a result, he hardly met his sister Janaki over the years. They meet again in unusual circumstances and set off on an extraordinary journey of life.Just like many other films of its genre, Happy Journey chooses the path of a physical journey. But what makes this film so unique is that it’s more of an emotional journey-. The writer-director makes you laugh even in an utterly serious situation and leaves you speechless when you least expect it. He strikes a perfect balance of situational humour and emotional bond with ease. This actually tells you the level of efforts that went behind the film’s writing.Self-discovery films usually land up making melodramatic or philosophical statements. This story strongly avoids it, and rightfully so. Kundalkar understands his protagonists’ world very well. He doesn’t let the focus slip away. Although Pallavi Subhash’s Goan accent initially gets a little hard to adjust to, she does it brilliantly. Secondary characters and a few flimsy moments, however, expose the director's vulnerability. It is undeniably regrettable.Another prominent aspect of this refreshingly beautiful story is the coming-of-age relationship between a brother and his sister. I don’t remember a sister being so convincingly bold, especially in a Marathi film. Priya Bapat delightfully lives up to her role. Shalmali Kholgade’s soulful lullaby – Aakash Jhale, adds a heart-rending layer to her character.Happy Journey looks gorgeous, yet its cinematic beauty remains evident only in parts. Nevertheless, the film is such a joyful experience that you can’t afford not to go on its journey.

A tiny surprise that gives you more of the same, but with some structure - even if it tries do a lot in one go and all of it is predictable. ","Happy New Year is a ""buy one get two free"" film. You were promised a heist, you get that and a revenge drama and underdog film for free. And imagine a Hindi film with three story films and none of them pressing too hard on the romantic angle. And here I was worried that Happy New Year wouldn't have a story a la Tees Maar Khan.  But hey, I'd take that 3 predictable stories compared to none any day. It isn't surprising then that the film is 10 seconds short of three hours. Indeed, I was dreading the movie even before it started just by a look at its runtime. One would have thought movies of this length aren't made any more. And yet, the movie didn't feel that long. Though I don't know who takes the credit for that. Was the movie really engaging or has my patience and general mental readiness for movies belonging to brand Khan improved by a mile and more? For better or worse, as the case may be, the movie slackens only rarely. That didn't make the story any less predictable. Granted, the writers try hard to keep the suspense on, but given the genre of the film and the festive season you know where the film is headed even before you've seen the film. Sure, for every self-referencing, lame joke there is a tiny twist that you wouldn't expect from a Farah Khan film. For every random reference to one film or another there is a tongue-in-cheek remark about pop culture and current trends winking at you. For every time the sole lady in the film is put down by the other characters there is a little detail that catches your attention. Unfortunately, in each of the above cases, the annoying outweighs the surprising, leaving you in a state where you are good with the surprise but can't overcome the banality of the rest of the film. Happy New Year takes a shot at the ""realness"" of reality shows. It laughs at films of its own kind, as Farah Khan films usually do, but this time it wasn't wearing a ""we are like that only"" on its sleeve but had a more ""something needs to be fixed"" attitude. Hats off to Anurag Kashyap and Vishal Dadlani for their sporting spirit, as cheap and meh as their cameo came across as. Who would've thought there'd be a film in which Anurag Kashyap overacts more than Shah Rukh Khan even if it is very intentionally so. In fact, all the actors, as expected again, overact. But, it's not the cringe inducing overact. It's the kind that tries to shove the fact that its all a performance down your throat. The kind which tries to make every moment dramatic and impactful. Yet, each of the characters gets that one scene where you see a glimpse of what the actor is really capable of. Making it seem that it is powerful acting must be the easiest kind to do. Especially for the likes of Boman Irani and Abhishek Bachchan. Shah Rukh Khan comes across as even more narcissistic than usual (especially with the end credits). Sonu Sood is treated like a newbie who has gotten a chance to show off his six-pack, except that they cannot overdo Shah Rukh Khan's ten. The manner in which Deepika Padukone's character Mohini is put down and treated is the shabbiest of them all. That she doesn't leave insult after insult, to me came across as one of the things that the movie was trying to be satirical about. I am not sure, if I am giving the film a little more credit than is due though.  Even so, Deepika Padukone was the only one who really shone in the film. Trying to maintain dignity in the worst of circumstances. The same cannot be said about Abhishek Bachchan. I have now begun to feel bad for him as an actor - he has really reduced to levels where he is a side-flunkey and does whatever comes his way, though he is capable of a lot more. Yet, his comic timing, even with the worst of jokes get you cracking. In that sense, you cannot help but giggle at a lot of what's going on in the film. At times, it feels like you are watching Tom and Jerry. At other times there are innuendos, you'd rather not have in the film - because they are in bad taste, repetitive, not new and not funny. Even so, I am pleasantly surprised and happy that Happy New Year attempted story. Yes, most of it is expectedly lame and laughable. But, isn't it cool that Farah Khan thinks her audience to be worthy of it. As if nodding to the fact that the audiences tastes are changing, even if the nod is a weary one and the change is ever so slow.  Thank you, lady, and I mean it sincerely. This trend, makes me hope that there will be one Diwali, not to far away, that will make me look forward to a Shah Rukh Khan starrer, directed by Farah Khan. Come on Team Khans, you can do it!

Winner of the Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival, this one’s a must watch to appreciate the depth in queer relationships, especially after all the damage Dostana and 
Kantaben have done to our minds. PS: You’d want to book your flight to the Iguazu waterfalls in Argentina once you’ve seen this film.","Just the manner in which Po Wing bends down towards Yui Fai to light a cigarette, just by the way one burning cigarette touches the tip of another, Wong Kar Wai (WKW) uses the most subtle touches between two ignited inanimate objects to describe flames of passion. Happy Together, known to many as a gay love story, has many such moments between Po Wing (Leslie Cheung) and Yui Fai (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) where emotions seem restrained, but WKW’s touch of class gives each gesture immense depth. The story for most part, is that about loneliness and regret, than about the two protagonists being gay. There isn’t really a supporting cast - and there’s no attempt to reflect on the stigma of being homosexuals. The viewer is exposed merely into the world of its two protagonists - Po Wing and Yui Fai. We’re not yet privy to their family stories or the battles they wage every day. If there is any sense of alienation, it is of being in a foreign country and longing for home. The director, however does introduce a new character in the second half of the film - Chang (Chen Chang), who works with Yui Fai at a restaurant. Chang and Yui Fai become close friends and although there are no gay undertones between them, WKW manages to establish his mastery at showing even platonic relationships between men, in the same film. Happy Togetheris an important film. Not just for its portrayal of two queer men, but also for its subtle treatment of romance. Scenes where a a very sick Yui Fai cooks for Po Wing, cleans his wounds, and refuses to let Po sleep with him are fine examples of a director who’s mastered this art. I could sense tears rolling down my eyes when a lonely Yui Fai starts sobbing, when asked to record all his sorrows into a voice-recorder. The beauty of the Iguazu waterfalls, where the duo want to visit, is the most lasting image of the film. There could have been no better visual treat to capture the pathos in the relationship between Po Wing and Yui Fai. Throughout the film, WKW is experimental with his photography - there are the saturated hues, very typical of all his films, as are the monochromatic tones supported with close-ups, which magnify the state of mind of both characters. There’s also the trademark WKW shot in the car with one’s head resting on the other’s shoulder and a walk through the streets late in the night - both of which he replicated in his subsequent film, In The Mood For Love. The colour palette - WKW’s obsession with red - comes across in a major way as his camera flirts with a blood-stained floor at the abbatoir. Being able to spot these consistent patterns are some of the delights of reviewing a Wong Kar Wai film. The director is maintains his signature touches, themes of unfulfilled love and delicate expressionism. He doesn’t shoot colourful people, or colourful sets, but his camera feeds colours into some very grey characters.Buy the DVD. It’s one film you’ll want to revisit again and again. Perhaps when you’re lonely.

Might as well just copy it frame by frame and be done with it. You have no clue how difficult it is to watch this one objectively, without comparison. Let's just say, it's a lousy-lousy copy - when not Home Alone, they take a scene from Kungfu Hustle and I'm sure it has bits of Carry On if one of the directors claims so. Actually, there is a bit of originality and contextual alteration. We have one of the burglars using abusive language appropriately beeped off. Now, why one would do that in a kids' movie is beyond me. To top it off, they have a 10-year old being smothered by a skimpily clad Shamita Shetty and a sundry bunch of women. Hmph...Many a time in remakes, if the story fails, other departments compensate. But here, most performances try to complement the loud character and slapsticky tone. Except Zain and Swini seem enthusiastic and look like they were having fun troubling the adults around. But everything else - the costumes of the two burglars, the sets and locations, the background music - are not appealing at all. If nothing else, just plain and simple continuity to make sense out of the mayhem? Na-ah!I think I'm just going to get the entire Home Alone series on DVD/VCD for the kids. Much rather have them watch those. On the other hand, it will be interesting to see how they react to Hari Puttar and see whether they think one of their favorites have been ruined. It's only 90 minutes after all. Oops! That'd mean I'll have to watch it again. No thanks, I think I'll pass.

Only to bring us the magic of cinema. His dedication and unwavering attitude will be an inspiration to date because of this well-made film.,"Only an enthusiastic, never-say-die, determined, and crazy person could have brought films to India in that day and age. Importing and understanding mechanical equipment was considerably easy when you compared it to the taboo associated with doing anything out of the normal. An art form absolutely unknown to the masses, let alone go around stigma-free. And women working in a venture like this would be a social suicide. These are the odds we are transported to. Mokashi does a wonderful job of making this a light peek into the hard work without letting us get too sentimental or too stark a depiction of his hardship. He doesn't introduce us to the darker side of Phalke's life at all. His insecurities, the craze for his work completely taking over his life to the extent that his and his family's health is at stake. Not to mention the bleak financial situation that they were already in. While we can complain about the ever-smiling Phalke, the harshness is treated in the same tone as the rest of the film. Every once in a while the film switches to the 8mm and silent era feel albeit in color. And it adds humor and is in perfect context. Also you can't help but smile at the compare and contrast of how things have changed to today. For example, shunning anyone who wants to work towards his passion and go against the tide; the younger generation being more receptive to a new thing; the diminishing value of other forms of entertainment after the advent of the moving images; attempt of actors to steal more screen space from co-stars; we accord her on screen today; the need to imitate the technologies used in the west; the contrast between the mute but strong role a woman played in that time with the respect(?); the contrast between people applauding something as simple as the growth of a plant and the need for constant entertainment(?) now. The film is after all an obituary of sorts. To the 2 years that the Father of Indian cinema spent in making THE first Indian film Raja Harishchandra. And like an obituary it is polite and sweet. It is also an enchanting time travel to a century ago. Go for it and take the kids along!

377,475,475,475,475,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2,Owner's Pride!,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/harry-potter-and-deathly-hallows-part-2-review/,,5/5.0,,4.6,"Once you move beyond comparing the books to the movies, and label both as separate entities – not only could you enjoy both but you could happily postpone the “real” end to when the movies come out. It’s here, both parts of Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows are out and it’s finally over – the movies, the books, the lives, the memories. What is not over though, is your love, anticipation of and growth with the series. Because each time you watch/read them – you’ll love, anticipate and grow even more so. ","This weekend I attended a funeral. I cried, mourned the death and let myself sink into a grey hovering void. This weekend I saw the second part of Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows. I pep talked myself into letting go; all that jazz about how life moves on and death is an eventual calamity much like the jack in the box – it’s over before you know it. But it doesn’t. Because this end is metaphorical. Almost the same line is used in every review of a Harry Potter movie – the book was better, and the film missed out on many crucial parts. But for those of you who have been following only the films, this movie is an all-encompassing, wrapped liked a sushi roll, crisp ending to a saga.Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows takes us through the last bits of Harry’s journey as he finds parts of Voldemort’s soul, also known as horcruxes and destroys them. The film picks out the best moments and twists it into a visual glamour. With threads of emotion, it thrills and walks us through many lives, many endings.It has the emotional tension: between what Dumbledore has left behind and Harry’s doubts, between Snape’s veiled demeanor and Harry’s rage, between Harry’s bravery and Voldermort’s sinister fury. It is Harry’s journey but the story of so many more people: Of the Weasley family, 3 friends from different backgrounds and their intertwining lives, the many professors that put a mark on every Hogwarts students’ life and Snape – who’s beyond levels of comprehension.The opening and closing shots of the film are grand, as if they are hints of what became and what is being left behind. Eduardo Serra’s photography is distinct and symbolic with the feel that one gets while reading the book. It incorporates a tired, yet reassuring tone that allows you to live each moment of intense and passionate action. Alan Rickman as Snape and the trio – Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are majorly the reason for the lump in your throat. They manage to carry with them reminiscent performances of every film and mould them into an adventure ride that feel privileged to take with them. Each character, each loose end is tied into a knot; every sub-plot given its due ending – closure in all senses. This film, unlike the others which bore the pressure of matching up to the books, manages to leave a visual impact, and comes pretty close to the images you formed in your head. If only the climax were played out with a more growing pace. Although by the end of the film, you’re almost on the edge because you know the end is nearing, you still want to put your time on the moment. The emotional connect is haunting and Alexander Despat’s background score is like melodies flowing into sentences of drama, yet the end seems like a series of quick montages.Or maybe that’s coming from an emotional viewer’s perspective. I would never get up from my seat. I would sit there, living the entire world of witchcraft and wizardry in my head on loop – but I was forced to walk away. Watch the film so you can identify the message that the movie is trying to send to you –Beyond the magic, charm, tragedies and memories. When you walk out from this theatre, remember to feel special because you have been a part of the Harry Potter generation.

Harry, Ron and Hermione embark on their quest to find the rest of the horcruxes and destroy them, while You-Know-Who (Seriously. You must know who) hunts for the one of the three Deathly Hallows that'll make him even more awesome-freakinly-powerful than he already is. Obviously their path isn't easy and is full of people trying to capture, torture and kill them. Great fun. So is the movie good? Yes. Does it follow the book? More than any other movie of this series did. Is there loads of action in this one? No, but it has lots of promises for the last one. So should we then go to the theaters or not? Well, in most cases (if you have a kid, wife or GF/BF/BFF who is a die-hard Harry Potter fan) you don't really have a choice, do you? But even if you do, it's worth a watch.","First things first. Yes, I've read all the books of Harry Potter. Fourth book onwards, all of them the first day. Does it make me a Harry Potter fan. Yes (Well, I prefer to call myself a J.K. Rowling fan). But does that make me a fan of the movies based on the uber-popular books too? Sadly, no. I didn't like most of the movie interpretations of the books. But after watching the pathetic interpretations of the Percy Jackson and The Golden Compass, I think these folks are doing a fine job with Harry Potter. Still, I went to watch this one with lowered expectations. And I was wonderfully surprised. As soon as the censor certificate showed up with the movie title on it, everyone in the theater was hooting, clapping and the kids were making all sorts of happy noises. So that set the mood. And the movie carried it forward from then on. About the movie: Harry, Ron and Hermione set out to find and destroy the rest of the horcruxes to defeat Lord Voldemort. On their journey they discover the existence of the three deathly hallows, which are the three most powerful magical objects of the wizarding world. They also uncover, that You-Know-Who is hunting one of them to become invincible. The movie doesn't show much action, but lays ground for much. Each character prepares for the inevitable war, that is to come in the last movie, which fingers-crossed, would be most awesome. The lead actors (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and ever-so-lovely Emma Watson) have done their job well.The supporting cast didn't have much role in this one but everyone shined brilliantly in the screen-time they had. I personally am a huge-huge fan of Helena Bonham Carter (who plays Bellatrix Lestrange in the movie) and would have loved to see more of her. But hey, the story is already written and they can't play around with it much. However, they did try to fit in a few lighter moments in the film that were not in the book, and have pulled off most of them. A couple of times, the jokes seem forced though.Most of the movie is shot in shades of gray (So if you're not watching it on the big-screen you're not going to enjoy it much). While I heard a few people complain about the darkness of the movie (They meant the dark colors. Though Voldemo... whoops.... He-who-must-not-be-named oozes plenty of darkness too), I loved it. Like in the movies like The Dark Night, Inception, Kill Bill, etc the darker shades added to the eeriness of the movie and took it from a kids' film to a we-mean-serious-business one. The background score by Alaxandre Desplat is amazing. Cinematography is a visual treat. Screenplay and Direction are ten folds better than the two movies that preceded this one. And here is another surprise. The best thing about the movie for me was not Emma Watson (Not even her making out scene. Yes, there is one. You're already on your way to the theater aren't you?) Not that. It was the five minutes animated sequence that told the story of the origin of the three deathly hallows. Brilliant is an understatement for it. It's so brilliantly done that I didn't want it to end. Verdict: You know you're going to watch it. And you wouldn't enjoy watching it nearly as much on your TV screen. So you should go, watch, and enjoy this one on the big screen. But if you were hoping for lots of action, you'd be disappointed.

But the sheer power of the manner in which Kashmir has been captured on celluloid will make it worth a watch for many.","Harud (Autumn), directed by the talented Aamir Bashir, isn’t the easiest of films to watch. Set in an autumn in Kashmir around the time cellular services are set to be launched in the strife-torn state, it tells the story of a family that has lost one son and is grappling with a tormented other. Poignant and confusing in equal measures, it is a film that can be discussed far more than the run time of the film; a film that is sure to have polarized opinions, ranging from it being called sensitive and beautiful, to it being found slow and downright pretentious. Harud is that rare film, however, which I’d recommend, even if I’m not sure whether the person I’m recommending it to will like it or not. Rafiq, the surviving son of the family, is the focal point of the film. Essentially directionless, his life seems to slowly take meaning when he picks up something that belonged to his brother. Without giving anything away, the best thing for me about Harud is the journey that Rafiq takes between finding his brother’s belonging and actually using it for the first time. Co-written, co-produced and shot by Shanker Raman, arguably one of India’s best cinematographers today, the film’s real victory lies in the manner in which it captures life in Kashmir. No wide, sweeping shots to capture the beauty of the Valley here; Harud is more intimate than that. It is the close-ups, the long, hand-held takes of faces, actions and life that truly bring out the essence of what it must be like to live in such a beautiful place, yet have terror hanging over your head like the Sword of Damocles.The film, however, suffers from some key flaws, which bring the film down considerably. Primary amongst them are the performances. Even though every character looks their part completely, the acting is quite wooden and stilted at places. The dialogues often sound like they are being read out, rather than being felt by the characters and delivered.Also, there seems to be no real clarity on exactly what the makers of the film were trying to convey. Yes, the angst of families living in Kashmir, the fact that youth there are looking to escape that life, the little nuances in the life of a Kashmiri, all of these, and more, are there in the film in abundance. And the fact that clearly, the intention is to draw our attention to it is visible in the treatment. But, visual appeal apart, there seems to be no particular reason for a lot of the happenings in the film. For example, I enjoyed every one of the long, beautiful tracking shots of Rafiq on a bicycle, but I can’t claim to understand exactly why there were so many of them in the film.While uninspiring writing and poor acting can potentially cripple a film, with Harud, they come across more as aberrations than anything else. The long takes are compensated for by the edgy camera-work, bringing about a sense of urgency despite the slow pace. The cinematography is one of the reasons I never found the film slow at all. Minimalist in every sense, the film has virtually no background music, relying on the sounds of Kashmir to create emotions that would otherwise have been created by music.Harud is the kind of film that you need to submit yourself to, to immerse yourself in, in order to enjoy the visual and emotional experience that it is. Personally, I’ve seen a number of films set in Kashmir before, but this is truly the first film that has made me want to actually live there.

A girl-meets-boy story which works despite typical moments that qualify a film as a romantic comedy. ,"And some times, love doesn't happen at first sight, unlike most films would have us believe. Or love doesn't necessarily follow intense animosity. Some times, you get to know a person and then you acknowledge the attraction you felt towards them. And some times, the film tries this stunt and it works even though it falls into the typical trappings of romantic comedies every once in a while. Given that this genre is done to death, it is the characters and the moments chosen to drive the story forward that have to do all the hard work. The characters have to make themselves interesting with their gray shades and humanness and at the same time make us root for them. The situations have to present themselves in a novel way without seeming totally out of the box. Hasee Toh Phasee succeeds on both counts, to a large extent. Meeta (Parineeti Chopra) is a zany character that is immediately likable. She is overtly quirky and yet given Parineeti's skills she makes you overlook her craziness as ""possible"". It's not that Parineeti Chopra outdoes herself or has given a marvelous performance. Neither has she under-played the part. She just does her thing and convinces us to be with Meeta, for Meeta.Nikhil (Siddharth Malhotra) too is interesting because he is so plain. You don't see such characters in films who are your regular John Doe and yet can keep you interested in how his life goes about. In fact, it is his simple-mindedness that charms you. That and the glimpse of craziness that is stifled by the ""system"".Parineeti and Siddharth play it well together too. From the indifference to the neutral to the confused to the smitten - they convince you through the steps of falling in love. It is the side characters that leave you unconvinced. All but Manoj Joshi overact and make the act borderline slapsticky. And therein lie the traps that Hasee Toh Phasee falls prey to. There are a few cliché situations that it finds itself in. But, the point to note here is that the film is set in the middle of a wedding and it is a Karan Johar production and yet things stay more-or-less non-masala. That is the director and writer's victory. It is refreshing to watch something different being attempted in as rundown a genre as rom-com. It is refreshing to see the lead female protagonist get something real to do - maybe the technicalities are all over the place but at least she isn't one of the two extremes tomboy/chirpy-bubbly or demure/shyness incarnate. It is a little disappointing to see her too, make her life about her man. But, then again, maybe that is what love does to you.

But, the film that it has turned into is certainly well worth hating. From acting to music to pretty much everything else, Hate Story pushes your patience to the brink. ","Isn't it a shame that a woman has been so wronged by such an obnoxious man and I feel bad for her only conceptually? Only my imagination of what it must have been like evokes any kind of emotion out of me? And this is in the first half hour of the film. My exasperation only gets worse as the Hate Story progresses.In the entire film, there are only two things that are just about okay. One is Gulshan Devaiya's stammer and the other is the attempt at making the story a business-mind game. But these are barely things that I can call that 'work' or 'are going for the film'. They just happen to be there for me to be able to say at least a few things nice about the film. Okay fine, Nikhil Dwivedi broods just about right. Talking about Paoli Dam's performance would involve recalling her whispering and sighing in attempt to seduce, which I'm trying my best to resist. And...""ha ha ha ha ha ha"" this is a ROFL at those who went in expecting sizzling, explicit sex based on the promos. Little do they know they've seen all there is to see in the trailer itself. In fact,  the uncensored version of the trailer has even a little more than the film. And another, ""ha ha ha ha ha ha"" at me - for wondering, even for the slightest moment, if Hate Story would finally be the Hindi film that shows two people can be comfortable with their bodies and themselves while having sex. Now, the whole idea behind having the lead lady turn into a top-notch call-girl is obviously to be able to market the film. Then, I am giving it too much benefit of doubt by thinking, ""Sure they didn't tell me exactly why she HAD to turn into a prostitute, but maybe it was the easiest way for her to get what she wanted."" One thing Hate Story does a god job of, is to expose the fragility of the male ego. One male after another falls for this woman whose focus is only her revenge and not one relents even after they know the truth about her. But then again, you don't need to see a movie for that, do you? runs for shelter Oh, the other selling point in the trailer seemed to be the free use of cuss words. Character after character uses the f-word more awkwardly than 12-year olds who use that language. Unfortunately, everything in Hate Story sounds and looks contrived with the sole motivation of getting the audience to the theater - by hook or crook. And it doesn't quite work.

The actors do the best they can with the lame dialogues given to them.  The music is loud and pretty much unpleasant (except the promo song).,"There couldn’t have been a more generic story line.  Replace cricket with any other obsession for the two cricket-crazy characters and the movie would be the same – awful. I assume the movie is named hattrick because there are “three” story lines and they have some connection to cricket. There are three threads in the movie - Kunal Kapoor-Rimi Sen; Nana Patekar-Danny Denzongpa; Paresh Rawal with his family. So far so good. Kunal is a huge cricket fan – lame but OK. Danny Denzongpa is bowler turned coach. OK. Paresh Rawal – this is what I think happened here – the writer wrote Paresh Rawal’s story; dozed off while struggling to inject some cricket connection in the blank spaces (I wonder why); woke up to find that he had crossed the deadline for submitting it; and submitted what he had. Because the writer was late, the others did not have time to read it and started making the movie as is.I think the most connection this movie had to cricket was the number of advertisements squeezed in – Reebok, Café Coffee Day, Starbucks, Tootsies, Kellogg’s,  Fedex (and I am sure I missed some). If that is not enough to annoy you, there are the usual extra-bright blues, pinks and oranges you associate with a movie that has no qualms about taking cinematic liberties.Connection between the three threads? Goodness, you guys have no limits to your expectations! They give you three stories (?) instead of one and now you want them to connect?!?Nana Patekar, Paresh Rawal, Danny Denzongpa did what the script asked them to do and therefore no complaints from them, except for taking up the roles in the first place. Then there is Kunal Kapoor for those interested in drooling over muscular physique and Rimi Sen (with an overdose of make-up) for those interested in looking at sexy seducing women. They serve their purpose well by having a tough competition for the who’s-going-to-show-more-skin competition? Their performances were mostly loud. Speaking of loud, for the first time ever, I wanted a remote to fast forward the songs. Okay-okay, enough with the negativity. The good thing is, I laughed out loud thrice in the movie and smiled once, so that is 3.5 laughs in less than two hours. Hey, wow! A hattrick and a little more. The other dialogues were…oops, can’t remember…well, let’s just say very forgettable then - especially the preachy ones in the end. Since I can’t seem to control my cynical attitude and have already used more gray matter to write this review than the makers used to make the movie, I shall take your leave until next time.

If it were not for decent performances by the lead actors, it could have easily been one of those horror comedies.","Every horror film review by me has to have the ""I HATE horror films"" disclaimer. I can't handle the creepy, crawling feeling a well-made horror film creates and sustains for the length of the film. And if the film is not well-made, well... Haunted had a few scares that work because of the timing but for the rest of the time you are either laughing at it or questioning the logic that it puts itself in. How can you be blamed for wondering why a spirit is struggling with doors and walls when at other times, it freely moves from room to room and even city to city without trouble. Yep, it's that kind of a film. The super-slow start builds zero suspense, because you can predict when a door is going to creak or a book is going to fall or a light is going to flicker. And this goes on and on and on, that too at a slow pace. It's surprising then, towards the climax, even though I knew how  the film is going to most likely end and my patience had worn out four times over, I felt for the protagonists and I wanted the spirit to die. And that I think is mostly due to the performances. While Mahakshay had pretty much only one expression to hold, he did it fine. Tia Bajpai made you feel for her especially in the rape scenes. Enough to control the damage caused by her voice and non-horrified scenes. The make-up of the spirits and the background music that goes with them are enough to scare you the few times they do.All this would have been acceptable if the story had anything new to offer. No, ""spirit"" experts illuminating us with ridiculous ways in which evil works, does not count. Same old troubled spirit haunting a house reaches out to an unsuspecting visitor decades, after the human body it lived in dies. Same old ways in which the spirit can be conquered. It's just too little to form entertainment (even the creepy/crawly kind). It matters little that the 3D technology used is completely wasted.

Spirited and heart-warming performances make Hawaa Hawaai stand out.,"You have an innocent looking child. He is poor. He has to work hard. And then you see a gleam in his eye for something unreachable. What's there not to like about stories like these? Especially when there are reasonably decent performances. Hawaa Hawaai is yet another story that inspires to reach out for your passion. At the same time, It attempts at sensitizing you to the issues of child labour in Mumbai slums - which is nice, even if a little too in-the-face. It is yet another story that you can watch. The only problem is the words ""yet another"".Hawaa Hawaai's story has a very ""been there, seen that"" feeling about it. The melodrama doesn't help its case. And then it has a preachy undertone, which borderline beats its own purpose. The good thing is, every time it goes into one of these zones, it manages to get back on track pretty quickly. In fact, it even makes some points rather subtly, in contrast to its own style thus far. The writing is very simple. The story doesn't dig deep into its characters, nor does it even try to create too many ups and downs. In fact, the first down that our protagonist Arjun aka Raju (Partho Gupte) sees came way after I thought, ""isn't this all happening too easily for him?"" The beauty is that you don't mind things working out easily for Arjun. His character and situation has been built up such that it'd be wrong of you not to sympathize with his condition instantaneously. Yes, the film is  pretty judgmental about its audience. It wants to educate. It wants to sensitize. All very noble, except that it gets patronizing every once in a while. Fortunately, the combined effort of the actors, doesn't allow the patronizing to become overwhelming. Partho Gupte's earnest performance; Saqib Salim's enthusiastic one; and the knowing irony that the four kids in Arjun's gang bring out together don't allow you to get bogged down with the overt effort to sensitize.I also found myself intermittently tuning off the lyrics to the songs playing in the background. One, there were way too many of them. Two, the music wasn't too great. Three, the lyrics are predictable. In any case, will I take my kids to watch this one? Yes, for sure. And hopefully, that will contribute to efforts in inspiring some form of social responsibility in them. That - Hawaa Hawaai might be perfect for.

Unfortunately, dull and long. ","It is great to learn something that you didn't know about through a film. It is great to learn that there was a scientist who tried to get a plane to fly before the people we know it – the Wright Brothers. It is also awesome to know that the secret was written down in ancient scriptures. Whether or not it was true or has sound grounds is a matter of debate that is beyond the scope of this review. In either case, it matters not which nationality the scientist belonged to nor does it matter which religion the scriptures originated from. (Can text books belong to a religion anyway?) Was India even one nation when the text was written? But, the point of Hawaizaada seems to be to say, “we first, we first!” Not to mention that the film says that over more than 2.5 hours.Hawaizaada might just have passed of as a sweet story had it been shorter. A one-line plot summary would be “A man wanted to build an airplane.” And while it alludes to the freedom struggle, family dynamics, romance etc, the film despite having one point to focus on is all over the place. The romantic moments as do the patriotic ones make you go, “Huh? Where did that come from?” The emotions on display are too strong compared to the mild build-up. The background music and the sets are way too theatric to make you take anything in the film seriously. The film is too bright and sharp for us to believe it is the 19th century. Sure, films themselves are to blame to make us believe that those were rustic times. But, it is distracting for sure and makes you feel you are watching a play rather than a film. The language too seems a little too contemporary. At other times times the director attempts childish comedy under the garb of Chaplin-esque. Ayushman Khurana has his charm but it is getting old now. Also, it is a rare male actor who can cry well on screen, and he is not one of them. Mithun Chakraborty carries the eccentricity well, when it is asked of him. But it is uneven – the asking, not the doing. Pallavi Sharda's existence in the film makes it a not-so brave film. If the idea was to make a film because the concept of an Indian having made the first plane to fly was so appealing why did it need the lady prop? That shows lack of conviction. With an audience that is eager to lap up any film that has novel concepts, it was worth trying this one without making it a musical. Another hint that the film tries to appeal to a populist sentiment is having Ayushman Khurana speak in Marathi. Authenticity would be a wrong argument to make because no one other than his character Shivi speaks in Marathi, including his parents. It's not like he continuously speaks in Marathi either. So, not only was the first man to fly a plane an Indian, he spoke Marathi too! It would be really sad if this move was to break the actor's North Indian boy image. Yet, I will look forward to his next film,  because he chooses films that are not the norm. And that is the only thing that works for Hawaizaada - something different was attempted. Despite all its pitfalls, Hawaizaada attempts at telling the story of a carefree, wayward, rich, spoilt brat who is also smart and sharp when it interests him. And he went on to fly a plane. Patriotism and national pride aside.

386,484,484,484,484,Head-On,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/head-on-review/,,,,2.15,"Head On is what one would call a ‘hardcore’ love story. Passions run high amongst the lead characters Cahit and Sibel, who, after a marriage of convenience, discover that their violent ways could destroy them both. The self-destructive, intense and gory nature of their romance may not be ideal family viewing, but movie buffs must certainly watch what is now hailed as one of Fatih Akin's finest films. Winner of the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival.","I gifted the DVD of Head On to my brother on his wedding anniversary, only to discover that he returned it to me a week later, stating that his wife didn’t regard it as a ‘wedding anniversary’ gift. This surprised me. I’d enjoyed watching Head On. However, now that bro had returned it, I watched it again, wearing the ‘wedding anniversary’ lens. And I realised that bhabhi is right.It didn’t mean that Head On is not a good film – it’s just that despite being a story about a married couple’s relationship, it is a setting that many would find too intense and uncomfortable. In fact, without the destruction and violence they bring upon themselves, the passions that run between Cahit and Sibel and their love for each other, commands envy. Set in Turkey, Head On is about Cahit, a 40-yr old hot-tempered divorcee, who attempts suicide only to land up at rehab where he meets Sibel, who proposes him to marry her immediately. Not that she wants to be married, but her parents want a Turkish groom. This promise to be just ‘room-mates’ after marriage, is what marks the beginning of a life, that spins wildly out of their control, where their independent identities overlap their sense of being married. Akin’s treatment of the film is like that of a ballad. An orchestra, beautifully perched on the banks of the Bosphorus river in Istanbul starts the film and makes appearances at key moments, deepening our understanding of the story. This helps us see Cahit and Sibel as characters in a tale, rather than those with whom we look to identify with. At times, you feel sorry for the couple, thinking that if only they tried, they could make things so much better. At times, you cheer for them, as they discover sparks in what is simply a marriage of convenience. Cahit is an addict, with a bad temper and is sometimes in bed with other women. Sibel, on the  other hand is a dream room-mate to have, cooks really well, cleans the room, insists on hitting the dance floor often, but doesn’t mind hooking up for the night with the first good looking man she finds. These traits not only draw Cahit and Sibel closer to each other, but also disrupt their lives permanently. The film’s music is one of its biggest strengths. Akin uses it well (reminds you of Dev D). Both Cahit and Dev drink like a fish, do drugs, show anger through violence and keep their rooms extremely dirty. The similarities end there. Akin, in an interview on the DVD, says that he was immensely inspired by people like Kurt Cobain and James Dean. Indeed, both of their self-destructive characters, are depicted in how he directs Cahit and Sibel. Both Birol Unnel (Cahit) and Sibel Kekilli (Sibel) give oustanding performances.Head On is disturbing and gory, because it makes no inhibition in showing violent love. But it is one film that you want to revisit, just to relive passions that you rarely see in relationships these days. Some may mistake Akin’s story as that of love at first sight, when in fact, it is about impulsive choices and consequences that go beyond your control.

387,485,485,485,485,Heartbreaker,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/heartbreaker-review/,,5/5.0,,4.15,"Just the title Heartbreaker, makes the film predictable. While sometimes that can be annoying, in this film’s case it partly works. Romain Duris, with all his SRK-type charm, is the main reason why. If only the film found a way to incorporate its wittiness through the film. And it’s a pity there were no breath-taking visuals, for a film based largely in Monaco. A backdrop of the French Riveria, would have taken the film to another level. ","Heartbreaker’s premise sounded like it was another offshoot of Ladies vs Ricky Bahl. In French. I instantly knew I had to go see this film, especially since in India only more serious French movies get released (if at all). It was almost a field day for the romantic in me, to be able to see a French rom-com. And even though it’s a predictable, structured film – Romain Duris (of Russian Dolls and The Beat That My Heart Skipped fame) pulls the film through. Alex (Duris), along with his sister and her husband (Julie Ferrier and François Damiens) have a unique business - they breakup marriages/relationships. The opening scene of the film steals you; set in Morocco it’s a crisp entertaining 15 minutes describing Alex’s craft with women. He’s the typical rom-com anti-hero-who-becomes-the-hero, one who claims to never fall in love, especially with his clients. And you find yourself wanting to believe him, which is pretty admirable for a film of this genre. Alex’s method is simple. He convinces rather vulnerable targets that their partners are just not right for them, by charming the woman’s pants off, except that he keeps it professional. This makes for a witty and fascinating quarter of the film. It goes downhill the minute he meets, what the trailers refer to as “his match” i.e. the girl capable of making him fall in love. Currently in Monaco, he gets an assignment to break up the upcoming marriage of wine connoisseur Juliette (Vanessa Paradis) – this also being the only French ingredient in Heartbreaker, as everything else (structure, formulas, clothing, background music and the subtitled dialogues) is wannabe Hollywood. So much so that even Juliette's best friend Sophie (Helen Noguerra) is a sex fiend who magically makes Juliette look classy. Typical. The only salvage is Paradis’ looks like an elegant, aristocratic sweetheart – an image that  comes through by virtue of her friend's behaviour, but it works with her appearance.    Alex enters Juliette’s life as her bodyguard. And even though he seems reluctant at first to break up a wedding that is due in 10 days, he is forced because of his financial desperation – a lagging, unnecessary subplot involving irrelevant goons and thugs. The rest of the movie becomes like a liability; one that you are forced to watch because you were not given an option in the beginning. You simply had to fall in love with Alex, and curse yourself as he predictably falls in love with Juliette. Heartbreaker is a good-looking movie, but it’s one that tries too hard. The subtitles are timed and you don’t get the feeling that it’s a language that you might not understand. Halfway through Heartbreaker, it’s like the makers forgot to add an ounce of charm. The plot then starts beginning to feel heavy – and the background music a little too mushy. I’m surprised no American studio has bought the rights yet. All praise to Romain Duris, though, who is an absolute charmer and brings the movie to a watchable slate. Maybe on a cold winter afternoon with your girlfriends.

388,486,486,486,486,Hello,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma reviewNotepadPreview2 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/hello-review/,,4/5.0,,3.65,One wonders if books should really be converted to films. It doesn't always work out better.,"Books being converted to movies are always a risky thing to do. Not always does it work out. Even in the case of something as epic as ‘The Godfather’, there is a split on which is better – the book or the movie. I belong to the side that votes for the book. And in the case of ‘Hello’, I feel the makers should not have attempted to bring it to the big screen at all.It is not so much about the fact that the plot is wafer thin or that the makers have chosen to ignore basic characterization in favor of dramatization. In any case, the backdrop of a call centre is incidental to the story and how it unfolds. Therefore the focus on this aspect seems unnecessary. Since this was always an adaptation of the book, the filmmakers could well have rewritten the backdrop to make it more believable on screen.The story is a simple one of six call-centre employees working on the same shift and how their lives seem to be intertwined. And then there’s the night when things go awry. The physical setting of the call center (from the outside) looks genuine enough, but inside, it looks nothing short of a resort. Having seen a few call centres, I find it hard to believe that there are only six people working in a ‘bay’ at a time when headquarters (i.e. the US) is looking to cut costs. The very basic one would have expected from an IIM graduate writer when doing the screenplay is to pay more attention to such detail and make better use of the space. The story begins by appealing to the frontbenchers and Salman Khan doing an item number (rather tackily picturised with plastic water bottles, graphics that don’t belong anywhere and a song that has no meaning). Hereafter he retires to the lounge of his helicopter charter service since he is stuck for over two hours on account of his chopper being repaired. And this is where Katrina Kaif finds him and the story begins.Shyam/Agent Sam (Sharman Joshi), Varun/Vroom (Sohail Khan), Radhika (Amrita Arora), Eesha (Eesha Koppikar), Priyanka (Gul Panag) and Military Uncle/VP Chauhan (Sharat Saxena) are colleagues and have been it would seem for almost four years. That none of them have a good enough accent when answering calls is a matter for their employer to worry about, not us! But this group is stuck at work on a stormy night when most systems are down and their lives are unraveling. Their evil (and conniving, yet stupid) boss Mr Bakshi (Dalip Tahil) is the common object of hate in the group.  All the actors try their very best to look and be the part of call centre employees. One could argue that director Atul Agnihotri did not want to have a typical teenybopper look to the movie since they all do get identified as a bunch in the age-group of 20-25. Why I think Agnihotri didn’t want to typecast is because none of them look like they fit this age group. Especially Gul Panag and Sohail Khan. As the night progresses, so does the childish nature of the entire narrative. While most of the sequences in the book itself were hard to digest, the movie makes it even worse. (There are typical references to gays and how Mr Bakshi is ok with it since this is an American company). Of the cast, Sharman Joshi shines through the cast as the confused team leader who has recently broken up with Priyanka. Eesha Koppikar hams her way through what could have been a better written role while Amrita Arora spends most of the time looking like a dolled up bahu dissatisfied with life. Sharat Saxena is honest to his role, but he doesn’t have much to do and once again, the characterization leaves much to be desired. Gul Panag in her role as Priyanka is bound to catch everyone’s eye. For she has spent a lot of time showing off her newfound cleavage. It is shocking to see how badly suited she is to the role. She tries to dress up like a 25-year-old, but just can’t pull it off. In the bargain, all she manages is to look like a tramp (and she seriously needs help with make-up to align two mismatched eyebrows!).When the author of the book himself is doing the screenplay and dialogues, it is expected that he won’t stray too far from the original work. Unfortunately, when the book itself has been written like a screenplay, it is tough to adapt it further to the big screen. One of the biggest negatives of the movie is the intentional name calling towards ‘goras’. As a one-off, this could have fit into the movie. But repeated insistences like “the mental ability of a 35-year-old American is as much as a 10-year-old Indian” and “Gore to fattu hote hai” aren’t exactly in the best taste. The entire movie is based on a ‘call from God’ that takes up about 5 minutes at best. Whatever they hear on the call is promptly put into action by the group with ridiculous ease. Nonetheless, the movie does have its moments when Sohail Khan and Sharman Joshi are on screen and but for their comic timing, the movie would have been nothing short of torturous.

It looks like it succeeds, even beyond the imagination of the makers. I understand drop in production values because of low budgets, but making fools out of decent actors is inexcusable. ","I guess the point of Hello Darling is to bring the working woman's sentiment against the casting-couch-types out in the open. But isn't there a less crass way of doing it. If not, isn't there any new way to do crass? At least none involved in Hello Darling thought so.Where does one begin the complaints from? sighAfter having closed my eyes and mulled over that one for a bit, I think my biggest grievance is against the way the actors were used. I admit, I was a teeny-weeny bit excited with the news that my teenage crush (this was in the ""Videocon Flashback"" days) Javed  Jaffrey, is doing a male solo lead. I had hopes from the team that realized he could carry off a movie shared my belief that he can do more than slapstick. But, as you've guessed, that isn't meant to be. Not yet.Other than Gul Panag, the women though are not really known for their acting prowess. But looks like she too has been made to pull a page out of their book in shrieking and making faces which are irrelevant or exaggerate or both. I don't think it is their fault either, I think they did exactly what they were told to do.  And they clearly weren't asked to better themselves.Same goes for almost each department of film-making. The dialogue was what goes with the slapstick - cheap innuendoes, scurrying around, slaps and all. The songs were there because they are ""expected"" to be there. Actors who can't do the Bollywood dance bit are made to dance, and Javed Jaffrey is on the bench.I know one is not supposed to expect from films with posters boasting a man in boxer shorts. I know one is not supposed to expect much when the name, Hardik is spelled as Harddick. But the hopeful in me wants to like a film, wants to love it. Oh well, there's always a next time.

390,488,488,488,488,Hello Jai Hind,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review46 Reader Reviews 3/5.0 1 Tweet Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/hello-jai-hind-review/,,3/5.0,5/5.0,4.1,"Hello Jai Hind, Gajendra Ahire’s latest film, is a dramatic, hard-hitting tale of an honest constable and his fight against the feeble politico-judicial system. While far from perfect, the film engages you because of its un-glorified, realistic treatment. In spite of the flaws in its writing and male lead Nitin Desai’s weak performance, the film is highly watchable because of Ahire’s mature handling of the story. Lead actress Trupti Bhoir’s performance, Nitin Desai’s art direction and Illaiyaraaja’s music enhance it further, making it a worthy addition to the films that have begun emerging from the fast-evolving Marathi film industry. ","Sadrakshanay Khalnigrahanay. Roughly translated as ‘Protecting good, destroying evil’. Cynics though we may be, perhaps we could grant that the motto of the Maharashtra Police is simple but elegant. (So what if their official website translates it as “Protecting The Rightous [sic] And Controlling & Annihilating The Evil” (sic)?)  Today, on the eve of the third anniversary of 26/11, comes a tribute to the brave yet controversial men who often lay their lives on the line, for you and me. Noted Marathi filmmaker Gajendra Ahire’s latest offering, Hello Jai Hind, is a take on the travails and angst of an honest policeman. No, not an ‘ACP’ or an ‘Inspector’, but a constable. That man on the lowest rung of the hierarchical ladder of the police force. In cinema, he is generally ignored, often parodied and stereotyped, but never truly done justice to. Not that this film pretends to be a realistic documentary, far from it. Where it succeeds is that it takes a dramatic story and treats it in a manner more honest than most of what we cinephiles have been subjected to lately. Yes, there are flaws. Yes, the film is prone to over-the-top theatrics in moments where subtlety would perhaps have worked better. Yes, the screenplay could and should have been tighter, with a more impactful climax. But in times where the audience’s idea of a good cop film is Singham, Hello Jai Hind is a refreshing film.Celebrated art director Nitin Chandrakant Desai makes his acting debut as Shivaji Pawar, an honest man who chose to be a policeman, because that is all he ever wanted to be. While it is quite clear that Desai is not an actor and that he clearly lacks the ability to pull off such a complex role, one can also quite clearly see why he was chosen to play the protagonist - he looks the part. He looks like he could be a constable in the Mumbai police. The gait, the posture, the hair, the physique, everything about him says ‘Constable Pawar’.  Performance-wise it is actress (and producer) Trupti Bhoir, as Shivaji Pawar’s wife, who steals the show. She is competent, she also looks the part, and she has a presence that always makes you interested in what her character’s next move will be. The story is as much hers as it is his. It is tough being a Mumbai policeman’s wife, especially a constable’s, because the dangers are high and the returns are low. Trupti manages to make us feel that turmoil.They say, ‘God is in the details’. That is Gajendra Ahire’s big victory in this film. The wife tells her husband, in passing, that instead of a new sari, she would rather save up for a fridge. A few scenes later, when months have passed in their lives, in a long two-shot, unobtrusively parked along a wall stands a small fridge. No attention is drawn to it whatsoever – a sign of a mature filmmaking. What Nitin Desai lacks in the acting department, he makes up for in what he is best at – the art direction. The entire film is set in Mumbai, and the film captures that. The houses, the streets, the rain, everything seems real. Not once do you get the feeling that any location is constructed, even though most of the film is shot on sets. (The only way I got to know that is because I stayed through the end credits, which lists only three locations - N. D. Studio, Film City and Gateway of India.) Also, the sound design and foley work are commendable - they gently ensure that the sounds capture the flavor of Mumbai.A special mention must go to maestro Illaiyaraaja, who has given the music for the film. Few men can come up with melodies that go with the moment or the occasion like the great man, and his music is an asset to this film. Be it the ‘Ganpati Ala’ track or the songs sung by Sukhwinder, Kailash Kher and Hariharan respectively, the music is from the soul - not the kind that would find its way into iPods across the nation, but the kind which one would not fast-forward while watching on DVD. One only wishes that Illaiyaraaja does more films, even if they are regional or offbeat. The film’s other major flaw (apart from Desai’s weak performance) is the screenplay. It tends to sag, especially in the latter half of the film. Most importantly, the pre-climax and the climax don’t do justice to the buildup. A stronger third act would have truly done wonders to this film. Still, the treatment, the backdrop of real events and its crisp under-two-hour-runtime make the film engaging for the most part. Ultimately, why this film worked for me is that even though it is far from perfect, Hello Jai Hind is honest and it emphatically shows us that Singham is NOT Kingam.

391,489,489,489,489,Her,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review3 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/her-review/,,3/5.0,,4.1,"Beautifully shot and acted, Spike Jonze’s Her touches a chord deep within, because it talks about one of humanity’s greatest fears – loneliness. Yet, it does so while always tickling you or charming you. A simple, powerful story of relationships, Her is a film that must not be missed.","Spike Jonze’s Her is primarily about loneliness. Everyone is connected to their computer at all times. But to each other? Not so much. Wide shots of public spaces show almost everyone walking by themselves, but look closely, and they are all talking. You’d be forgiven for thinking that they’re all on the phone with a loved one. In fact, there’s a good chance they’re all talking to their computers.Welcome to the future; where your computer runs your life even more than it does today; where operating systems have gotten so smart, they’re like a real live person to talk to; without a body, of course. In fact, it has become possible to develop a real relationship with them, with real feelings involved.And yet, how fruitful can such a relationship be? Will the fundamental disparity between man and machine be an obstacle? Will concepts like commitment, fidelity, romance, intimacy and the likes ever manifest themselves within the existential realm of machines? In this futuristic world, we are introduced to Theodore Twombly – the kind of man it is so easy to root for, yet one who seems to give off the air of desolate melancholy. A chance purchase – a brand new advanced operating system – introduces him to the unlikeliest of possible partners; his OS, who goes by the name Samantha. The film, visually bathed in golden glows and flares, gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling throughout, despite the fundamentally cold theme of loneliness; it is funny and heart-breaking in equal measure. As we observe Theodore and how his relationship with Samantha develops, we begin to see that such a relationship, between man and machine, actually seems not only possible, but also probable in the near future.There is a reason for Theodore’s loneliness, and there is a reason why Samantha is able to fulfill the gap, without being real in flesh and blood. Their relationship follows the most logical of paths, even though you’re never sure of whether you truly want to give your own personal stamp of approval to the relationship or not. The fact remains that the fundamental emotional needs of a human soul are unique to our species. No matter how far into the future we are, some things just will not change – the yearning for a warm hug, the need for physical companionship, the wish to have the one you love all to yourself – these are purely human traits, and nothing can change that.Joaquin Phoenix plays Theodore Twombly almost perfectly. Here is another actor – like Daniel Day Lewis and Christian Bale - who seems to morph into the character he’s playing almost always. He wins you over almost instantly, and yet, you can see why he is a lonely man. What makes his performance even more noteworthy is that he doesn’t have a physical presence to react to. Samantha the OS is voiced by Scarlett Johansson, who is a joy to hear. She tinges her voice with the right amount of naughtiness, playfulness and sexiness. Amy Adams, another chameleon when it comes to slipping into characters, plays Theodore’s friend, and she is so natural, it is hard to believe she is acting.But the true heroes of Her are the cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, whose shots make the film a visual joy, and writer-director Spike Jonze. If his Being John Malkovich and Adaptation were written by the maverick Charlie Kauffman, this time he goes completely solo. The narrative is far simpler than his previous films, and yet, that in no way implies that it doesn’t have deft touches and layers that enchant you. Her is a shining example of a simple, powerful concept with the right embellishments leading to a captivating film. Depending on how you look at it, it may leave you with a smile, or with a lump in your throat; either way, it is the kind of film that is hard to not be moved by.

392,490,490,490,490,Hercules,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/hercules-review/,,,,4.1,"Hercules begins and ends soon enough for it to be tolerable. Dwayne Johnson in the title roles is easy on the eyes, even if he's no Brando when it comes to the acting department. Just make sure you don't take the film too seriously.","Here's the thing - I'm unable to take Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson seriously when I watch him on the big screen; and I'm sure loads of people who've known him from his WWE days feel quite the same. Despite his sizeable fan following (which explains why the film opened quite well at the BO) and that he has tried hard to vary his choice of roles, one can't slide away the fact that owing to his muscular physique and affable screen presence, there are only certain kinds of roles he is chosen for, and he's about the same in all of them.Brett Ratner's take on Greek mythology's Hercules is adapted from a graphic novel, and truth be told, Dwayne Johnson sure suits the part. He looks almost superhuman, his sinews appearing capable enough to pull off some of the feats shown in the film.But, all said and done, Hercules is nothing more than VFX-heavy, testosterone-fuelled Hollywood sameness; their version of Kick, if you will.Oh, but there is actually a semblance of a plot in this film. Hercules, now in exile and a mercenary for hire, is brought in to defend the kingdom of Thrace from a mysterious invader. Things get murky, however, even as Hercules battles his own demons.Luckily enough, it doesn't seem like either Rayner or Johnson were taking this film too seriously, at least for the most. There's a bit of humour, loads of action and even more of Johnson playing to the gallery. The portions where it does seem like they were taking themselves seriously are, unsurprisingly, the weakest portions of the film.Mercifully, the film is brisk, and it has at least one twist that flags your interest when you begin to feel the monotony set in. And there's some decently executed close combat action, in addition to the grand battle scenes. Not the gorgeous, uber-stylish kind from 300, but more of the rugged, believable kind.The trick to not getting bored with a film like Hercules, then, is to play along with the lead actor and director, as they dish out a passable film. Don't expect too much, and Hercules at least won't make you regret watching it.

Whether or not Sooraj Pancholi can act though we will have to wait for another film to know. She is tall, she has flawless skin, she can pout. Whether or not Athiya Shetty can act though we will have to wait for another film to know. The good news though is that they aren't complete write-offs. Though it is suspicious that there are times when slow motion seemed to aid his swag and her pout even. But, you never know how things might turn out a couple of films later a la Alia Bhatt. Also, they barely have a chance at dialogue delivery in this film, given they have hardly  more than a line at a time to deliver. Almost as if the director knew that they wouldn't be able to handle it. Why a director with reasonable aptitude like Nikhil Advani agreed to make a film that is more or less a show reel for the starlings - whose parents weren't the greatest actors or even stars themselves – is beyond me. Whatever the reason might have been, that the dialogue was held at bare minimum gave a few “moment”s to the film. Though not sizzling, at times, there is a lingering charm about Sooraj Pancholi and Athiya Shetty's chemistry. Which is also why we can maybe hold judgment about them as actors for a couple more films. They aren't completely plastic as we have come to expect from new actors. Yet, they aren't natural. Through the film you think of them more in terms of whose kids they are in real life rather than the characters they play.The characters themselves barely have any facets or depth to them. Neither do any of the other aspects of writing. The story stays more or less like Hero (1983). Hero kidnaps heroine for whatever reason. Because they are hero and heroine they have to fall in love. How they drive overnight from Mumbai to a place where it snows is not a question we ask. Anyway, families don't like the alliance. Yadi-yada-da. We saw that 32 years ago and some versions of it before that and after. Sure, the lighting, the framing, the editing (especially that of the laser dance) is slick. But, the finale performance or even the fight sequence is lame again. It is striking that patronizing patriarchy has lived through the years. It was back then and it seems to be the norm – at least in many of our movies – even now. It is unnerving that the sole reason for the lead lady's existence in the film is so that she can be protected. It gives the men in her life something to do. Didn't make sense then, doesn't make sense now. Only now she is empowered enough to give away her shorts and mini skirts in an exchange offer for salwar suits to show that she is mourning. Oh well. Life goes on. The same movie still gets made. New faces, but no value addition to the film, no new stories. So used to expecting the same thing over and over again have we gotten, that we have even stopped getting bored watching them. You shrug, “what else did you expect” and move on.

Needless to say we encountered a lot of military camps, one such at 17100 feet above sea level. One question always haunts me - what makes a person decide he wants to stay away from his family, face death every day? What kind of passion drives him? Heroes makes an attempt to answer this question. Unfortunately, what started off very interestingly as a debate is only a camouflage leading us to a pre-determined conclusion.The stories of the three soldiers encompass all intimate relationships - spouse, siblings, and parents. And it does so well, by clearly defining each prominent member of the family. But, that can't be said about the two bikers who set out to meet these families, Sammy and Ali. There are very slight differences and the things that move or trigger their behavior are fuzzy.Anyway, the story is not as much about them as it is about what we can draw from the three families. Alas, only one story manages to touch you. The others are crippled by over-dramatization and predictability. The elegance beautifully seeping into interiors of Punjab is a real treat - especially since it's in such contrast with how loud Punjabis are usually depicted as in Hindi movies. Certainly, Preity Zinta's composed performance had a lot to do with how her story moves you.Soon enough, Sunny Deol takes over all the loudness that we were apparently missing. And from then on the narrative is downhill. Sunny Deol comes across as eccentric, but then again, his character was supposed to be eccentric. Having given that benefit of doubt too, it was a bit much to handle. This is followed by Mithun Chakraorty's story which had a lot of potential since he was the only affected character debating against people joining the army. But, it just didn't have the required vigor and enthusiasm to take the movie through to touchdown. The other culprit is the length of the movie. The forever, dragged on hugs just don't have a place in a movie like this. And it does become a bore when the subtlety gives way to long-winded spiels that shove patriotism down our throat. The slapsticky introduction of the bikers too, was absolutely out of tune with the rest of the movie. Not to mention the songs. Do we really have to see one Deol brother teach the other how to dance?! It requires courage to avoid the sleaze and the so-called glamour. Yet, Heroes does manage to raise a question and answers it, even if not convincingly. It gives us an opportunity to salute.Salutes to the heroes who lay down their lives for us. Salutes to their families who make sacrifices like it were their duty. Salutes to the bravery and to the pride.

","Welcome to the world of 'babes', one-upmanship, over-reaction. Welcome to the cut-throat world of the Hindi film industry, Bollywood. Or so you are made to believe. Heroine doesn't sink in any deeper than these two lines. However, like a Madhur Bhandarkar film, it does spend quite some time with its lead character, Mahi Arora (Kareena Kapoor). Mahi's character builds interestingly but unfortunately her story has nothing out of the ordinary to hold the film together. It's almost as if the character wasn't written but just happened to happen. It's great that Heroine picks not a typical top star as his lead character, nor is she a struggling actress who's rise we see from the very beginning. Her journey is told to us from somewhere in the middle. At a point in which she's most distraught and finds her way to a police station for a reason that is not told to us immediately and when you do find out, you can't believe the pettiness of the issue. I doubt the character or the writer/director knew why she was there. But meanwhile, Kareena Kapoor gets to insecure, distraught, failure, glamorous of course and bipolar! Though she seemed more depressed than bipolar, but hey that's nitty-gritty, right? But, the point here is that whatever Kareena is asked to do, she works really hard in getting it right. She looks gorgeous even when she is dispirited. And I mean this in a good way. She takes every opportunity she can get and the labor shows. It is not an effortless performance.The character offers her enough layers too - a woman who wants to do well in her career and is a decent human being too. But as it turns out, even if she is willing to put in her best, try everything within her control and resist from sinking low, it's not enough. And after all, she is a woman and thus is needy. There are other times, where Mahi behaves aggressively, over-reacts and takes actions the repercussions of which she hasn't taken into account. Interestingly, the only really good looking actress in the entire clutter of 'top' heroines in Heroine is Mahi. The rest, aren't half as magnificent. Yet, she struggles as a 'star', if not a beginner. For a change, you also have the male leads in sensitive roles, who have their own shades of gray, however unbaked they are. None of the other side characters add any meaning to the film except for maybe Shahana Goswami's Promita.With such textures, you'd hope the story would hold your interest. It meanders, it stretches, it disengages you from the characters. And towards the end it just gets overbearing. And at times, you feel like some sequences, especially ones revolving around sexuality, have been added just to titillate without much relevance to the story. The run-of-the-mill songs slow the film down too. The two and a half hours run-time doesn't help its case either. There is this underlying equation that Madhur Bhandarkar seems to point at, which is annoying as his audience, because it comments about the audience. While belittling the hard-work that people put in their work, Heroine implies that the entire film industry lives in a cut-throat environment where manipulation is the key to success. They do it to so their films do well with the masses. And the masses supposedly decide the fate of a film depending on the controversy surrounding it. Full stop. There is no if or but there, the question about the film's quality or content is a distant one. The audience's love for their cinema is based solely on the associated scandals. And what is poor media to do but to report on these with dramatic effect if that's what the audience wants. !?!? Really? Is that what we are? Naïve and basically stupid. Whatever. What it all boils down to then is the same question we could ask about most Bhandarkar products – Is Madhur Bhandarkar's Heroine about ""Bollywood - behind the scenes"" or is it telling us the story of its heroine, her ups, downs and in-betweens? If its the former, you'd get more out of reading your city's daily edition let alone film magazines. And if it's the latter, atypically so, Bhandarkar doesn't engage despite having his heroine perform to the best of her capabilities.

","You roll your eyes as you realise Heropanti is yet another ""love of my life"" vs. ""parental consent"" film. As the parents (read extended family) get more and more vicious your heart sinks because another realisation hits you - this happens in real life, even now. Unfortunately, for Heropanti, real life and decades of films on the topic had desensitized the audience to these issues in the 90s.  With nothing new to say and a hero who wears pink lipstick to the rescue, Heropanti becomes a 2.5 hour long, predictable drone. I think opening titles are an artform by themselves. Besides the creativity that goes into making them, they set the tone of a film. So, it was a huge turn-off when Heropanti had just the two lead actors' and director's names in the opening title. Not because it was short, but doesn't it show conceit? To me, that decision says how little the other team members mattered in the making of the film. I guess a bell should ring when you hear the name Tiger Shroff in a film called, ""Hero""panti and the popular tune from Subhash Ghai's film that shot Jackie Shroff (Tiger Shroff's father, for the uninitiated) to Hero status in the early 80s. Such tactics tell you upfront how strong the makers' confidence on the product itself is. Fair enough, they have tried to inject Hero-ness into Tiger Shroff by giving him some so-bad-that-they-are-good lines - which he delivers with as much style as is possible to make them look more fake and forced than they already are. Then of course, they are repeated so that we can tell that a scene is setup so that the line could be repeated.  Surrounded by such superficiality then, it is a miracle, that for a short while you get involved in the drama. You worry that the hero is in a tight spot and that he might get face brutal violence that you don't have the stomach for. That has to be because of the aura created around the villains. Uncharacteristically for the film, Prakash Raj's character, Chaudhary is grey enough to keep you interested. Of course, Prakash Raj, is relatively restrained and has you both worried for the hero and yet, you see yourself sympathizing with him, even if briefly. Unfortunately but not surprisingly, the writers do not capitalize on the emotion that this character evokes. As is expected, the women are pretty tools for the hero and the villain to fight over. Her love for the hero is taken for granted. Her father emotionally blackmails her into believing that she is his property and so on. But then again, that's what women in such situations face in real life. Also, in real life, starlets get a chance to play an action hero with various shades of pink on as lipstick. No, I cannot get over it. At the risk of sounding sexist for wanting to deprive men of cosmetics, such on-the-face make-up is unacceptable even for women. And you cannot escape the distraction for a minute because Tiger Shroff is in almost every scene (after his entry). Not that one was expecting great shakes from a film called Heropanti. But, that the makers, with a 100% fresh starcast don't even attempt to break any mould is disheartening. In fact, they try to milk the popularity of a 20-year old film. Just sad.

Interestingly though, the second half is taken over mostly by my kind of good subtle humor. And that's what makes this one worth a DVD rental.","I marvel at how little time a story writer can spend on his characters. A 1-in-3 character will do (1 personality in 3 characters, duh!?) when there are shaking hips and comedy to take its place. Absolutely run-of-the-mill slapstick is in-charge of the first half of the movie. Interestingly though, the second half is taken over mostly by my kind of good subtle humor. And that's what made this one worth it for me. Who needs narratives when we have Akshay Kumar's 3-minute description of 3 characters, right? As Akshay's voiceover started annoying me, I let my mind wander around...(Sort-of random thought – Maybe slapstick was meant to be silent, you know - Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or even Mr. Bean - one element less to irritate me.)...people around me are whistling and hooting at every single barely-clad woman who comes on screen...(Random thought - I am touched! Not only the writer/director, but the audience too has immense respect for women.)...back to slapstick. Someone is reading my sort-of random thought. Words are replaced by a typical comedy feature - a fast forward action set to loud and pacy background music. No-no - I am not saying I wanted to see it at a slower pace (Gawd, NO!). Why does our new breed of directors need to resort to this cumbersome technique? Has all that needs to be explored in editing techniques been explored? I am sure there was a day and age when this was absolutely hilarious, but don't we need a little more than this to make us laugh? Maybe not. The full house (at an 8.45 AM show) was laughing its heart out. And they laughed again - the second time this technique was used in the span of 15 minutes...(More random thought – Whose fault is it that I am doing all this random thinking? Since I refuse to blame it on a human being, I blame it on the inimitable art of repetition.)...Oh wow! Barely-clad women gone!! Does Sajid Khan have a random-thought-reading contraption? Well, I know I do - exactly what I expect is happening on screen. And the few times the story is not predictable, they have left out explanations altogether. Anyway, cut to song...(Not-so random thought – There should be a better way of expressing, ""this child has changed my life"" than -

Suddenly, I have interesting and non-repetitive dialogues. Wow! Actual tongue-in-cheek humor, tangy one-liners!! Though the super-melodrama is here to stay, I am ecstatic that the movie is getting better and am laughing out really loud...(Not-at-all random thought - The more randomly I think, the better the movie gets. Maybe, it's my wandering mind that is making the movie improve. Or maybe I shouldn't start taking credit just yet)...oh, this is an interesting style of narration. Huge chunks of the story are narrated just by way of dialogue and finished off in five minutes. And huge chunks of time are taken to narrate the slow-moving parts of the story. Even-paced movies generally are better at retaining my attention, but interesting style nevertheless...(Back to random thought - Am I getting more responsive as Baby Johaina is getting more responsive? She is doing a good job of acting. Oh wait, no-one can make an 8-month old act. She is a natural!)...oops, what's wrong with Vidya Balan? Why is she so stiff, no body language? Where did she learn this non-acting? Hopefully, not from Fardeen Khan. On the other hand, Ritiesh Deshmukh is the regular amount of tolerable, and Akshay Kumar's comic timing is awesome in some of the scenes. But the star is Babyy Johaina - her expressions are the best...(Real random thought - When the universe was made how many more senses were generated. What were they? How were the current five (six?) chosen and why were the others discarded?)...yep, that's how uninteresting the climax is...This one would have been an absolute dud for me but for the comedy post-interval.

Thankfully, it is engaging while it lasts.","Much like Naina (Rani Mukerji) starts her class by addressing her speech difficulty upfront, Hichki begins with the exposition of Tourette’s syndrome and gets it out of the way. After that the film becomes more about a teacher’s struggle to bring her set of economically-underprivileged students up-to-speed with the rest of the students in that grade and a fight between old and new teaching mehods. In that sense, Hichki is about equal opportunity for those with speech difficulties and financial ones. Hichki questions our perceptions about disabilities. Hichki questions the very methods we use to teach. Hichki questions the elitist attitude towards education. Interestingly, the first is turned into a metaphor for everything that’s wrong with the other two. But, this would have worked if it was used once or twice in the film, the repeated use of Tourette as a metaphor everything that is wrong with a person’s thought process becomes tiring and maybe even beats the purpose of trying to sensitize the audience to the issue. Kudos to Hichki, to that effect, because it sensitizes the audience in other ways – by not letting the syndrome come in the way of Naina’s efforts with her students, by giving it little to no attention after the exposition, by letting it become just a part of a person’s regular being, Hichki makes the acceptance really smooth. As sad as it is, this acceptance works against the film because then it becomes a regular ol’ underdog film. There’s hardly any creativity in narrating that story. Also, characters that had potential to be interesting turn out to be rather predictable. It is holier-than-thou preachy versus smug nastiness. There are few insights but they are too fleeting to have an impact. On the other hand, I prefer fleeting to rub-it-in-your-face-to-make-sure-you-get-it (like the end credits eyeroll!) Similarly, other than the insights, insightful lines exist but they are few and far betweent too. In fact, post-interval the film becomes dialogue-heavy and over-written. This takes over the otherwise wonderful performances too. Except for Rani Mukerji, the rest of cast shifts gears while delivering the mouthful of dialogue, thankfully not enough to let us forget they are great actors. As for Rani Mukerji you forget that Naina is actually a character in a film and not an earnest, idealistic teacher and person, tic or no tic. A special shout out to the child artist who played Naina, she tore me up in her brief appearance. The post-interval syndrome is seen in narrative style too. I was beaming with happiness that Naina’s backstory wasn’t a voiceover but they actually weaved it in through story-showing rather than story-telling. But then they spoilt it by closing with a voiceover. Uggh. But then again, what is it that we can expect from ‘a rise of the underdog’ film? You can’t really have the underdog lose it all. If the underdog loses a bit and not all, we would say that was just a token loss. Yet, it is not too much to ask for a non-preachy, ‘you are so dumb to teach Math/Science this way’ approach. It is just another way of one group dehumanising and looking down at another group. In that sense, you can almost tell why the speech disability is important for the film – to distract you from the plain-ness of the story. And for the metaphors, of course.

399,497,497,497,497,Highway,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/highway-2015-review/,,,,4.3,"Even a downright-simple idea, minus standard narrative structure, could be an intriguing journey.","A 30-something, corporate executive and his pregnant wife argue endlessly on their road journey. As this light spat prolongs for more than one would expect, I start wondering where this ride is headed. He is stuck in the rat race, while she is a god-fearing, saas-bahu-drama-addict. Her words make him a usual, oppressive husband, but she appears no less than a drama queen either. Their actions speak louder than their words. This isn’t the case with the couple alone, but the other characters as well. But just when you feel like you know these people inside out, Highway shows you the other side of the story. It shows you why objects in stories, real or reel (digital in this case), can be contrary to what they appear. The couple's mode of conciliation, or silencing the other is beyond one’s imagination or conventional sense. No wonder I’m still laughing my guts out as I recall the moment.When a movie has more than 35 characters, it either ends up getting very complicated or over-simplified. To start with, a myriad of subplots, involving diverse characters and sub characters during a single journey, means taking the road less travelled. Especially since, all these characters come from different walks of life. Each one of them has a different social, cultural and emotional background than the other. They have their respective needs as well. In addition, these intricate layers are laid out humorously, while still sticking to its principal voice - one needs seasoned hands at helm. Who else is better suited to do that than Girish Kulkarni (writing) and Umesh Kulkarni (direction)? It doesn’t surprise me seeing the Kulkarni brothers, as I fondly call them, do it almost perfectly.A young guy comes out of a Bombay chawl, with a skyscraper in the backdrop, as the flick opens with some tense musical score. It could probably be a way of depicting social divergence. No matter how great it would be in context, I find it irrelevant though. Moving on, you encounter seemingly regular individuals with easily-identified traits. And this is a key behind Highway’s staunch realism. So when you see an impatient NRI treating his driver unkindly, you are quickly familiar with him. Not because we see NRIs that way, but because Girish’s portrayal alone says a lot about his backstory than when he himself reveals it later. Girish is so outstanding that with each film he is raising the bar, be it scripting or acting. I am already looking forward to Jau Dya Na Balasaheb, his directorial debut. Fingers crossed!Thanks to the detailed treatment it requires, almost half of the runtime occupies setting up of characters. But thoughtful writing ensures that you stay hooked even without the typical guidelines. Strangely enough, Highway doesn’t really have a one-line plot. Several elements come together as a coherent force, making it seem like there is some sort of spoken or unspoken central story. As we observe our own reflections in these characters, we feel convinced about that illusion. The trick works. Of course, that’s the beauty of symbolism, philosophy and our perception. Yet, I was sorely let down by too-much-revealing dialogue with which characters divulge their thoughts rather than letting me figure them out. Communication is not bad, but they do sound overly obvious and contextually repetitive in certain cases.Highway is crammed with an endless list of stellar actors. It is tough (but also a shame) that each one’s contribution cannot be mentioned here. Quite a few characters act outlandishly all of a sudden in the end, while some of them don’t really influence the narrative. Despite these forced, flawed character developments though, the performances stay with you. The same goes for lots of subtle details that add significance in a broad sense.Camera ensures both chaos and composure, maintaining the mood of the given situation. Though the photography isn't necessarily impressive, it pretty much does what a scene requires. The sound design, along with terrific songs, complements the visuals flawlessly. I am tapping my feet in one moment and feeling grief in another. But the sound is not always perfect here. A dialogue happening outside a car sounds the same as you would here it from the car. Either it could be a technical glitch at the theatre or a creative liberty. The first one doesn’t seem likely, while the second one makes little sense. Fortunately, though it is important, it isn’t a defining one in your perceiving of the film.The climax though, is a lovely way to end the journey, or give rise to a new one. While we’re thrusting on the highway of life, we seem to be moving ahead. But just like the characters in the film, all of us are actually trapped within. We’re more worried about reaching the destination than relishing the journey. B. R. Tambe’s famous verse is a metaphorical tribute to that. It’s an expedition of inner discovery, something very hard to articulate. And there is no preachiness involved. The Kulkarnis let you discover that. As a result, the film’s strange posters with an even stranger tagline make profound sense.Highway is not the first of its kind. It isn’t perfect either. But a very few manage to break the barriers of ‘art vs mainstream’ as lucidly as this one does. Such a rarity!

","When was the last time you stumped yourself? When was the last time you bumped into something and enjoyed it, something that you never imagined would give you pleasure? That feeling of newness, that blissful ecstasy, why would you want to ever let go of that? This is what you experience with Veera (Alia Bhatt). You experience her pain too. Yet, Highway leaves you a little wanting and doesn't make you a part of its journey, 100%. Alia Bhatt is gorgeous. I had to say that out first. It's not the Barbie doll look from Student of the Year, it's not her cuteness, she is a gorgeous actor. If you'd have told me after watching her debut that she can fill the screen with her presence, making me feel her pain and exuberance equally (in one shot, that too!), I wouldn't have scoffed at you, but I would've snickered internally for sure. From the first shot you can tell this young lady means business - Her disdain and genuine boredom are apparent and then she takes you along with her, through a myriad of emotions. Her comic timing is perfect. Some of her lines could have sounded so silly, if they weren't delivered with the ease that she has being Veera. And for Veera alone you could watch Highway. She's crazy, not eccentric. She's bound by society's ""good girl"" tag and doesn't realise she could feel as free she feels when she's kidnapped accidentally. There are a couple of scenes that point at social menaces that need to be addressed pronto. I hate to undermine their importance, but these scenes do seem a little out-of-place within the context of the film. They disconnect you from Veera's journey though they are an integral part of it. Surely, Alia Bhatt cannot be blamed for that, her long (background-score-less!) shots in these scenes are something I haven't seen in a long time. The disconnect is more to do with how it's placed in the film. Individually, the scenes are great but when they run as a part of the story, they look like they've come out of the blue. Similarly, even though Randeep Hooda has done a wonderful job with his brooding, disgruntled, helpless, contract killer Mahaveer, the chemistry is missing as a couple. Maybe this disjointed chemistry is intentional, they are an unlikely couple - a hooligan from a village and a city-bred, rich girl belonging to a well-known and powerful family. Yet, for a romance to kick in, for you to root for it and not the individual characters, you need to believe they are in love with each other - this is missing in Highway.Highway's beauty, along with the mesmerizing landscapes and minimal use of background music (and lovely folklore when it is used), is its pace. It is slow and keeps you engaged. It builds up piece by piece and the individual characters grow on you gradually. But, such pace is not everyone's cup of tea. I would really love to see the film once again without the cackling from the audience. Interestingly though, the audience is paying enough attention to laugh out loud at some of the brilliant one-liners and is equally attentive when the intense ""social message"" scenes come on. It is likely that Imtiaz Ali, the writer might have wanted to focus on the message while keeping it wrapped in a warm yet emotionally violent story. But it is the other message that charmed me better. It is not new, it is not profound, but it held me glued - that freeing your spirit can show you how you are in charge and yet, to free your spirit, you need to take charge.

Besides, the plot details are either missing or incoherent.","Had it been one of the first few thrillers ever, Hijack would've been exciting. But, with all the logistical gaps and happy coincidences, it is far, far away from making your nerves jitter.Not that characterizations are first on priority in most action thrillers, but all the characters including the main ones in this one are mere outlines. Let alone having shades to add depth, only one color is chosen for each of them. Especially annoying was Priya (Capt. Vikram's daughter) who is so cheerful despite the most trying circumstances. So strong is this 8-10 year old that she is all smiling on her way to the hostel for the first time even though her father can't control a tear from rolling down his eye. In a movie where almost everything is below mediocre, you don't really expect the best lines for the characters. But, airport ground staff spewing philosophy at a passenger while checking him in is a bit too much. Considering the one-line character sketches and the lame lines, most actors seem to have done a decent job of smiling and being scared. The logic and logistics of the writing too were haphazard. A terrorist gang is so meticulous about planning, that a gun is planted into a chips packet to enter the airport and it reaches fine. But, they take a flight to Amritsar, when they want to go to Dubai without thinking about fuel replenishment! Not all is completely bad. There are a couple of subtle scenes which add flavor to the particular sequence. Like the little boy fetching a phone for a senior terrorist at a rugged training center implying that children were being trained there too. This scene replaces the kids-crawling-under-barbed-wire drill which is customary in showcasing such camps.I really wonder what purpose is served by generic lyrics set to regular music, picturized with aerobic-style choreography? The story certainly doesn't need them. If the producer needs them for commercial success, I certainly hope the audience is not fooled by a supposed-Brazalian miming Hindi. Hijack is the 'leave your brains behind' kind of an action-thriller, Just like slapstick is a kind of comedy. Slapsticks don’t make you laugh, Hijack has neither creative action nor manages to thrill.

You know its going to range from garish to extremely over-the-top, it being a Sajid Khan ""entertainer"". With the ""the 80s are back"" announcement, you knew you had to leave your brain behind. Yet, somehow Himmatwala makes it worse than what you are ready for - from the righteous brave-heart to the idealistic mother to the caricaturish villain to the supposedly village setting to the lousy one-liners, there isn't one moment that can hook you in.To start off, in its attempt to not copy the 1983 film, the 2013 version brings in  a few minor changes and a 'twist' which make the proceedings even more lame. Then you have Ravi (Ajay Devgn) cracking the poorest of poor jokes. Making him admit the awfulness in the very next line, only makes it worse (and when we thought it wasn't possible.)Similarly, Paresh Rawal breaking the fourth wall asking us to come towards him and go away from him with a  zooming in and out camera isn't funny to begin with. It gets even more tiresome when its repeated over and over, predictably. When you are so clearly reminded that you are watching a film, you cannot be expected to get remotely involved in the characters or the situations. So involved are Sajid Khan and company in not taking themselves seriously, that the villain doesn't scare and the hero doesn't inspire or invoke allegiance. All the supposedly powerful and/or emotional scenes seem lame because you aren't engaged in the story.Interestingly, Ravi's sister (Leena Jumani) gets a scene where she uncharacteristically takes charge of her life and it could imply a superficial hint at woman empowerment. But her action ultimately implies submission to what others in her life decide for her. Even if you'd like to give Himmatwala a benefit of doubt in that the social norms of the 80s apply, you realize you are being asked to believe that any of this is realistic. Having said that, Leena Jumani is an actor who sticks out because of how quietly she plays her bit. In contrast you have this gang of very capable actors competing to look more idiotic than the next. You cannot blame Paresh Rawal, Mahesh Manjrekar or even Ajay Devgn for not making you laugh. Their timing seems to be perfect for what they've been asked to do. But, what they've been asked to do is so ridiculously not funny that you don't know what to feel for them. I would like to think that my 10-year old is too old for such juvenile non-humor. You know you have stooped to a new low when you find relief when the songs from the 80s start playing. Relief in nostalgia from 'nayano mein sapna' and ' taaki o taaki' - yep, certainly a low! I'd like to shift the blame to having to sit through 'thank God it's Friday' and 'bum pe laat' in comparison. I do questions myself, ""Why do I even bother with such films?"" ""Hope and curiosity"", besides the fact that I have taken it up as a job. I hope that there will be something, at least one scene, that's worth half-a-watch and I don't want to keep wondering what that'll be. However, feeble my reward be, Sajid Khan's Himmatwala has this curiously shot hypothetical situation in which he, for reason unknown, chooses to refer to Psycho. Not that I liked it or the way it was done, but it was very atypical of Sajid Khan. And that is enough for me, even if not good enough to recommend you watch it even if you have nothing better to do (unless your hope and curiosity are compelling).Himmatwala truly has nothing that even people reminiscing the 80s would enjoy.

403,501,501,501,501,Hindi Medium,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/hindi-medium-review/,,3/5.0,,4.3,"The film uses mildly-comical satire to put its point across. However, the problem arises when writers fail to wrap it up as satire and succumb to sermonizing.","If you have seen its trailer then you already know the major plot points of Hindi Medium. Perhaps you also know that it is a message-driven film. What pulls you into the theater, however, is the promise of witnessing satisfying performances by a carefully assembled cast. The good news is that the promise is fulfilled, not entirely but mostly.  But, the performances would be lackluster if not for good writing. And In that department, the dialogs and screenplay both come out as clear winners. The dialogs are tickling and the screenplay is engaging. The story focuses on carrying out a gentle, gradual but thorough exposé of our school system, particularly the problems and practices arising out of an over-competitive admission process. The screenplay deserves full marks for using this particular subject as a knife to cut a cross-section through the strata of urban India, exposing how a child's education is perceived and approached in the middle, lower-middle and upper-middle classes. It uses mildly-comical satire to put this point across. However, the problem arises when writers fail to wrap it up as satire and succumb to sermonizing. This is the film's biggest flaw. There was no need of a sermon because the gravity had been amply demonstrated otherwise. It could have remained a tale of quiet realization, introspection, and transformation. Why declare one's transformation in public? Perhaps, because we are used to making heroes out of our protagonists. And a protagonist isn't heroic enough if it does not go all preachy. Also, I guess, we suffer from the need to cleanse ourselves of our misdoings by holding someone (the system) responsible. We pick a figure of authority and put all the blame on it. I feel sad that the film felt the need to create a semi-villain when the real problem is our own aspiration. Other relatively less unpleasant flaws include: 
a) The compulsion to include songs, even if a couple, and even if as part of the background score. The poetry of their lyrics doesn't blend with the matter-of-fact approach of the screenplay. And
b) A general lack of cinematographic exploration in the film. It is evenly and brightly lit, and a happy, comedic mood prevails through say eighty percent of the film. Which makes it easy on the eyes, but makes it less hard-hitting than it could have been.In the department of performances, Irrfan Khan is effortless although it seems he has been typecast--you have seen him in similar acts before. But I guess, very few actors possess the prowess to look the part as well as remain distanced enough to convey satire. That quality makes him a perfect choice for this role.
Saba Qamar's lisp takes some getting used to, but she soon slides into her character and snap-fits into it. She handles a variety of demanding scenes well, most of which appear in the 'poverty' act.
Deepak Dobriyal brings authenticity to his part of optimistic lower-middle-class man, Tillotama Shome surprises with her elite act, and Swati Das deserves a bouquet of roses for her short but noticeable performance. 
Amrita Singh is a superb choice for her cameo but oddly the writers have made her look more feeble than powerful. Most of the extras look like...well... extras--positioned in the background to fill up space, sometimes embarrassingly clueless, sometimes well-briefed. Sadly though, Neha Dhupia's and Sanjay Suri's cameos are also reduced to an 'extra' performance. :(Overall, Hindi Medium had the potential to be an impactful film but for various reasons mentioned above, it doesn't fare more than a good-for-one-time watch. So, those really keen on witnessing congenial writing and performances should watch it in theaters, others can wait for the DVD/TV release.

404,502,502,502,502,[The] Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/hobbit-unexpected-journey-review/,,5/5.0,,6.3,"Gargantuan in scale and vision, the first of Peter Jackson’s The Hobbit trilogy is more of a set-up piece for the remaining films. Unhurried in its pace, the film introduces the enchanting world, the eccentric characters and the adventures that they will eventually face. With rich detailing, immaculate art and terrific 3D, the film makes for a good theatrical watch, but there will certainly be complaints that the first Hobbit film doesn’t nearly pack in as much excitement as any of the LOTR films.","Update: While filmmakers have been shooting at higher frame rates for quite a while now, this is the first time that an entire feature film is being projected theatrically at 48 frames per second, dubbed as HFR for projection purposes. (Currently, only select INOX theatres and Sathyam in Chennai are HFR-ready.) Experiencing The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey in HFR 3D has its pros and cons. It works well in action sequences and in shots where there is camera movement. The higher 48 FPS frame rate means that motion becomes far smoother and action is easier to watch. However, 48 FPS also seems to improve image clarity, which often makes it easy to discern shots where the lighting is artificial and where sets/VFX are used. Simply put, filmmakers will have to be far more careful if they intend to continue using HFR in the future. More effort will be required to seamless blend live action and locations with CG. As far as The Hobbit is concerned, there will be those who complain that HFR looks 'too much like video'. For most, the overall experience will seem far more familiar and enjoyable in regular 24 FPS, which our eyes are so accustomed to. Personally speaking, I will not dismiss HFR so early on in its existence, considering that I got goose-bumps at exactly the same places while watching it the second time round in HFR, as I did the first time when I watched it in good ol' 24.My best friends are Ron and Hermione. My name, of course, is Harry Potter. But even I would have to admit that ‘The Lord of the Rings’ is arguably the greatest bit of fantasy writing in history. Brought to life by Peter Jackson’s stunning vision in the form of his cinematic trilogy, the films themselves occupy a rare pedestal when it comes to films adapted from literature. Now, Jackson is back. With the first of his trilogy of films based on The Hobbit, the prequel to J R R Tolkien’s most famous epic, Jackson transports us back to the magical Middle-Earth; a world of dragons and Dwarves, of wizards and Orcs. A 3D world of fantasy and adventure, one so breathtaking that it engulfs you, if you are willing to let go. Bilbo Baggins the Hobbit is happy in his hole and his world, until adventure comes knocking in the form of Gandalf the wizard and a motley crew of Dwarves. As we are introduced to the conflict in the Dwarves’ history and why this journey is necessary for them to undertake, the reluctant Bilbo is drawn into it as well, and the barmy pack of characters set off for an intriguing hunt for gold and the pursuit of the dragon Smaug. Linear and fairly simplistic in its narrative, this first film primarily acts as a preamble for the grandeur and excitement of the adventures that the two subsequent films will doubtlessly hold. As Gandalf mysteriously tells Bilbo, “I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure…” what he is really doing is asking us, the viewers, to join him in the world that Tolkien’s and Jackson’s respective imaginations have created.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is primarily held together by bewitching imagery embellished with remarkable 3D; the film virtually transports you to Middle-Earth. The eccentric characters and the comic tone of the film are charming, and are helped greatly by the performances. Martin Freeman takes little time to shake off any image you have of him as Watson from BBC’s contemporary Sherlock adaptation and slips into the role of the younger Bilbo with ease. His mannerisms and expressions are perfect, and infinitely more likeable than that of Elijah Wood, who appears in a very brief reprisal of his role as Frodo. For hardcore LOTR fans, there are also cameos by Elrond (Hugo Weaving), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) and the likes, not to mention Andy Serkis’ deliciously twisted, motion-capture return as Gollum. My personal favourite, of course, is Ian McKellen’s Gandalf the Grey. The thespian, as always, brings that air of mystique and indefatigable character that is Gandalf the wizard. His disappearances and reappearances bring about a sense of alternating loss and reassurance, of magical involvement with Bilbo and the Dwarves who depend so much on the towering presence that the character has. Undeniably, the film works more to make you reminisce about the far more frenetic and heart-pounding experience of the earlier trilogy, because the film suffers from one big problem that is hard to ignore when you gauge it objectively. While personally, the leisurely pace of the film didn’t bother me because I enjoyed the vicarious fantastical experience that I was offered, there will undoubtedly be those who will find the pace of the film tedious. Only those truly taken in by Tolkien-verse will fully be able to appreciate the film. Whether the film will work for you or not depends entirely on how much you like involving yourself in the experience that is cinema.The Lord of the Rings was a novel just shy of 1400 pages, and it took three movies to make a respectable cinematic adaptation of it. The Hobbit, in comparison, isn’t even 300 pages long and is still being made into three movies. Crudely put, each ‘Hobbit’ film has just about one-fifth of how much each LOTR film had. The choice to make three films out of the book, then, seems more financially driven than creatively. After all, each film is most certainly going to rake in billions worldwide.But those concerns are for the practical, the rational and the cynical. For those who love living characters and mentally inhabiting places of enigma and fantasy, An Unexpected Journey works well. The songs of the Dwarves, the quirks of our lovable Hobbit, Gandalf’s immense aura and the obstacles that they face along their journey will enchant you. Jackson’s assured hand at recreating the world that he is so clearly besotted by more than most, makes some scenes and set pieces truly stand out. The familiar background score, very reminiscent of the LOTR films, aids further in making you live that world.Also, what the film really does is set things up nicely for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and The Hobbit: There and Back Again. In the larger scheme of things, when one wants to revisit the Tolkien-Jackson universe years later, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is where they would start, and it is a worthy introduction to the world of magic and adventure that they will be sucked into over the nearly 20 hours of cinema that they will eventually experience.

","Strange that just a year ago, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was easily the most awaited film of the year, while the second film of the trilogy, The Desolation of Smaug, has arrived with not more than a whimper in comparison. Luckily, the film more than lives up to the promise shown by the first film, which, while being an engaging visual and emotional experience in itself, was more of a set up piece than anything else. What is it about watching a bunch of souls on a dangerous quest for something that they believe in, the moral questions behind it be damned? What is it about the most basic concepts like courage, brotherhood, good and evil, which make a well-told story involving them become so immersive?Yes, the Tolkien adaptations have the advantage of being adequately armed with fodder for spectacularly inviting imagery, but surely that can't be all? Surely it is more about the emotions evoked than about breathtakingly executed visuals?   This time, we rejoin Gandalf, Bilbo, Thorin and his band of Dwarves - less merrier this time round - as they continue on their quest that began in the previous film. Their destination, of course, is Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, where lies the great dreaded dragon, Smaug. Their journey, however, is fraught with peril.What makes The Desolation of Smaug so much more engaging is that it is far darker than An Unexpected Journey, which actually had so much of understated humour in it. It also is far quicker paced, and it completely ups the action and adventure set pieces; so much that the first film actually seems rather tame in comparison.Watch out, in particular, for one terrific, high-octane sequence involving Orcs, Elves, Dwarves and a raging river. It is easily one of the most jaw-droppingly imagined action scenes of the year - even better than the one where Wolverine had a bit of fun on the top of a Bullet Train earlier this year. This scene, and indeed, so many others in the film, make your heart surge quite like the river that was mentioned earlier. It helps that the 3D this time is even better. What remains to be seen is how this film looks in HFR.The Desolation of Smaug also takes a lot more liberties with the source material than the previous film, but then that's something for only hardcore Tolkien fans to talk about. As far as it being the intermediate film in the trilogy goes, it is a bit of a roller coaster, giving you almost no time to breathe as the Dwarves and Bilbo hurtle towards their showdown with Smaug.And when Smaug is finally shown in all his glory; well, what can one say? Superbly voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, Smaug the dragon has been designed and executed with such persona and awe that it is hard to take your eyes off him. If Gandalf and Thorin were the scene-stealers in An Unexpected Journey, The Desolation of Smaug belongs to Smaug.It won't be surprising, however, if the film manages to exhaust at least some part of the audience. The fact remains that it hardly ever eases up on the action, and most of the action scenes are quite long as well. The film, despite its fast pace, would have been far more appreciated if it was shorter - at least a couple of action scenes chopped out would surely not have hurt. While I'm personally not complaining - l loved every bit of the high energy portions of the film - it would have perhaps made more sense for the film to be slightly less bloated with all that action. Remember, Jackson has already been under fire for making a relatively tiny book into three whole films. Luckily, the film ends on a high - you're left with bated breath for the final chapter of the trilogy. Danger is brewing in Middle Earth, and The Desolation of Smaug literally leave you right at the brink of it. If Peter Jackson now intends to take the adventure up a notch, then The Hobbit: There and Back Again is poised to be a true epic.Update: HFR Viewing This time round, Peter Jackson and Co seem to have taken cognizance of and fixed at least some of the issues that An Unexpected Journey had with its HFR. In The Desolation of Smaug, the 'fakeness', which was a major complaint about the look of the first film, has actually gone down. That TV-like quality because of the sharpness and smooth frame rate is also lesser. And of course, the big plus point of HFR - better visibility in fast action scenes - works well for this film, which has enough action going for it. All in all, HFR isn't quite perfect yet, but baby steps are being made, in case filmmakers are serious about it as a long-term technical innovation in cinema.

","After the initial ""let's get your attention, so you are in your seat"" romantic track, Holiday surprises you with  a decent, thickening plot between an army officer and terrorists. But, as it goes with this genre in Hindi, there are way too many plot holes. And even if you ignore them, there are too many side-tracks in the form of songs and sub-plots to take the film seriously.You have a lead lady (Sonakshi Sinha) who can box, pole vault, play rugby, run, do karate while the lead actor woos her.  In the one song that focuses on her as a character, the main point seems to be Akshay Kumar's dance moves. Come to think of it, I don't think any song has her even lip-syncing. Looks like comic relief ain't enough no more, you need romantic relief. Speaking of which, Govinda is such a misfit and/or waste as comic relief here.These come across as fillers with the intention of selling a product that you are not confident about. Add to the mix, desperate stylisation of the hero and dialogue that doesn't belong. Which is such a shame because despite the gaps in logic and logistics the plot is not half bad.  Akshay Kumar fans then might find some respite in the Akshay Kumar-ness of the film. While I have no clue exactly what such a fan looks for, I'd say the actions scenes are cool while they last, though there aren't way too many of them. Hope that helps. On the other hand though, there is hardly any challenge for him from the other side. Both, the villain character and actor are just too dull to make you want to root one way or the other. Thematically too, Holiday tends to get into the preachy zone, almost reprimanding you for not appreciating the efforts of soldiers at the border. Yet, I'd call my 3 hours in the movie hall a success, considering it is nowhere bad to what I expected it to be. Do I give a film extra points for that? Naah. It is just what it is. A casual TV watch if you chance upon it.

Acting is super. I had a few problems with the characterisation. Would have been better, if there wasn't a forced story for every couple.","The first half is hil-larious! There are really funny lines and situations in the second half too, but the compulsion to have a story breaks the flow. Nevertheless, all the laughs were the perfect medicine for my horrible cold. Yeah-yeah, I know my illness was not on their mind when they were making the movie, just thought I’d let you know because I felt like it. Just like, the writer threw in special effects, or her stand on social issues.Comedies like these bring out the dependencies between the dialogues and the comic timing. The great performances wouldn’t mean anything without the witty lines. And as always, funny lines cannot tickle you if they are not delivered right. Someone please tell me, why don’t real radio jockeys speak this sensibly? It’s the serious parts (mostly in the first half hour after interval) where things drag. They do not gel with the general tone at all. The side-side story of the driver is out of place too. And the preachy tone in the end – Why? Why?? Why??? Also, why does the screenplay slacken in the second half.Acting by one and all is exactly what their characters demand. Yes, even Amisha Patel! When I first heard that she was playing a loud character, I was dreading the time I would see this movie. But, her restraint comes as a pleasant surprise. There are too many artistes to name them all here, but everyone has done their roles full justice.  And so have the costumes of at least some of the people. I was really kicked by how the geek was almost always dressed in a solid-colored collared T-shirt.Most of the characters and their idiosyncrasies were dealt a fair hand. I especially liked how the sexual orientation of some of the characters was handled sans the usual snickers associated with such issues in Hindi movies. A whole range of honeymooners is covered here, from the chauvinist who is more interested in photography than his wife to the couple who had no use for a camera, from the arranged marriage to the love marriages. While most characters are consistent, there are a few that leave you with questions. Since, discussing these would give out a little more than I like, check out the details section (spoilers there!). The songs look better than they sound. They are the kind that grow on you because you have seen them. The choreography of “pyar ki ek kahaani” is absolutely breathtaking.This movie has a very Hrishikesh Mukherjee feel to it. And that says a lot coming from a huge Hrishi-da fan. This is certainly the kind of light movie we needed after a series of serious movies we have seen in the last four weeks. If only, Reema Kagti had not worried so much about trying to squeeze in an actual story for every couple.

Yet it has no speeches and has a very subtle narration style. Worth a cozy DVD watch.,"A movie set around the 9/11 bomb blasts and no overt messages being lectured across the screen! It’s about Indians staying abroad, yet none of the typical cultural drama related to diaspora. Okay, I know this sounds like I liked the movie more because of what it was not, rather than for what it was. But, this movie is a simple love story set in the middle of the Hindu-muslim divide prevalent in the South Asian community settled in the US.In about 75 minutes, four characters and their situation are all developed reasonably well. In fact, in just two adorable scenes the romance Ali (Amit Sial) feels for his beloved is established. Also, director, Tanuja Chandra makes a very smart move by not telling us much about the relationship between Saloni (Mahima Choudhary) and Harry (Vikram Chatwal). It adds to the believability of what is to follow.Situations transitioned from one to another very subtly without too many dialogues. Characters were smart enough to understand the situation without the other having to spell it out for them. The audience too was treated with respect and not spoon-fed. I realized that I've become so used to melodrama when I felt relief at every point where melodrama could have been so easily resorted to. There were a couple of times when an awkward situation is built up to a pregnant pause, to be resolved with a simple one liner - straight just as is, without any ham-haw-ing. Having said that, a couple of character transitions happened a bit too quickly and thus tilted towards unbelievable. This could also be because the focus seemed to be on narrating the over-simplified story rather than presenting it from a particular character's point of view. This I thought is what created a certain distance between the characters and the audience. But, at most times you felt for the characters because of sincere performances from the entire cast. It was so refreshing to see Anupam Kher in a role that has his name written all over it. The pride, the joy, the grief, the hatred are all translucent for you to see through. Your hearts reach out to Mahima and Amit too. And I think this is the first time I have seen so many expressions on Suhasini Mulay's, otherwise stiff face. Like the style of narration, the camerawork was also subtle with minimal movements. Also, the colors used had a dull, yet realistic, hue. There were no bright colors staring at your face. In fact, the colors almost matched the stock footage used of the 9/11 blasts.Hope and a little sugar is a short and sweet story told well. The characters are charming and their treatment is thought out. But yet, there is this weird gap left by unexplained and super-quick transformations in characters and situations.

Be it a haunted house, hotel, hospital or graveyard - there is a discontent soul, usually woman who generally doesn't like people and invariably likes terrifying them. You my add hundreds of screeching musical instruments and minutes after minutes of prolonged pauses to supposedly build the suspense. And boo! Gotchya!How many times of the same thing can you take in one film without losing patience, though? That too without any connection with any of the characters whatsoever. Your only involvement with them seems to be out of humanity. No one should have to spend a night fearing for their life. The actors do a decent job, but there is barely any distinguishing characteristic, except that initially a few of them are more afraid than others. So, there is hardly any scope to deviate from a scared expression - across actors. That the ghost's motivations are practically non-existent, could've been used so much more terrifyingly, but here the way it is played out completely kills it. The only thing going for Horror Story is then that despite all things mind-numbingly lame about the film, it does manage to create a decent atmosphere of claustrophobia through the film. That triggers a shiver a couple of times. Unfortunately, that's about it. 90 minutes of being locked in a theater to watch 7 people locked in a haunted hotel. I know, I have the liberty of walking out of the theater. But, some of us just cannot walk out on a movie. That's our make. And we have to bear the burden of our personalities.

The film tells us the story of Melanie, a human whose body is now host to an alien soul; that, by the way, is the modus operandi of these aliens. Except that the feisty Melanie is one of the rare humans who is able to fight the alien - an inner battle that occurs between two souls in one body. The reason for this? Didn’t I mention something about puke earlier?One of the fundamental flaws in the film, one that anyone with even a quarter of a squid’s brain will wonder about, is why exactly we have a problem with these aliens. They are largely peace-loving, and an opening voiceover tells us that these aliens have actually done planet Earth a world of good; there is no violence at all, and the Earth is more beautiful than ever before. In fact, the film is actually a celebration of the glorious faults of humankind. We are greedy, violent beings, who often succumb to carnal calls, who will invariably break the rules and who won’t think twice about putting loads of other human lives in danger, if it benefits us individually in some way. The ‘aliens’ are the exact opposite, not to mention the fact that they are far more technically advanced than us. Yet, somehow, the film tries to sell us the fact that humans deserve to rule the earth far more than these aliens do.That apart, the romance aspect of the film is so inane, so absolutely silly, that all you want is for everyone in love in the film to die; a gruesome death. Unfortunately for us, that doesn’t seem to be the way Stephenie Meyer operates. I must confess, I’ve never watched or read anything of the Twilight series. And considering how it is a standing joke in pop culture, I’ve always wondered just how bad is Twilight any way. Well, if Twilight is even half as silly as The Host, I’m glad I stayed away from it.What’s surprising is Andrew Niccol’s decision to direct this film. I’ve liked a number of his previous films, not just the ones he’s directed, but the ones he’s written as well. The former include cult hit Lord of War, the cerebral Gattaca, and even that guilty indulgence In Time, while the latter include films like The Terminal and The Truman Show, amongst others. He’s always seemed to have a fondness for films set in the future, and he’s almost always managed to make them reasonably convincing. The Host, however, is an unmitigated disaster. It doesn’t help at all that not one of the characters and faces in the film appeal to you in any way. The way the characters have been written, and the performances of the cast - both are mostly bland. Only William Hurt and Diane Kruger from the supporting cast make any impact. Saoirse Ronan, who plays Melanie and who has to virtually anchor the film throughout, tries her best, but really comes up quite short.Even for a sci-fi film, The Host is filled with so many logical inconsistencies and screenplay problems that you’re all but waiting for the film to just get over as soon as possible, perhaps so that you can flush away the experience of the film at the earliest. In fact, if there really existed an alien race like the one in the film and if they ever saw The Host, they’d probably break their own non-violent ethics and shoot themselves in the head.

411,509,509,509,509,Hotel Transylvania,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/hotel-transylvania-review/,,,,3.233333333,"A goofy, easy-enough watch for adults and children alike, Hotel Transylvania doesn’t, by any stretch of imagination, make for a memorable film. It makes for a fair watch on television, perhaps, but not much more.","It has been a while since audiences were treated to a truly great animation film; in no way does Hotel Transylvania change that fact. Meant as a thrilling, comic take on Count Dracula and other famous ‘monsters’ from pop-culture, Hotel Transylvania, directed by Genndy Tartakovsky, doesn’t offer nearly as many laughs as one would have liked, nor does it manage to particularly thrill the audience much. Still, it makes for a fair watch, provided you are familiar enough with the quirks of some of our eternal ‘other-worldly’ characters.Count Dracula adores his daughter, Mavis, beyond belief. To protect her from the grotesqueness of mankind, he builds a secluded but lavish hotel, far from prying human eyes, where she can grow up; a safe haven for her as well others of his ilk. Unfortunately of course, Mavis is at the age where her curiosity has now been piqued – she wants to encounter humans. Meanwhile young Jonathan, a simple, lovable human not beyond the odd acts of buffoonery, inadvertently stumbles upon the castle now housing a host of creatures of the night. Tartakovsky, not a stranger to exploring idiosyncracies of outlandish, accented characters, doesn’t seem to have made much progress from his Dexter’s Lab days. There are some genuine smile-inducing as well as laugh-out-loud moments in the film; I don’t normally laugh during even the funniest of films, but I did a couple of times in this one. Still, the genuinely funny moments are too few in number because most of them are just too predictable. I mean, how many people still find garlic jokes on a vampire funny?The film does flirt with a very important theme – that of ‘them’ and ‘us’. The manner in which monsters fear humans, attributing them with terrible traits and alarming accessories meant to persecute and torture monsters, does make you stop for a second and wonder just how these mythical monsters emerged from the recesses of human thought. And if they do really exist, isn’t it quite likely that they would be as terrified of us as we are of them? After all, and this is no secret, humans are easily the most terrible creatures in all of existence. This segregation of monsters and human beings also draws parallels between how humans, divided even between ourselves, have serious misconceptions about the ‘other’. Not that one gets to dwell much on these thoughts in the midst of the on-screen shenanigans. Adam Sandler, who voices Dracula, is easily the pick of the cast. He gets the best lines and is also the most appealing character in terms of story as well as the animation. Andy Samberg and Selena Gomez as Jonathan and Mavis respectively, are extremely endearing as well, as are the other side character voices. The overall animation isn’t particularly impressive, while the 3D is hardly inspiring. It seemed like the only real purpose it served is for the audience to watch and enjoy the 3D trailer of ‘Oz: The Great and Powerful’. The film itself seemed largely two-dimensional in its visuals; it would possibly have had a far more vibrant feel without the dark glasses. While Hotel Transylvania could possibly make for a fun outing for children, I’m not sure if today’s kids are particularly aware of the characters in the film – Dracula, Frankenstein and the likes - to be taken in by all the ribbing and tomfoolery at their expense. Or maybe I’m just not giving them enough credit. The film could make for a fun watch if there were enough people in the know, for company. Otherwise, it makes for an indifferent animation film experience.

412,510,510,510,510,[The] Hours,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/the-hours-review/,,,,3.233333333,"I urge you to try and read Mrs. Dalloway before you watch The Hours. More than the novel of the same name (of which the movie is quite the direct adaptation), Mrs Dalloway gives you an in-depth insight into Woolf’s style of writing and the intricacies of the character of Clarissa Dalloway – on whom the three characters in the film are based. The Hours celebrates complexity and inquiry. It can leave you gloomy and brimming with existential questions. Be warned, but don’t miss the film – it’s an experience I highly recommend. ","In 1941, Sussex, England, celebrated feminist author Virginia Woolf puts rocks in her pockets and drowns herself in a river. Of the many floating speculations, the largely accepted reason for this suicide was Woolf’s much talked about paranoia. Her style and her works have been widely adapted and made into theatrical plays and feature films – yet, only one such film manages to capture the exact concoction of feminism, fiction and bizarre eccentricity that was Virginia Woolf – The Hours. The movie, based on the novel of the same name by Michael Cunningham, is based on three women who are connected by the segregated souls of a character from Woolf’s novel Mrs. Dalloway – Clarissa Dalloway. The film is also divided into three time zones. In 2002, there is Clarissa Vaughan (played by Meryl Streep), a New Yorker who prepares a party for her AIDS-stricken friend Richard (Ed Harris). In 1950s Los Angeles there is Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) who is pregnant and vastly dissatisfied in her marriage. Then there is Woolf herself (played by Nichole Kidman), in the 1920s in England, and we see her struggling with her depression and mental paranoia.All three characters are connected – like three lost souls swimming in a fish bowl. They are different aspects of the one character in Woolf’s novel. Clarissa Dalloway is an over-analytical, submissive, bi-curious, complex woman and these aspects have been stripped into three vital characters. Moore, Streep and Kidman adapt to their cultural and social time zones perfectly and yet stay true to their complexity, because The Hours is a complex film. It’s a film that delves deep into the psyche of these these characters and their battle with their complicated selves. Parallel narratives guide the film, while we get a strong whiff of every character’s thought processes and questions. It’s a technique that Woolf was famous for – stream of consciousness – the ability to write freely as the character thinks. Director Stephen Daldry adapts this technique well, as you feel you are visually entering the minds of these three women, carefully observing their every thought and every dilapidated query. The Hours is essentially a celebration of complexity of thought. You may not be going in any direction, plot-wise, with the film. You will just find yourself walking around in circles, dissecting every thought-bubble that the film tries to present to you. The most important thing that The Hours does is make you question. The kind of spooky questioning that lets you lie in bed, stare at the ceiling and just think – What is acceptable behavior and what is not? The existential question that rides all our backs – what is life about? What am I doing with mine? More than that, the film offers you three different approaches to sexuality, suicide, depression and three different versions of the same women who have those approaches.The DVD of The Hours has some interesting features: An audio commentary by Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Nicole Kidman and 4 Featurettes: Three Women, The Mind and Times of Virginia Woolf, The Music of The Hours, The Lives of Mrs. Dalloway. All four featurrettes are small and explanatory. It provides as a great post-movie viewing as it puts a lot of things into perspective if you haven’t read Mrs Dalloway or The Hours.What makes The Hours a must watch, over the novel, are the performances. Kidman is absolutely engrossing, as Virgina Woolf (you might not even recognize her with her nose being drastically tampered with), playing the desolate, complex part. I would go ahead and say she is the best performer in the film, even ahead of Streep, who looks like she got up from her sleep to play this part. Streepis effortless and extremely likeable – a concrete emotion that Clarissa Dalloway doesn’t draw. Julianne Moore looks her demure and confused part. Watch The Hours most certainly not for entertainment, but for the deep and difficult questioning of those very human emotions we take for granted.

We are just a bunch of 'mango' people who are happy to be in a theater after a long hiatus. So happy are we that there is at least something to watch, to draw us to the halls, that we don't mind the ""open head; keep brain aside in safety; close head; watch film"" drill. Yeah-yeah-yeah the comedy is not bad, or let's just say it's better than what one would expect from this team. And it’s the sight of an oasis in a desert. And thirsty we were.","8.30 AM. 600-seater theater. Housefull. Ok-ok almost housefull, but it was mandatory to use the name, right? So, now that we are done with that, let me tell you, I'm not kidding. The theater had barely 10-15 vacant seats. And the other 585-590 seats were laughing/hooting/whistling/clapping - basically being happy they are in a theater and there is something half-half-decent on the screen.Of course, there was this one person who was just thoroughly relishing the fact that people around her were completely involved in the chaos and enjoying the experience to the hilt - yours truly. I'm not saying I didn't like the film at all, but I couldn't call the film engrossing or 100% entertaining. It was just about alright. I laughed really hard a few times. But, not as much on a mind-blowing, insides-rattling joke as I did due to the silliness of it all. I mean what else can you laugh at when people suffer an electronic shock and that, moves on to become a dance. The nutty absurdity is not restricted to one-off incidents. While the first half introduces characters and builds relationships, the second half is spent in rewiring all the connections. Whose wife is whose sister is whose daughter is whose wife…or something like that. Yeah, such comedy of errors and mistaken identities have potential for loads of laughs. Housefull is neither devoid of them, nor…well, full of them. Of course, it's the standard loud, is almost a tolerable variety of over-the-top and it defies logic at every chance it's given. Out-of-job characters or characters with presumably low-paying jobs spend money like they are Midas. Other characters who are supposedly rich, make you wonder how such low-IQ people could get so far. Oops, look at me getting caught up in trivialities. The idea is to have fun, and well it is not a complete loss on that count. Had the performances been a little more subtle and a little more consistent, it could have easily been a fun ride through the run time. But, as usual, while the dialogues are on a consistent roll, the events are rather sporadic. Similarly, while the comic timing of most of the actors is brilliant, the individual scenes are not necessarily strong enough. The three men do their usual thing. National award winner Arjun Rampal, in his bit role, looks very uncomfortable trying his shot at comedy. The women on the other hand look good, alternate between shrieking and sort-of superficially expressing a sad/romantic emotion. I love the way Deepika Padukone carries herself in the skimpiest of clothes. Yep! There's loads and loads of that. And those who are going there for Jiah Khan, well, bother not. She barely has a cameo. I know it's been a famine of big-profile releases. I know you want to rush to the theater given the slightest excuse. But though it has those mindless, silly laughs, I don't have the heart to recommend that you spend money and time on what it takes for a family to go to the theaters. Time spent on it when it's out on TV/DVD though might be well worth it.

I was a tiny bit surprised with the momentum maintained in the chaos. But an 'aah...interesting' kind of a surprise doesn't necessarily make it a fun experience.","It's difficult to call the makers of Housefull 2 mindless or unintelligent. There's no way someone can make something so silly and not know it. It requires a high level of awareness to write and make a film so profoundly senseless. And from the manner in which the entire audience was laughing it looks like they have done their homework on what the 'first day first show' audience enjoys. Of course, none of this newfound admiration converts me into that part of the audience that enjoys such humor.Given how little typical slapstick makes me laugh, it was almost a miracle that I laughed hard at a couple of the 'repeat phrase/expression' assigned to a couple of characters. And of course, they had to go ahead and spoil it by repeating it, for what feels like, a few hundred times! And that's the problem with films like these. They don't know where to stop, neither with their specific jokes nor the film itself. It's high time, we make it mandatory for writers to spend a year just on the climax. The utter tomfoolery in the last 20-30 minutes makes you want to bang your head on a wall harder than you were doing thus far. What with one of the worst opening sequences ever. Yet, a part of me is in awe of the writer's capacity to keep the utter chaos amongst twelve lead characters at a peak through most of the film. Of course again, I didn't enjoy the chaos but I certainly couldn't stop admiring how the writers seemed to have the story straight in their head amidst absolute commotion. The writing also attempts at a wide range of tools to create humor - from puns to rhymes to toilet humor to sexual jokes to sarcasm to 'pet phrases/expressions' to mimicry to what-say-you. Some work, most don't. Almost all repeat. Also, for a change I enjoyed Akshay Kumar and John Abraham's comic timing. Before it became repetitive. Amongst the women Asin gets a teeny-weeny bit to display her ability to make people laugh. While Riteish Deshmukh and Shreyas Talpade have as banal and inconsequential roles as the rest of the women, they at least are not insulted for being the gender they belong to. Please appreciate the amount of control I've maintained in not going all out and on and on about how ridiculously stupid ALL the women in the film are. Also, the lesser I say about the veterans  the quicker I'll be able to forget how insulted I felt by watching them in such menial roles. Housefull 2 is one of those rare films where I looked forward to the song breaks - nice, colorful, well-dressed good-looking people. That just about describes Housefull 2 in its entirety except that the film has some not-so-good-looking people too. Housefull 2 made me want to experience what it is the writers were having when they wrote it. Worry not, just as an experiment, one should know what it feels like, no?

","Someone I know read out a forwarded joke with full enthusiasm, “Listen to this one, it is hilarious! Why do chickens sit on eggs? Because they don't have chairs.”  I am stumped trying to figure out why this is funny. “How do they even think of this stuff!? Hats off to their brains!”, she goes on. I refrain from trying to point out that chickens don't sit on eggs. That is exactly the kind of humor Housefull 3 carries. It doesn't make you laugh much but you are dumbstruck thinking about the process which might have brought out the joke – the overall plot, the situations, the puns, the slapstick, everything. That awe takes the edge off the torture but there is enough in the form of regressive concepts, racism, sexism and other forms of insensitivity that you would rather avoid.The two main types of humor that Housefull 3 banks on are the forwarded variety or the kind that are with the intention of being insensitive. There is a third type in the form of performances, but of the lot only Akshay Kumar puts in all his energy. While it still didn't make me laugh, he was doing a lot more than just contorting his face. Of course, he was the only one who had a character with scope for doing more. Abhishek Bachchan and Riteish Deshmukh don't really have much to make their characters look or feel different from each other. Boman Irani too is the typical loud character you would find in every slapstick.Similarly, the ladies Jacqueline Fernandez, Lisa Haydon and Nargis Fakhri play the regular props who are supposed to make us differentiate between cultured and uncultured women by their attire. Oh well.Actually I got one good laugh. It was a real hoot to see how self-aware the film-makers are. They actually included a scene that confesses and apologizes for all that is wrong about the film. It is always funny when people know that what they are doing is wrong and go ahead and do it anyway.As far as the story goes, it is hard to say whether there was some method to the silliness or we have gotten used to it so much that it seems like the new normal.

The animation is breathtaking (Dreamworks is pushing the envelope with every film), the action sequences are spectacular, as are the scenes where Hiccup takes flight with his dragon Toothless. One of those DVDs, which is a safe bet when friends come over and you don’t mind watching it again and again.","With a title like How To Train Your Dragon, one can almost guess what the film has in store. Human meets animal. Friction and resistance. Human tames animal. They become friends and so on.Thankfully, the writers of this film have done a lot more to Cressida Cowell's novel by the same name, which is the original inspiration for this film. What's helped them is the faith, money and outstanding talent at Dreamworks, who’ve mounted this film on a scale that lends itself to not just spectacular 3D action, but also an immense feel good high, once it’s over. I say this because the story, could have easily been done in live action, but wouldn’t have been half as spectacular, nor convincing. The unfolding screenplay doesn't take too long to establish the storyline and the writers do just about enough to maintain the excitement throughout the film's duration. Starting with the action packed opening sequence filled with fireballs and slaughter of a host of dragons, there are spectacular flying sequences with Hiccup mounted on top of the Toothless (the dragon) and Astrid, his love interest. As a viewer, you know when you're watching them on screen flying in the clouds, how magnificent the film would have looked on the big screen, but since it’s on DVD, I suggest the bigger your screen, the better. HTTYD's real merit lies in being a wholesome entertainer, despite tracing a predictable storyline. About 30 minutes into the film, and you instantly know how the story is going to shape out - the simpleton of the village will emerge a hero by the end of this film. So here's why the film works. I've always believed that audiences have certain hotpoints in their senses that a film must touch upon, if it has to please. Goosebumps, feel good proceedings, elements that make you go “WOW” and “Woohoo!” – these are just some emotions and reactions to make a good, compelling film. Fortunately, HTTYD has all of that. And since it’s on DVD, the bonus features, which include the making of the film and the director's commentary do more than enough to validate your liking for this film. Typically, your admiration for an animation film always increases once you've seen the efforts that went into its making. HTTYD is no exception. So, although Gerard Butler, the voice of Stoik, the village chief, doesn't get the meatiest role in the film, it is fun watching him behind the microphone. Ditto for the supporting cast, producers and team of animators, who bring their own stories. For example, you'll learn that one of the most breathtaking shots in the film (when the frame does a complete U-turn in the sky), was cinematographer Gil Zimmerman's idea. John Powell's music has an enormous uplifting feel to it, so crucial for feel good, coming of age stories. And it was rather astonishing to learn that the animators actually went to a flying school to master the techniques of how birds and dragons would have taken flight. What’s more, the creative team also ensured that since it’s about dragons, there must be all kinds of them. And since they breathe fire, there is also a variety in the kinds of fire they spew. Possibly, that's just one of the reasons why it’s a great idea to own it on DVD. Because you learn to appreciate the enormity of effort that actually went behind making every little scene, every sequence. HTTYD is one of the top contender's at the Oscars and Golden Globes next year. I think it stands a fair chance, considering it’s a breath of fresh air, outside of the typical animation film clichés that we've come to know of - world of ants, monsters, fish, robots. Although, it doesn't make any powerful statement like Wall-E did, or evoke similar emotions to last year's winner Up, I think it still does enough to stand tall and be proud of itself in a highly competitive category. I'm sure that on your DVD shelf, it will behave similarly.

Hridaynath, directed by Amar Gupte, falls smack in the middle of that category. Despite an earnest effort by Jackie Shroff, the film’s poor story and screenplay can throw intolerant audience members into a tizzy. Watch it only if you absolutely loved Ek Tha Tiger (perhaps not even then.)","With a title like ""Hridaynath"" (‘Ruler of the Heart’, apparently) and with the kind of poster this film had, the expectations one would have had while walking in to watch the film would have been fairly obvious. The first few minutes of the film would have cemented those expectations. A soliloquy by the film's lead actor, Jackie Shroff, against the backdrop of a sunset along the Konkan coast, talking about the disconnect between matters of the heart and mind; the touching, if tad dramatic, revelation that he is a schoolteacher in a village who is about to retire after 40 years of selfless service to generations of students; things were indeed set up nicely for a sensitive story about a middle aged man on the cusp of a new phase of his life. Alas, not only does the film go downhill faster than a professional skier, it is the 'how' of it that will truly boggle the audiences' mind. The tragedy here is that I can't talk about the asinine plot twist at intermission that threw one particularly petulant audience member behind me into a hyperventilating rant about the evils of choosing to watch a film based on its promos.It isn't just the absurdity of the plot that rankles though. The entire setup and resolution are flawed because of the excess in them. One whole half is spent repeatedly hammering the character traits of the protagonist on the audiences’ head, while the other half is spent deconstructing it, in a sense. Also, while considerable and noteworthy effort has clearly gone into making the film look like it has decent production values, the fact remains that the lack of budget shows quite often. If one were to put a gun to my head however, and ask me to point out at least one positive that can be drawn from this film, it would have to be Jackie Shroff. The man is quite clearly having fun, and in spite of his labored Marathi, one can clearly see the hard work that has gone into his dubbing for the film. And which Rangeela fan wouldn't smile at the sight of Jackie Shroff and Urmila Matondkar together on screen, even if the situation is plain ridiculous? If ever there had to be a movie whose plot deserved to be given away, it would undoubtedly be Hridaynath; discussing the film would be infinitely more fun than the film itself. However, since I truly believe in the ideology behind wogma, all I'd like to say is that unless you like Parinda as much as I do and have grown up in awe of Jackie Shroff's swagger in films like Tridev, Hridaynath can very safely be avoided without an iota of doubt.

418,516,516,516,516,Hugo,Owner's Pride!,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/hugo-review/,,4/5.0,,3.033333333,"It had to be a film that is as diametrically opposite to, say, Taxi Driver or Goodfellas, to show the world just what cinema means to Martin Scorsese. This love letter to the movies from one of the legends of our time is nothing short of a wondrous watch on the big screen. If the recreation of some of the most iconic moments in the history of cinema is not good enough for you, then the visually thrilling 3D experience definitely will be. Only one thing needs to be said – Please watch Hugo on the big screen.","No matter how much you claim to love the movies, there will always be one man who can rightfully claim to love them more. His name is Martin Scorsese. That Scorsese’s knowledge and understanding of film history, film theory and film grammar is virtually unmatched is a fact well known. So if there was anyone who one could bet on, to understand exactly when and how to use the oft-abused 3D technology to get the best out of it, it would have to be Martin Scorsese. So what does Scorsese do when he uses 3D for the first time ever? He makes a thrillingly visual ode to that which he loves the most – the movies. Hugo is a film that you shouldn’t miss in the theatre even if you don’t like cinema. And if you love the movies the way some of us do, Hugo is an experience that won’t exit your system in a hurry. Based on the book ‘The Invention of Hugo Cabret’ by Brian Selznick, Hugo tells the tale of an orphan who lives within the recesses of a Paris train station - his home amidst the chains and sprockets that run the clock at the train station provides him with an enviable view of the Eiffel Tower looming large over one of the world’s great cities. One of Hugo’s most prized possessions is a mechanical humanoid, something his deceased father found years ago in a forgotten corner of a museum. And Hugo’s aim is to complete his father’s dream of making the mechanical bot work once again. In his quest, he encounters a shopkeeper at the train station, a man whose story is inexorably tied with Hugo’s. Shot lovingly in glorious 3D, Hugo is arguably the first film that beautifully meshes the third dimension with the grammar of cinema to create a compelling theatrical experience. Not to mention the fact that proponents of digital over film will be thrilled with the results that the Arri Alexa has produced. Even the Academy Award for Cinematography doesn’t do justice to just how good Hugo is visually - the breathtaking opening shot alone justifies the use of 3D. The atmosphere that the film creates with the post-World War I Parisian setting is nothing short of incredible. The fact that a large portion of it is multiple Award-winning VFX rarely crosses your mind. Interestingly, not too deep from the surface of the thrill-ride that the story and the characters take you on, lies the characters’ quest for answers to the ultimate existential dilemma - what is one’s purpose? What helps immensely is the fact that the entire cast does complete justice to their parts. With his piercing blue eyes, Asa Butterfield as Hugo will charm you. But it is Ben Kingsley playing the old ‘shopkeeper’ whose performance will leave you with a lump in your throat. Also, Sacha Baron Cohen as the over-enthusiastic Station Master out for Hugo’s throat is plain adorable. But nothing beats the ultimate treat that this film offers – its tribute to cinema. Hugo is the kind of film that will show you just how much you love the movies – the intensity of the shivers up your spine will be directly proportional to how much cinema means to you. This, the most un-Scorsese like picture ever, actually feels much closer to Scorsese’s heart than most of his other jaw-dropping work.The tragedy then is that Hugo has been released in India over four months since it was released abroad. And this afterthought release itself is nothing short of embarrassing – no multiplex has more than a show a day for ‘A Martin Scorsese Picture.’ One can only hope that the audience throngs these limited shows to show corporates how to treat a master’s work.

But it's realistic enough for you to sense your housing society on the big screen.","Noises in his apartment society made Raj Puri (Sushant Singh) a cranky man. This irritability introduced his wife, Abha (Kartikadevi Rane) to a new facet of his personality. The same crabbiness egged the middle-class secretary of the society, Janardhan (Rajat Kapoor), to take more pride in implementing the safety measures causing the crankiness. Repeat. Repeat. And repeat once more. With each round though, the aggravation increased. A piece of anyone's life - the noises replaced by any other irritant that cause tiffs in apartment complexes. But, the repetition made me too lazy to even yawn. Sure, the simplicity of the plot had a Hrishikesh Mukherjee feel to it, and so does the style of narration. But Hulla misses out big time on keeping me engaged. Though, the underlying commentary on the sham that security systems are was amusing, staying attentive throughout was an effort. And I assume it was intended to be a light smile-your-way-through comedy, but these smiles were only occasional. None of which can be blamed on the lead cast. The noises begin annoying you as a viewer despite Raj's clearly unreasonable demands. Thanks to the pained expression Sushant so consistently carries. It's just fascinating to watch the man behind most of the pain, Rajat Kapoor. Watching him as a struggling businessman from a not-so-affluent background was refreshing and it looked like he was enjoying the difference too. The casting of the two is really creative and has worked, because on paper anyone would have been tempted to swap them. Hail versatility!Kartikadevi absolutely comes across as the combination of girl-next-door cum career-minded woman cum home-maker. And 74-year old Chandrachoor Karnik, as the ever-obedient watchman, reminded me of Shaikh chacha, a watchman in our building, who would always nod his head to all instructions. But, the rest of the cast came across as caricatures. They were sketchy representatives of each 'type' of person any apartment complex would have. The writing here surely looked flimsy compared to the lead cast.It is very obvious that this is a fairly low-budget movie from the relatively low-profile cast and the out-of-focus scenes every once in a while. And yet, something different has been tried. Interestingly, though, another ""housing society + stock exchange"" themed movie has released on the same day! Anyway, there is this urge to tell a simple story well. It might not have succeeded completely this time. Come on, how much of another person's boring problem can I be expected to watch? But I'm sure the movie-makers, especially the writers will learn from their follies and meanwhile members of the audience like yours truly will learn to deal with ennui.

Yes, I could go on and on about the songs from Hum Dono. Remember, I haven't even spoken about my other favorites from the film - 'dukh aur sukh ke raaste...' and 'mein zindagi ka saath...'. Who are we kidding? Take away the songs from the film, and Hum Dono would barely be known to our generation. Of course, there are some very strong dialogues too, but they sound way too profound because of their pseudo-preachy tone. A line that stayed with me even though it was rather out-of-context is, ""thukraaya hua pyaar kabhi bujhta nahi, dhuaan udta rehta hai"" (unrequited love never dies, it always comes back to haunt you) will sound only 'blech' in a film made today. And that I think is the power of pure language, no SMS-ese, no  Hinglish. How else could that simile with a burning cigar helpfully letting out smoke on the screen have worked?  Actually, Hum Dono must be on very few ""favorites"" list. It has its share of screeching violins that amplify the already melodramatic moments. And the twists go far beyond believability. Even if you believe there are six faces in the world that are similar to yours and even if you believe Anand (Dev Anand) coincidentally lives in the same city and is a soldier in the same platoon as his look alike Manohar (Dev Anand), what happens in the second half of the story is at best, comical. And despite that, the showdown between each of the women and Dev Anand are moving. You feel for Meeta's (Sadhna) frustration when she feels that her wait for Anand's return has been in vain and Roma (Nanda) touches you with her single-minded devotion to her husband. Again this is because you are travelling back in time. Today in all likelihood, she would be a mere laughing stock. But these films from yore are such a lovely reminder of our innocence. And am I glad I could watch it in all its glory. I love watching films in theaters. Other than the obvious reasons - better picture and sound quality, general ambience, etc - it is the fact that, the film was made to be viewed like that which attracts me to the cinema hall. So, even though oldies like Hum Dono might play on TV, such re-releases are our only chance of catching them on the big screen. While I wouldn't mind seeing the black and white versions. But, if sustaining an almost three-hour film takes a little color in this special-effects age, so be it. The colorization added as much as it took away from the film. Sure, glitches like only one of Sadhna's eyes had make-up on are negligible. But, the inconsistency in camerawork, namely the choppy switch in and out of soft focus became even more glaring with the use of color. On the other hand, the pastel shades make each frame a painting of a jaded-yet-beautiful texture. Almost like it doesn't want you to forget the dated value system it advocates. And if you are one who can watch a film for its paintings and its poetry, make sure you have that special hand to hold with you. For the love of its music and lyrics, I wish I hadn't watched Hum Dono alone.

This would have been fine if the light vein didn’t mix so abruptly but with the overflow of sentiments. Ultimately we are left with a dissatisfactory resolution which seems unintentional.,"There’s a lot of confusion - in the story and in the execution. As is true of many stories that deal with paranormal and mental health, Hum Tum Aur Ghost too, shuttles between the two. Some take sides, some argue it out like a drawing room conversation. Here they don’t do either very intentionally. Which is refreshing but in turn they don’t get the audience involved in the story either. Unfortunately this is despite trying really hard. Really hard to create sweet moments between Arman and Gehna (Arshad Warsi and Dia Mirza) and friendships between Arman and Mini (Sandhya Mridul) or Arman and Mr. Kapoor (Boman Irani) ; really hard to create comic drama around the mystery surrounding Arman’s “condition”; really hard to make the subject and story interesting. I felt like a pendulum that sways from subtle comedy to serious drama. And the shifts are pretty abrupt. As abrupt as some of the scenes are stuck together – literally looks like the film was randomly chopped and glued together. It was extremely disorienting. The entire cast looks like they have made a good-faith attempt at getting into character. You see romance and sweet nothings being exchanged. They should have brought that “aawwww” moments, but no such luck. The emotions look way to superficial. The saving grace though is that some of the comic lines are as subtly slid in as they are funny - very. But they are also very few and quite far between. And the sudden tone shift between funny and display of emotions doesn’t help either. Ultimately, the entire film feels like one big trial, a rehearsal for a mediocre show. The confusion in the minds of the makers is way too transparent. Maybe the only situation in which I’d say, I don’t want the thoughts of the writer/director to show through to me.

","Comparisons with DDLJ and JWM are inevitable. Not that the makers have any qualms about having that comparison made. If only, HSKD had the warmth of DDLJ or the spark of  JWM. Yet, there is some attempt at being different and that's applaudable. Now, HSKD modernises DDLJ with today's lingo and it wouldn't be too far-fetched to say that the average Simran has now grown up to become the average Kavya. To that extent Alia Bhatt's Kavya works. Her adorable demeanor is very difficult to get over and I can imagine people going to the theaters just to watch her and coming out happy.But, she has barely anything to do post-interval. A lot of Aalia's missing over-powering screen presence has to do with Kavya's boyfriend (Humpty, Varun Dhawan) and father (Singh, Ashutosh Rana) taking over the reins of what she wants from life. This is where the film begins to get annoying. This lady, who goes from small-town Ambala to Delhi to organize a Rs. 5,00,000 designer wedding dress, but is willing to do nothing for herself when it matters to her the most? Instead, she's expecting the world to revolve around her despite all else. I understand the film wants to keep things light and I'm thankful they don't go all siren-y melodramatic on us. But, you cannot connect/sympathize with a lead lady just because she's the lead lady, right? What hope is left if she's either full of herself or all chirpy-bubbly when times are desperate. But, Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania scores full points in the one huge complaint I have against films like DDLJ and JWM - the other guy. Unlike its predecessors, HSKD's other guy is not a loser, and is as good as the hero. For all practical purposes, he's well-worth the lead lady (since she's made out to be the prize money). So, there is only one reason to root for our hero. Of course, Humpty is written out to be someone you cannot dislike. But can you root for him? I wasn't too stumped by him. He does all the right things, alright. But, somehow it all seems a little too contrived. Which is why the chemistry between Alia Bhatt and him is less chemistry and more mechanics. I don't think we can find fault with Varun Dhawan's performance. Only thing is, the script just doesn't require much emoting out of him. Siddharth Shukla plays the good boy well. Once again, not much is demanded off him. Ashutosh Rana though is the most charming of the lot. Not as menacing as an Amrish Puri, maybe, but someone you can never be too sure off.The characters' motivations are all over the place and transition from one end to the other without much explanation. Almost as if the writers are banking on the audience's forgiving nature, ""itna toh chalta hai"" (This much ""taking us for granted"" is acceptable). Not much of the other stuff worked - except for one song, the music is bhangra or disco and sounds and looks like the next bhangra or disco number. HSKD is cute. It is certainly DDLJ catching up with today's times. So, it sheds itself of much dramatization and a good part of the run-time.

That is a no-brainer. To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised as I saw some semblance of a story in the first hour. It made way too much sense (even if in a slapsticky kind of way) for a film that was made by the same person who made Housefull 2. It is insensitive at multiple levels, yet it is borderline ""not as bad as I thought"". And then of course, it goes into one bad sub-plot after another till you are sick and tired of it all. Why did Saif Ali Khan do this one? Is the money that good? Or for that matter Bipasha Basu. Her role is so tiny and most of the time that she's on screen she is relegated to second lead lady. Ram Kapoor is the best of the lot, but that's barely a compliment. Sure, Saif Ali Khan and Riteish Deshmukh do try to contort their faces in ways which made the theater laugh, but that seemed like child's play. Anyway, a change of genre for Riteish Deshmukh is long overdue, I'll hold off comment till Ek Villain. In this one though he does his usual stuff. When the lines are unengaging there is only so much you can do. Interestingly, you'd have thought that the film would rely heavily on one-liners and punch lines to get a laugh out of its audiences. But instead, the ""comedy"" came from the situations rather than a dialogue here or there. I must confess here, that this is my judgment from the way the viewers were reacting rather than my own response. My gut wrenched as the insults got heavier and heavier. I'm not talking about the assault on my intellect. But, about the insensitivity shown towards patients of mental asylums; towards gay people; towards obese people; towards midgets; towards men who dress like women and so on. What is it about these things that makes us laugh? Why is it funny? A mental hospital warden (not even a doctor!) dancing with electrical wires while giving an electrical shock to his patients! Really? That's not humor, that's sad. I understand, that not every thing needs to turn into an outrage and we should know how to laugh at ourselves and so on. And to complete the circle, Sajid Khan cracks a joke at his own film too. But I am not comfortable with poking fun at people's disabilities and/or appearances. Even watching it is not done. I guess I should only be thankful that the film keeps sexual and toilet humor under control. Though there are long scenes involving each one of them which made me cringe. I am not really expecting to enjoy a Sajid Khan film any time soon. But, is a little sensitivity too much to ask for from a filmmaker who has a reasonably wide reach? Does humor have to be at someone else's expense?

426,524,524,524,524,[The] Hunger Games,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review2 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/hunger-games-review/,,3/5.0,,2.35,"Watch The Hunger Games – not just so it can blow your mind away with its un-thinkable premise (for which the book takes credit) but mostly for its representation of a Futuristic America, its ability to hold a mirror to our urban practices to make us question our existence as it stands. ","The best thing about a science fiction/fantasy film is not in its ability to make us imagine. It’s the ability that a film has to represent what we consider “human” or “normal” in a deliriously make-believe manner. The Hunger Games stumps you with its basic idea, but once you move beyond its premise, it manages to captivate you with the manner in which the message is told. For its ability to push you to fantasize beyond your regular boundaries of imagination, The Hunger Games is two and a half hours of intellectually-fuelled fantasy that you deserve. The Hunger Games has an extremely disturbing premise. Set in the futuristic city of Panem in America, based on the sci-fi novel of the same name written by Suzanne Collins, the movie revolves around the Annual Hunger Games. The Capitol city conducts The Hunger Games every year, to remind the 12 districts constituting Panem, of their authority and power.  24 teenagers or “tributes” as they are called are pitted against each other in the jungles in a survival-of-the-fittest type reality show, and only one emerges winner. As they battle it out, blood-wars and deceptions included, the people of the Capitol city celebrate it as a sporting event. 
The point is well made in your head by then, as an audience. You are indirectly told that a harsh remark is being made at the idea of urbanization. By the time the 24 teens enter the jungles you are well acquainted with the bizarre practices of the Capitol city. 
The film up till this point holds your attention, allows you to enter a world that is magnificently mocking and makes you sit-up and draw comparisons between Capitol City and planet Earth. But the moment the 24 kids enter the jungles, each adventure then becomes a tad bit predictable. A predictability that works but because it has such a meticulously-stimulating first half, it’s almost as if you’re transported into a different film. 
The two lead “tributes” Katniss Evergreen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are shown to be in love, because the Capitol authorities believe the audiences want something to hope for – they soon have a romance angle that is staged for the purpose of entertainment. It makes you want to feel ashamed of being a part of a generation that celebrates facades, and staged realities. The action in the jungle sequence has a few endearing moments too. – with relationships brewing between participants, in a situation of absolute rivalry. 
Oscar-nomited Jennifer Lawrence (As Katniss) brings the desired poker-faced burdened performance to her character – you immediately empathize with her, and hence agree with every move she makes during the games. In that sense, it’s important that the film’s protagonist makes that connection with its audience, which Lawrence manages well. 
As a film set in a post-apocalyptic future, The Hunger Games makes for a visual delight. With gritty, high intensity shots of the jungles that serve as a stark opposite to the urban “jungle” of the Capitol, the picture leaves you spell-bound. 
The Hunger Games is captivating in that it allows us to place a mirror at our own “evolved” practices. The representation of the people of the Capitol is remarkably innovative and even though a little loud you don’t question the colored mustaches, the golden eye make-up – as they all serve as facades that we, as urban, bureaucratic puppets, often wear. The Hunger Games then is a well-thought, ingenious film with a promise of a sequel that I am waiting for with bated breath.

427,525,525,525,525,[The] Hunger Games: Catching Fire,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review2 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/hunger-games-catching-fire-review/,,5/5.0,,3.35,"Taking things further from The Hunger Games and nicely setting things up for the remainder of the series, Catching Fire is a neat adventure film that holds its own. Jennifer Lawrence is a treat to watch, and her Katniss Everdeen is a character worth rooting for.","What a hero Katniss Everdeen is! She's bold, fearless, righteous and talented; she's also rash, impulsive and unsure. A heady cocktail of grey and white, she's the kind of hero our cinema has sorely lacked. She also reminds us of what a pity it is that we've had so few genuine female heroes in the fiction of our times. Yes, the situations around her often seem conveniently conducive for her heroism to thrive. And yet, one can't help rooting for her, because she's that rare protagonist whose conflicts often mirror our own. Mostly though, it is the sight of her relishing a challenge that truly makes her a delight.Catching Fire takes off from 2012's The Hunger Games, based on the continuing novel by Suzanne Collins. After the 74th Hunger Games that saw Katniss and Peeta emerge as joint winners at the end of the previous film, the pair are now celebrities in all of Panem. President Snow, however, also notices that young Katniss - monickered 'The Girl on Fire' - is also beginning to become a symbol of rebellion against The Capitol; a spark that must be quelled before it becomes a raging fire.With a change of guard at the helm - Francis Lawrence takes over as director for the remainder of the series - Catching Fire seems grittier than the first film. Life in Panem seems more grim, and consequently, the need for a rebellion seems stronger than ever. Simultaneously, the conflict in Katniss's personal life seems to go hand in hand with the unrest in Panem. She doesn't want the two to intersect, and yet, life has placed her at a juncture where the two are nearly one and the same. She's the beacon of hope that the oppressed need to rally around, when all she wants is to be away from it all, with her family and love.Around all of this, the lavish, obnoxious decadence of those in power, and the gloomy existence of those without it, is brought into sharp contrast - at times a little stronger than is completely necessary. The alternating orgy of colour and dull blue-grey monochrome does have its intended effect, despite its obviousness.  The film turns particularly thrilling in its final act - the 75th Hunger Games - which truly takes what we saw in the previous film to a new level; absolute mayhem that keeps you on the edge. Even if, like in the previous film, a lot happens that makes things conveniently easy for Katniss and Peeta. This was one of the problems I had with the first film as well, but it unfortunately seems the kind of liberty the writers and director don't seem to want to take stock of.Catching Fire also has a soundtrack that builds mood and tension throughout the film, all the way till the end credits, which have a few nice tracks that play all along till the end of the roll.Expectedly, Jennifer Lawrence aces it once again as Katniss Everdeen. Fresh from all of the media attention, adulation and that Academy Award for her flakier-than-snow Tiffany in Silver Linings Playbook, the spunky actress just dons Katniss like she and the character were never apart all this while. Josh Hutcherson, meanwhile, has grown well into the character of Peeta, seeming far more confident this time. The supporting cast - Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson and Donald Sutherland in particular - manage to make their respective characters and their strong traits stand out. The excellent Phillip Seymour Hoffman joins the cast of the film, and what a presence he is. His character is one of the most intriguing in the series now, and is likely to play an important role ahead.But mostly, Catching Fire works because it does what an intermediate film in a series must do - it takes things up a notch from the first film, and it sets things up nicely for the next one. And it does so while also being a sharp, emotional and thrilling film all by itself. This, really, is how you light a spark.

428,526,526,526,526,[The] Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 0/5.0,/movie/hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-review/,,0/5.0,,1.7,"The third and penultimate film of the Hunger Games franchise is the weakest film so far in terms of story and graph, though we get a deeper insight into Katniss Everdeen. Jennifer Lawrence is, expectedly, the best thing about the film yet again.","Most of us have probably heard the story of the man who, many, many years back, was thrown out of a train compartment that he had a rightful ticket to. The man went on to become a rallying point for an entire nation that wished to free itself from colonial rule. If you pause to think, you do wonder whether India would've attained independence if Mohandas Gandhi had been less affronted by the apartheid and racism he faced.The Hunger Games series and its heroine, Katniss Everdeen, are much the same, really. Katniss never wanted to rebel against the oppressive regime that Panem was under. All she wanted to do was protect her sister. Yet, that one little act thrust her into the spotlight, as, by the end of the second film, she became the symbol of rebellion against the Capitol. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 begins almost exactly where Catching Fire left off. Katniss, if you remember, inadvertently disarmed the force field enveloping the arena holding the Games. She was then air-lifted by a group of rebels, much to her chagrin. If you don't have the first clue what I'm talking about, then this film isn't for you anyway, because it makes little attempt to refresh memories. The whole film has been treated with the assumption that the audience is familiar with the first two films (and why not?)More than the first two films, it is this third film in the four-part movie series that really provides an insight into what kind of a person Katniss Everdeen is. It also once again reinforces the sheer talent that Jennifer Lawrence is. One almost feels that if J Law were to face the same situations in real life that Katniss feels in the film, she'd probably react the exact same way. I keep coming back to the word that I always like to use for both the actor and her character - 'spunky'. Righteous, but never self-righteous; shaky but never nervous; angry, but almost never out of control; Katniss is a heroine you'll love more, the more you watch her.Apart from her, though (and the presence of one Phillip Seymour Hoffman), there's little in the film that makes it a must-watch all by itself. It is unavoidable if you're watching the franchise, but it also really conveys very little new, apart from what we figured at the end of Catching Fire - that a revolution is brewing, and Katniss is the Mockingjay - the symbol of this revolution.What's most disappointing about Mockingjay Part 1 is that there is very little action in the film; in fact, there isn't a single large action set piece, just a few isolated little scenes. Yet, what it lacks in action and thrills, it tries to make up for with little things, like an interesting sub-plot about Katniss being filmed for propaganda purposes, with a Leni Riefenstahl-ish female director to boot. Still, nothing can quite make up for the disappointment of not getting to see Everdeen display too much of her archery skills - one of the highlights of the earlier films.Director Francis Lawrence handles the film like a mixed bag. He seems to have a grip over the emotional graph he wants to follow, but the arc of the film itself actually does so little for the overall story, that you sometimes wonder if the novel Mockingjay could have just been made into one film, to neatly wrap the series up as a trilogy. The first two films saw Katniss make giant leaps as she revealed her nerves of steel, her unabashed virtuousness and fierce talent. This one, well, it just seems like a place holder. Hopefully, all the fireworks, excitement and thrill have been left for the final film, which will take us to the conclusion of Katniss Everdeen and Panem's fight for freedom - the kind of fight we're subconsciously so familiar with, but which will always resonate if done well. But for that, Mockingjay Part 2 will have to go many, many notches above Part 1.

The rest is a regular coming-of-age cum love story masked under the garb of a sex comedy. Neither very funny, nor insightful. ","Hunterrr's sex comedy bit is just the garnishing. To make the dish look palatable and draw you into the theater. No wonder you don't see much more than what you've already seen in the trailers. So, those of us going in to see our sexual needs represented in a comic way will be disappointed because that bit you've already seen in the promos. Those of us going in for the story of a boy who grew up like us or the romance will see nothing new because you've seen it in some other film.And I have an inkling the writers were very aware of this. Only that can explain the back and forth in timelines. Usually, non-linearity is very intriguing and works brilliantly in building up to the climax. But, in Hunterrr after a point, I stopped caring. It didn't matter when Mandar dated which woman. Woman after woman till present day. He shows no disrespect to any woman but has his priorities right – and understandably so. It is ok for the emotional hook and identification with characters to be missing. But, here it is complete disinterest in how his life turns out or what events lead up to that. Also, the scenes where the audience is being twirled between imagination and reality get a little tedious. Except for some witty dialogue (most of which again you have seen in the trailer), the writing misses target.Protagonist Mandar (Gulshan Devaiah) is a guy on the street who is always looking out for women. Not to be confused with “watching out for women” – just in case the word 'protagonist' in the context of a Hindi film, threw you off. He's the guy who looks at women in a way that'd make women uncomfortable. But for some reason, none of the women he looks at in the film experience discomfort with his attention. I guess the player that he is, he knows his way around. If it were not for the performances, the novelty of Hunterrr would have died down very quickly turning it into a very sleazy affair. Gulshan Devaiah gives the creeps and goes shy in sync with the need of the scene. As a natural progression, there is a certain amount of tackiness in the way he approaches the women. But hey, if the women don't mind his overtures, you respect their choice and accept the events. Which in turn means that all the women are convincing. Radhika Apte has a certain ease with which she performs. You end up believing her reactions in the weirdest of situations (across films). Other than that, there are some social references in the film which are rather overt – from safe sex to child sex abuse or paternal abuse of girl child to our preference for the fair when it comes to the fairer gender and so on. These seem out of place because the film is otherwise very comfortable in its space of sex comedy. These other things kind of jump out as awkward in trying to prove that the film is more than what it is – a justification for sexual gestures and norms from groping to men befriending women with only one intention; it is all a part of growing up, you see. Fortunately for the film and unfortunately for real life, this explanation is how it is. Only some boys become men sooner rather than later. Sure, we do need films that talk about sexuality – both male and female. There is a lot of talk about representing the sexual needs of women in films. But, the sexual needs of men too aren't addressed other than in the context of rape. Hunterrr is fresh in that context. Beyond that though, it is a regular coming-of-age plus love story. Not very interesting once you get past the “different” part of the background.

The Hurt Locker is not your typical war movie. It is a film that shows the monotony in the face of danger. Go without any pre-conceived notions and chances are you’ll appreciate the film and empathise with its protagonists.,"There was a time not very long ago when American war movies were all about patriotism and sacrifice. The last few years however have contributed a lot in the changing of this perspective. The noughties began with the fall of the Twin Towers and ended with the Rrecession. Somewhere in between these two grand events Bush started his infamous Iraq campaign that would change the way the world viewed at war. The initial jingoism has now given way to weariness with movies now focusing more on the man in the bunker, as the reasons he was fighting for become more and more meaningless.The Hurt Locker is one such film, set in Iraq and telling the story of an elite bomb disposal squad. It is as much a story of the insecurities of the commandos as it is about the lack of choices for one man -- Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner), who smokes cigarettes and goes about disposing explosives like he’s taking a walk in the park.James is good, heck he’s brilliant -- in tune with the wires and the bombs he is about to defuse, at times even respectful to the person who has assembled the circuit. He is very sure of himself, at times so sure he doesn’t care to wear his protective suit! But he is also very reckless, leaving Sanbourn (Anthony Mackie) the man in charge of watching his back, in a very unenvious position.So there you have, Sanbourn a complete contrast to James, working with him and trying his best to protect him and perhaps his own ulcer.But Hurt Locker isn’t a film that dwells so much on the contrasts as much as it shows the monotony in the face of danger. Director Kathryn Bigelow manages to achieve this with her hand-held camera movements, lack of background score, some superb close-ups and a narrative style that puts you in the heat of things.The Hurt Locker in a sense is not a typical war movie. There aren’t as many explosions you might have wanted and definitely not as many gunfights either. Instead there are portions in this movie when absolutely nothing happens. There is no music and there are very little visuals. At one point the screen goes entirely blank for a good few seconds. The beauty of this film lies in these moments. Bigelow manages to take you right into the scene of action and the slow pace only goes to show how killing anticipation can be. Having said that though, it also must be said that The Hurt Locker isn't a conventional entertainer that will make you walk out of the theatre and say a-ha! It gnaws on you, tests your patience to the point that you want Sanbourn and James to go home. I might also go to the extent of saying that perhaps you might also walk out of the theatre feeling somewhat disappointed because it doesn't fit into the parameters of a 'war movie'. But if you are patient enough and perhaps a little considerate. You might just understand what the sniper lying in one position all day waiting to shoot is going through.The director treads the line between action and suspense very well. You see things from the protagonist’s mind and see just what makes him do what he does. Sure, James is the hero of the film. And for a lot of his colleagues he probably is a war hero? But does he consider himself to be one is a question that Bigelow attempts to answer. And she does a very good job at it.

It's non-judgmental and makes you feel for each of its characters. Each story is so beautifully scripted that you don't really care if they are linked to each other or not. Nor does it bother you that you don't know how they all fit in on a timeline. You are willing to go with the flow and take it matter-of-factly when a character from one story appears in another one without any specific purpose.All that matters are the characters and what they are going through. Afia wants to be a mother, if she can't find a man, she'll get a donor. Everyone around her thinks she has gone nuts but you want to root for her. Megha is bitter, but you don't mind the resentment because she has after all been uprooted from her homeland in the most cruel fashion. How can you not feel for Abhimanyu who has been molested as a child, even though he has now turned into a person who doesn't mind using people around him. And Omar well, his story is more about the story and mistreatment afforded towards homosexuality rather than his character. You feel confused with the actors, you see their dilemma and their pain. If they are stubborn you want to give them the benefit of doubt. The treatment given to each story is consistent and has a very smooth flow. That must be some achievement considering it involved different teams working on each of them. Of course, there are times when you feel like there are some parts that you'd like to know more about. For example, Afia's story feels complete. But obviously for a topic as broad as the situation of the people in Kashmir, Megha's half-hour can do only so much justice. It still doesn't take away from the beauty that you feel bad for both her and her friend Rubina.Abhimanyu's story is also painted very broadly but then again, I'm not sure whether we want to know/see the gory details, especially when they are coming along with so many heavy issues. Same goes for Omar's homosexuality. The logistics are unclear but then again you don't know how much more you want to hear. All of this only makes me think that each one of these deserved a little more time, maybe even a film each. But as it stands, they are serious short films, have some brilliant performances, are well-shot and executed. A worthy watch, you just need to get into that serious mode.

Your smile will remain intact in these thirty minutes with the tongue-in-cheek humor. Then nothing happens for the next hour or so. An average movie-goer would know by now, how this story is likely to culminate. Thus no one is surprised by the climax in the last couple of reels. What surprised me though is that after having taken all cinematic liberties they actually tried to get away with dressing the lead lady (Vipasha Agarwal) in the same dress throughout the movie. Amazing!All the other characters are half-baked including the other main character. What her motivations are in whatever she does is not explained. But both Arjun and Vipasha look great. Arjun has performed well in patches. I wish actual TV hosts would speak as normally as he did. He was brilliant in some scenes and just-about-okay in some. His performance could, maybe, have been better if he didn’t have the extra stress of being the producer too. Just like an Indian cricket captain can’t bat consistently due to the additional pressure. Though most of Vipasha’s scenes needed her to just smile knowingly, she does show promise. Chunkey Pandey has given a controlled performance. Bomani Irani and Sonali Kulkarni are wasted in loud roles. Why are these typical loud roles so irrestible for directors? I truly hope the special appearances by Shah Rukh Khan and Hrithik Roshan were not to rope in their fans to the theatres. The problem is that the romantic scenes don’t make you feel for the characters. The touchy ones don’t pull any heart strings. There are some really good funny dialogues but they aren’t enough to last the movie. There are half-decent songs but no poetry. Everything looks like it has not been fully thought through.

Its simplicity is works as both an advantage and a disadvantage. The easy-going narrative is a pleasant watch but too-good-to-be-true plot is distracting.,"I am Kalam is a beautiful film. It romanticizes friendships, loneliness, class divides, political borders, ambition and of course roadside dhaabas and Rajasthan too. If only, the story held a little stronger or had a little more depth than aspiring young boy struggles to get what he wants. I am Kalam is mainly the tale of young Chhotu who has given himself an alias - Kalam - after the former president of India.  Dr. A. P. J Abdul Kalam is this little boy's inspiration. This little boy who works at a roadside dhaba cheerfully instead of grunting about going to school. He wants to go, but he can't afford to. As expected, the film has emotional moments and a strong message. But the moments are endearing and the message is well-hidden under a basic, sensitive story. However, the story is a little more than just the story of Chhotu. It has other characters and their personalities that represent an older generation that has lost all hope and a part of Gen X from the interiors of India - the lazy, insecure and mean part. These digressions take away from the film because the approach to these side-stories is half-hearted. I don't have material to empathize with Bhati (Gulshan Grover) or to want to give Laptan (Pitobash) one hard slap. And this is despite the fact that they have given awesome performances. You see the humility in Gulshan Grover's eyes and Pitobash annoys appropriately. But I don't care to love or hate them. The cuts in the film, that take you to their stories, give you the feeling that in the urge to keep the running time down, the makers gave up on the flow. The choppiness was disconcerting. And so was the side-story of the kings from the yesteryears who have lost their glory. Fortunately, what matters is that Harsh Mayur who plays the protagonist is ever-so appealing with the twinkle in his eye. The rags he wears matter not, because of the wide grin he strides with. The spring in his step make you even more aware of his dire situation and the lesson or two you can learn from him. Both the actor and the character are equally responsible for the fine experience that Chhotu is. And yet, the main story has a lot to say and I am Kalam says it with love. Its strength is in the subtlety with which it raises a question. What is chhotu thanking Kalam for? How would Dr. Kalam react if he actually met chhotu who labors at his tender age?

With good action and typical story, this film is bitter-sweet. ","So here comes another movie that is based on superpowers, mysterious aliens, and leaves scope for sequels. The title and the narration sound great, even though the trailer doesn’t look very promising. John Smith (Alex Pettyfer) and others are being hunted down by Mogadorians, and he is fourth on the list. 
The action is really good. It is fast, opens the film brilliantly, and has special effects that I loved. Add to it the sound effects and it’ll keep you on the edge of your seat. But these action scenes last for a very small duration. And the plot is so typical that it’s depressing. The worn out terrain of good against evil has been moulded into a teenage story. The movie doesn’t even focus on the alien-vs-alien-on-earth concept.
The direction was a little disappointing too. I mean, people don’t go to high school photography labs and make out when the bad guys are right behind! Clichés are used to the fullest - ‘blending in’ immediately translates to wearing the hood of a jacket. And John’s guardian, Henri, has 4-6 computer screens only so that he can delete any pictures of John on the internet. There of course was a lot of unbelievable stuff mainly because it was executed very unconvincingly. Like say, what stone glows so bright blue in blazing sun? Dialogues have little punch and little taste. 
They concentrated more than necessary on the love story instead of plot development. No flashbacks, no villains histories, no heroic escapes were shown or even talked of. Plus there are no explanations to why things happen the way they are. And whatever little explanation is given is far from satisfying. For example, why are the 9 of them being hunted down, or why are the bad guys so bad? Let’s hope they come up the explanations in the sequel. 
The love story is a boring teenage tragedy. One could easily fall asleep in that part. I should admit though, that the performances were surprisingly good. Okay, at least better than the Twilight Saga. Timothy Olyphant who plays John’s guardian, Henri is worth a mention. Even if he is over protective, there is concern and passion in his eyes – something I believe is hard to do. Others are decent for amateurs.
And like a friend said – the movie would definitely have sold better if it had been named ‘I Am Number Six’. Teresa Palmer plays the hot, confident Number 6 who is also being hunted down, and watches John’s back. Hot chick, hot action, hot bike. What else do you want?
So if you want to get the best out of movie, watch the action, sleep through the high school drama.

437,535,535,535,535,I'm Not There,Owner's Pride!,wogma reviewNotepad3 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/im-not-there-review/,,4/5.0,,4.433333333,A Contemplative fantasy about the artiste Bob Dylan portrayed through disparate characters and a non linear narrative.,"Bob Dylan has remained and remains a source of endless frustration for his fans, critics, and foes. Ceaseless speculation about his motives has followed him throughout his nearly fifty years of recording and performing music. His music stubbornly refuses to be categorized. He has been hated, vilified, adored, and glamorized. 
So how does one talk about him when sheaves of words have been said? How does one understand who the “real” Bob Dylan is? How does one go about trying to make a film about his life?Director Todd Haynes wisely eschews any attempt at making a documentary or a biographical epic; what he does instead is to visualize Dylan as six different characters none of whom bear the name Dylan. These characters could either be interpreted as different stages in the life and evolution of the artist, or they could be seen as an attempt to decipher what Dylan means to the soul of America, based on what is known of his life and times, as well as his repeated attempts to redefine his persona. Or they could just be the fabrications of the director, as he attempts to grapple with the constantly shifting shadows cast by Dylan’s multiple psyches. Take your pick. The film does not have a plot as such; what we have are multiple strands portrayed by the different characters with each strand connecting and interconnecting in a complex weave. The film opens with a grainy black and white point of view shot of a performer being escorted onto the stage; we go up the steps, past various ushers, and then into the blinding light and noise of the stage; the viewer is reborn into Dylan’s world. We see Dylan as a young eleven year old African American Woody Guthrie riding the freight train complete with a guitar, as Arthur Rimbaud who appears to be deposing before some sort of committee / press group, as Billy the Kid, as a film star Robbie, as a folk singer Jack Rollins, and as an electrified, druggy, Jude Quinn. It is Jude Quinn that the director seems to love the most. Quinn is played by Cate Blanchett, and she is turned in a virtuoso performance. Elfin, gamine, cynical, whiny, gaunt, riddler, jester, trickster; she does it all with such panache. Her mannerisms, her walk, all bring back the Dylan of the early 60’s. Christian Bale is perfect as the early Dylan, all hunched up mumbler. The late Heath Ledger is Robbie, a cross between James Dean, Marlon Brando, and Al Pacino. Richard Gere looking slightly addled and world worn, is Billy. All the characters seem to have been chosen for their links to Dylan’s life and music. To comprehend what each of these characters mean in the context of Dylan’s life and times, one would have to be familiar with the myth, magic, and music of the man. The visual palette of the film is stunning; each segment differs according to the time period, grainy black and white footage for the late 50’s and early 60’s, green pastel shades with glorious yellows for Billy and Woody, and dark brown and blue green frames for the 70’s segments of Robbie. The frames are technically superb in terms of the colour and visual design; they immediately transport the viewer into the respective time period. The frames also show us some of the most singular faces shot in black and white and colour; working men, African Americans, women and children. Subtitles are not used to state the year and month; instead the director lets the viewer grasp time instinctively. This renders the film as memory, a personal memory with no clear cut dates and markers. The director thus suggests that the film is not a history or a document or a record of times past.  The best visuals are reserved for the Jude Quinn sequences; completely Fellinesque, surreal and hallucinatory, they are a potent elixir. There is a phantasmagoric Andy Warhol party sequence, complete with projection walls, sharp black and white contrast frames, and the people all clothed in cool. References, cross references, and allusions abound throughout the film but the director makes no attempt at analysis or explanation. 
For viewers who are unfamiliar with Dylan, this film does not offer any clues. In that sense it is not at all like a conventional biopic that explicates significant events in the character’s life. This film is instead an adroit amalgamation of all that Dylan was, could be, and possibly will be. And through it all runs the music; sensational, stirring, heart stopping music. The music is used at key points to enhance the visuals; a love affair and its eventual disintegration is set to Visions of Johanna, I Want You, and a Simple Twist of Fate. Which other director could be this lucky?We see the “real” Dylan only at the end; a few minutes of footage of Bob Dylan improvising on harmonica on what sounds like I Want you. But before that we have seen much, much more; of all the images, the image of Jude Quinn gazing into the camera with a quixotic amused expression stays with us.  So does the sound of the harmonica as it blends with the whistle of the freight train and resounds in the valley. Dylan rides free as we speak; Billy says in the last lines of the movie “It's like you got yesterday, today and tomorrow, all in the same room. There's no telling what can happen.” If you are a Dylan fan, see this film again and again and again. Savour it, relish it, and wallow in the sheer exuberance of it.

Sure, we know enough people around us who are full of themselves, but doesn't make watching them in a film any more interesting. ","It's bad enough that life has its share of people who can't stop talking about themselves and how cool they are. Why would I want to watch these characters on screen? Especially when they are being superficial about being full of themselves. I, Me Aur Main is too plain vanilla a story despite being different in that it is modern in its take on relationships, at least in a very broad stroke. It suffers from the usual complaint of not having a single character who you can root for. Even though there is Anushka (Chitrangda Singh) who is obviously in the right, you don't know enough about her to root for her. It doesn't help that Chitrangda Singh is getting worse at emoting with every film. Wide eyes and pointed lips make for a lovely face to look at, but they don't once convince you about anything they are saying. Especially, with a put-on accent that makes the entire act seem even more fake. Prachi Desai on the other hand is vibrant and you want to know her character, Gauri more. But, of course, you aren't let in except for the token scenes featuring her flamboyant and confident nature.  John Abraham plays his wooden self, except for a couple of scenes where he makes you really believe how oblivious he is to other people's existence, his character, Ishaan is. The situations themselves are hardly connected. They are a series of supposedly fun and not-so-fun events stringed together. Yet, there are a couple of scenes that are done well. I especially liked the awkward moment created for Anushka at Ishaan's sister's house. Thematically, the modern solution found by a couple who doesn't get along with each other but wants to be together for one reason or other is pretty mature, especially when found in a film that has not much mature about it otherwise. It is almost like the writer hit upon this idea he wanted to convey and worked backwards to form a story towards that end.  Another aspect of today's life that I, Me Aur Main touches upon is the mandatory relationship that the 60+ generation finds itself in. This is a generation who doesn't see separation or divorce as an option. This is a generation that hasn't necessarily experienced love in the romantic sense of the word. I understand I, Me Aur Main is hardly about this facet of life, but since it broached the subject, I would have loved to see more of it.Another interesting decision in terms of film-making was the one of having just the one lip-sync song. Considering Ishaan is a producer of singing stars, there was certainly room for more. Yet, the lack of songs is not sufficient either to make a good film now, is it?With quite a few, small things going in the right direction for I, Me Aur Main, the film in its entirety still feels like too shallow a take at relationships. Quite in sync with its title protagonist, but not good enough a metaphor to take it through being even a half-decent watch.

However, in terms of novelty Ice Age has nothing – visually or in the story. The first thing that comes to mind when I think “Ice Age” is Ray Romano's voice. By itself the voice has a quality that is entertaining. However, too much of any thing borders unbearable. In Ice Age Collision Course, the voice sounds more like an annoying drawl. The rest of the characters are asked to shriek and shrill they are. Every character is excited and therefore every voice sounds urgent, in panic or just out of control. A lot like a slapstick film. Even though, thankfully, Ice Age Collision Course is not too slapsticky, it is a good thing that the loud circus lasts for only about 95 minutes.Ice Age Collision Course could have pretty much done without 3D - except for the “acorn causing havoc” phases of the film, maybe. The film doesn't even try to use the technology creatively. Just like it doesn't even try to write a new plot. A bunch of animals are trying to escape some geological phenomenon. Because cuteness coefficient of animals > human, family values and emotions we associate with humans are enacted by animals. That too with lazy and lame writing. There are a few smiles but they are few and far between. Ice Age Collision Course has just about enough to engage its target audience – kids who have followed the franchise. After all, they get their dose of pop corn and soda along with it.

440,538,538,538,538,Ice Age: Continental Drift,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/ice-age-continental-drift-review/,,3/5.0,,2.066666667,"There are some films where you know the humor isn’t of an adult level. You give such films the benefit of doubt, assuming that you’re older now, whose interests have changed. During Ice Age 4 however, even the children were getting restless at several points. Maybe the makers should take this as a hint, and invest in fresher scripts. (Please note that I have been a fan of the franchise, but only till the second film. You have to draw the line somewhere.)","I still remember when the first Ice Age released me and my best friend were staunch Shrek followers: the kind who would dismiss any other animation film. But when we saw Ice Age we were immediate converts. Ice Age was simple, funny and the characters were adorably relatable. But with each film, the franchise became more about minting money than rediscovering the characters and creating offshoots of the narrative. Ice Age: Continental Drift is the epitome of exactly that phenomenon – it’s formulaic, the jokes are puerile and predictable and your kids might like it, but kids like Bol Bachchan these days as well. (Oh, you’d be surprised with their reactions)In the first few minutes we’re introduced to the regulars; Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo), sabre-toothed Diego (Denis Leary), Manny the mammoth (Ray Romano). Here Manny can’t bear the fact that his daughter, Peaches (Keke Palmer), is all grown up. As the movie progresses, he gets separated from his family, along with Diego and Sid, and the adventure entails his quest back home. They encounter a panther pirate (Jennifer Lopez), a walrus (Nick Frost) and a batch of sea-animals led by an Orangutan (Peter Dinklage) on their way. While they are meant to be worthy distractions for the trio, it’s one too many characters. The restlessness could be seen, even among kids, and with time the gags stopped being funny. Even the squirrel Scrat isn’t any respite, as his antics are mostly done in the earlier films. What makes the movie worse is an unnecessary overdose of the wisdom of parenting, love and all that. While the animation is charming and you find some solace in watching a film where the protagonists have been the same, the plot becomes heavy with so many gimmicks. The jokes and the comedy are funny in the beginning, and that’s mostly because you’ve watched the three previous films. For a first time viewer, Ice Age: Continental Drift is nothing but a animated mash of colors and loud, overdone jokes. Here’s my theory: a fourth franchise of Ice Age was never going to be a fun movie. There’s only so much you can recycle, plot and gag-wise. At some point, the film will get tedious, and cyclical. It’s a pity because when such films are released you wonder what other films could have been made (maybe more than one film) in that much money. It’s a vicious cycle.

441,539,539,539,539,[The] Iceman,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review,/movie/iceman-review/,,,,2.066666667,"Michael Shannon’s performance in the title role of a real life contract killer, and the mood that this Ariel Vromen thriller manages to create make it worth a watch, but not for everyone.","Michael Shannon is clearly a complex actor. Staid, stoic and with not exactly the widest range of expressions to offer, he was last seen as the superhero’s archenemy in a recent summer blockbuster. Even there, his ice-cool, steely demeanour was what added an air of menace about him, never mind that the character itself had a moral ambiguity about it, which made it hard to hate or fear him outright.In fact, Ariel Vromen’s The Iceman, a film that premiered internationally last year, probably found its release at this opportune time because of the worldwide visibility that Michael Shannon received courtesy Man of Steel. A dark, brooding character study of a contract killer who manages to keep that part of his identity a secret even from his immediate family, the film’s measured pace, sombre atmosphere and Michael Shannon’s turn as the real life Richard Kuklinski, on whom this film is based, are what hold the film together, despite its rather erratic writing and slight unwieldiness in directorial craft.Of course, what really intrigues you is Richard Kuklinski himself. It is hard to imagine a man who so easily takes up contract killing as a profession, who doesn’t seem to have a moral compass that guides him with regard to the rights and wrongs of his actions. He is absolutely unflappable in the face of a crisis (as long it doesn’t involve his family), and doesn’t hesitate before taking a human life even if it isn’t part of a contract.And yet, Richard Kuklinski was a living, breathing person; a man who took hundreds of lives and who seemed to show no remorse whatsoever. In that sense, The Iceman offers you no real graph. Despite the fact that the film gets its noir feel nearly right, it offers no real plot, no sense of anticipation in terms of a twist or two.A straight, bleak, stark narrative will always feel like a documentation of facts, as opposed to a real story with an emotional core that one can hang on to. The only times one can identify with Richard Kuklinski as a real human being is when he displays his love for his family, and even that is done with a sense of cold detachment. However, director Arial Vromen seems most out of sorts when he is trying to make this juxtaposition between the cold-blooded killer and the family man. This, precisely this, is where Michael Shannon’s performance saves the film.The Iceman was an epithet given to Kuklinski himself, but it can very well apply to Shannon too. His physical appearance changes through the film, but the iciness remains the same. The expressions are minimal, but the emotions he manages to convey even without changing his expression is testament to what a unique actor he is - so much so that the man is literally a part of the mood that the film creates. One almost gets the feeling that just taking him out of the frame would brighten things up a bit. Ray Liotta plays Roy DeMeo, the mob boss who recruits Kuklinski and kickstarts his killing career. Liotta is in terrific form once again, maliciously towering over every other character in the film, even Kuklinski, when they share the frame. Chris Evans, in a completely different avatar as a grungy yet affable killer himself, is excellent in his tiny role. The weak link in the film in terms of choice of actor as well as performance is Winona Ryder, who plays Kuklinski’s wife. Apart from the fact that she doesn’t age one bit through the film, her performance comes across as false one time too many.Despite the interesting one-line premise The Iceman offers, as a film it doesn’t particularly ‘entertain’ you, if that’s what you’re looking for. What it does rather well though, is manage to engage you by creating a dark little world, provided you are willing to submit yourself to it. The Iceman isn’t for everyone; it is mostly for those who don’t mind feeling a little cold deep, deep within.

442,540,540,540,540,[The] Imitation Game,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review2 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/imitation-game-review/,,5/5.0,,2.733333333,"The Imitation Game, a biopic on mathematician and code breaker Alan Turing, is a beautifully crafted film; it looks good, sounds great and feels authentic. Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Turing enhances it further. Though it doesn't go as deep into Turing's psyche as it thinks it does, it still makes for a thoroughly engaging film. ","Right at the start of the The Imitation Game, the central character of Alan Turing speaks out in a voice-over, asking someone (as well as you, the audience) to pay attention to whatever is going to follow. This act, of trying to coerce the audience into paying attention and understanding what's being said & shown, either by being blatant about it and stating it aloud as in this case, or by repeatedly reinforcing an already established fact or event, is perhaps the biggest problem with Morten Tyldum's film. It happens time and again throughout. If this had been avoided, and more time was devoted, instead, to unpeeling more facets of Turing's personality, the film could have been a masterclass in how to make a period biopic. Then again, the film as it is currently, still makes for a racy, engaging, at times even heartwarmingly funny, experience.Based on the life of mathematician Alan Turing, whose work in designing and building computing machines played a large part in the Allied Forces' victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, The Imitation Game works because of the stunning real life story of Turing, as well as Benedict Cumberbatch's impassioned portrayal of the man.The most brilliant minds usually belong to the loneliest, most eccentric of people. Alan Turing was what one would consider a 'deviant' in more ways than one. While the bulk of the film is spent on Turing's work in cracking the codes enciphered by the German machine Enigma, the film also flashes back to Turing's youth intermittently, as we get to know a bit of why Turing was as he was in his later years.He was an unsung hero for the longest time, Turing; so the film is emotional, edgy and always intriguing. The film also touches upon a number of sensitive topics that seem just as relevant today than they did back when Turing was alive. The casual but rampant sexism that existed back then, for instance. Again, these are only scratched at the surface.  Eventually, the film does make the point that just how a man and a machine think differently, even two different individuals can think differently. Logically, it follows that there is no right and wrong, no clear moral or social lines, despite what history and society have conditioned us to believe. The Imitation Game gets the period look and feel spot on, but perhaps the biggest contributor to making it truly immersive almost throughout, is Alexandre Desplat's background score. Though it isn't the most original sounding score around, it always works in tandem with the emotional timbre of the scene, playing the role of glue between the hearts of the audience and the characters.Then, there are the performances. Benedict Cumberbatch consumes Turing (or the other way round), with every twitch, every mannerism seeming like it came from somewhere deep within. It isn't a flawless performance, only because one can see shades of his Julian Assange performance here as well. But the soul clearly overshadows the craft, leading to a thoroughly effective portrayal. The gorgeous Keira Knightley, with her crooked teeth and lanky frame, warms your heart with a performance that balances strength with vulnerability.Like I mentioned earlier, one can't help get the feeling that the film doesn't seem to want to go into what Turing really was like deep, deep inside. It delves into plenty of facts, yes, but it could have been so much more powerful if Tyldum hadn't chosen to make a simple story seem like it is a complex tale. The deepest, darkest layers of Alan Turing, it seems, are destined to be an enigma, much like the man himself. This film on his life, though, is a well-crafted, gripping film.

443,541,541,541,541,Inception,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review15 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/inception-review/,,4/5.0,,2.4,"Inception cements Christopher Nolan’s place in the big league of the world’s greatest film-makers. Alas, the DVD does not even give us a Director’s Commentary, a Behind the Scenes or even a detailed interview with the cast and crew – all of which would have provided much juice to our discussions and interpretations about the most discussed film this year. Still, the film demands repeat viewings to be understood completely and that’s perhaps the single reason why you should buy the DVD.","Possibly the most discussed and debated films this year, and a clear favourite at the Oscars, Inception arouses a strong urge to get into the mind of Christopher Nolan, in a similar way one wanted to get into the mind of the Wachowski brothers after watching The Matrix. Once inside, you want to ask him a simple question, ""How the hell did you think of something like this?""The story is unique and the arguments that Inception puts forward about dreams, reality and the human sub-conscious are almost entirely convincing. Nolan mounts the premise with edge of the seat thrills, gravity defying action and an ensemble of interesting characters, each of whom brings something unique to the table. Inception  tells the story of Dobb (Leonardo Di Caprio), a skilled extractor of valuable secrets that dwell in the subconscious of the human brain, who has to finish one last assignment before he can meet his kids. Cobb's technique is called extraction: entering a person's dream, and stealing an existing idea during his vulnerable dream state. His latest assignment however is a challenging one, called inception, where he has to plant an idea, rather than steal it. Dobb is however challenged with his past which he must confront and conquer in his dreams, to be able to pull of this task. Leonardo is convincing as Cobb, as is the team he assembles. Ellen Page, who plays the architect Ariadne, responsible for creating the world of the dream, almost sleeps through her role (no pun intended). Joseph Godron Lewitt plays Arthur, and makes a fine transition from being chocolate boy to Dobb's suave partner in crime. The big surprise is Marion Cotillard, who plays Mal, and is a formidable nemesis to Cobb. She's graceful, her eyes are deceptive and it doesn't take long for you to dislike her character. Tom Hardy, who plays Eames, uses his charisma to good effect, delivering some of the best lines in the film. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is responsible in a big way for maintaining the constant state of tension throughout the film. There's fear, desperation, doom, helplessness, exhilaration, satisfaction - only a genius can induce such versatility in a common theme through music. In its conclusion, Nolan ties up all loose ends, not that there are many, since the narration is linear, devoid of too many flashbacks or experimental jumps in the screenplay. He also takes great care in simplifying the idea of inception for the layman. Cobb's explanation of dreams and architecture to Ariadne is spectacular, clearly one of the visual highpoints of the film. In Cobb’s references to ideas and their significance of them, Nolan touches upon a bigger issue - the theft of an idea, an intellectual property over which humans are yet to exercise their copyrights. Some say that geeks will eventually rule the world. My feeling is that only the geek with the right firewalls to his brain will. Why, another film that released this year,The Social Network is about a lawsuit over the theft of an idea. Inception also made me ponder over why human beings change their mind, after having decided on something. Why is it, that when presented with an idea that’s immediately not acceptable, do we say, “It’s okay. Let’s sleep it over.” What exactly happens in our sleep, that has the potential to change the way we feel about something, the morning after? And if not, what helps us keep our first impressions intact? Inception is a significant film in Nolan's career, as he proves that acclaim for The Dark Knight was no flash in the pan. With this film, he has cemented his place alongside the likes of Spielberg, Cameron, Scorcese. The fact that he's much younger than each of them gives cinegoers a great future to look forward to. One of reasons I was keenly looking forward to the DVD of this film, was to hear Nolan's thought process while shaping the story, converting it into the film, and convincing the folks at Warner Bros. to back it. Unfortunately, the DVD, despite being a two-disc set, does not give me any answers. The special features on the additional disc, do not have a ""Behind the Scenes"" either. There is not even a detailed interview with the film-maker, cast and crew, reactions from the producers as to what they thought when they heard the film's story for the first time. Fans of Nolan would have clearly wanted to see much more of him. Inception certainly commands at least a second viewing. I've seen it thrice, and I've been able to spot something new in each of those occasions. In its first viewing, the film seemed to be a story about a mind-heist, that introduced a rather radical but believable invasion of dreams. The second viewing, made it seem more to be a story about a man’s struggle to get back home to his kids. The third viewing (which happened on DVD), convinced me that security of our subconscious may not be such a radical concept after all. But what worried me more, was the realisation, that in each viewing, we’re cheering for inception, a robbery, which Cobb says “is not strictly speaking, legal”. We live in strange times.

Spielberg must have wondered as to what he should do with the script of this film, coming as it does nearly twenty years after the last Indy film and twenty seven years after Raiders of the Lost Ark, the film that made Indiana Jones into a cult hero in pop culture.  In the interim, innumerable blockbuster action adventures have made their way onto screens the world over. When Raiders of the Lost Ark was released in 1981 it signaled the birth of the monster blockbuster and practically set the trend for swashbuckling action adventures.  Post that, we have had films as varied as Romancing the Stone to King Solomon’s Mines to the recent execrable National Treasure, all of which owe their existence to Raiders.    So what does the latest Indy film have to offer?  Unfortunately, it offers the same elements as the first one – elaborate action set pieces – three in all, including the one at the opening of the film, dry banter between the lead characters, and a plot that involves archaeological hocus pocus with an accent on the paranormal.  I used the word unfortunately, because it is all been done before and Spielberg has nothing new to offer to the viewer either in terms of style or content.  So we have the mouldy caves and rotting mummies, flesh eating ants, mysterious riddles written in long forgotten languages, and exotic locales – the Amazon in this case, not to forget the search for some absolutely super duper mysterious artifact.  While the enemies in the earlier films (Raiders and Holy Grail) were the Nazis, this film situated in 1957, has the Russians playing the evil ones at the height of the Cold War, and so we have Cate Blanchett as a very Rosa Klebb type of character (remember From Russia with Love) with a super pseudo Russian accent and creased military pants.  Spielberg has stuck to the comic book feel of the earlier Indy films, and the set pieces are quite standard.  True to form, two set pieces involve motor vehicle chases, with Indiana Jones leaping in and out of moving vehicles and Shia LeBeouf indulging in some Douglas Fairbanks style swordplay.  Spielberg does throw in an occasional surprise, as in the sequence where Indy stumbles onto a nuclear testing site.  The other sequence where a motorcycle chase ends in a library is also pretty good.  I missed Sean Connery and his witty comments; what we get here is the banter between Harrison Ford and Shia LeBeouf, which for the most part is quite flat.  The climax is all CGI generated, and quite tame.  Yes, I felt nostalgic while watching this film and thinking of the years gone by, but that is all this film is likely to do for the fans of Indiana Jones.  For the viewer who has not seen an Indy film before I would highly recommend a viewing of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, you could safely give this one a miss!

445,543,543,543,543,Indu Sarkar,Watch when on TV/online,wogma reviewPreview27 Critic Reviews 1.9/5.0,/movie/indu-sarkar-review/,1.9/5.0,,,2.866666667,"Intertwining stories of Indu Sarkar, the protagonist and Indira's sarkar leave the movie neither here nor there.","There are a few ways to think of Indu Sarkar. One as a story of a woman who happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time and that too during  one of the most suppressive times of independent India – a coming-of-age movie of sorts. Another could be a historical documentation of the 1975 emergency that uses the story of this woman as a narrative tool. And yet another is a not-so subtle, hint-hint-nudge-nudge comment calling out similarities between people from the “democratic” governments, then and now, who want to control the common man. The problem is that this is not through the viewer's interpretation; the film is actually trying to do all three together.This is evident from the word go, the pun in the name of the film itself is mildly amusing. The story unfolds in fits and starts. One of the main reasons for that feeling is that the scenes linger way too long to let the drama build or the trauma sink in. But, as is usually so when there is a pause for contemplation, the audience has checked out from the film to check their phones.Thankfully, dialogue does interrupt the long pauses. But the relief is only brief because the lines are either too filmy, repetitive or are to spoon-feed the audience. For instance, showing an elderly man and a little boy being taken in for sterilization is not enough, their ages are actually called out. Or the comparison of a goddess with the reigning lady prime minister in a poem is actually explained. In that sense, the writers are smart. But they don't want to risk it going unnoticed thus making their effort counter-productive. As for the repetition, I never understand it when films show the planning of an event and its execution in great detail or when it shows the event and then a character recall the entire thing. Just in case you are wondering, Indu Sarkar is guilty of both. It is interesting that the timeline in the film was guided through film posters, making the Hindi film industry an important witness to what was going on in the nation. I actually remembered watching films like Upkaar and Namak Haraam as a child that had a similar tone as Indu Sarkar. The importance of the Hindi film world is even exemplified with the common man uniting over a Kishore Kumar song. As far as the music goes, I liked the rendition of 'chadhta suraj', I liked that the original wasn't tinkered around with much. The background score gets overwhelming at times and stays in the background at others. The sepia tone gives the film the grim look it wants to carry. That leaves us with the performances. Indu Sarkar, the protagonist, carries the rebellion against the emergency on her shoulders and Kirti Kulhari, the actor does the same for Indu Sarkar, the film. Neil Nitin Mukesh seems menacing. For the first 5 seconds. After that he just seems grumpy and then it all falls apart when he pauses at the wrong places. Tota Roy Chowdhury is the only one who seems to be in complete control of his character.Despite all its shortcomings, I didn't mind the subject approached. Better getting excited about a film on the subject and being disappointed than not to have a film on the subject at all. Today, I saw two films that are lesser known chapters in Indian history – one from 40+ years ago and the other from 70+ years ago. Irrespective of the quality of the films and their accuracy, compared to those times and the sacrificers the generations before us made to just survive, we live in superbly liberated times. I wonder what a film 30-40 years later about today's times would look like. Would it feel like they are living in better times than now? I surely hope they don't think our live were like the third film I saw today. shudder

Answer: A raging hell that is Inferno but well in this case, one that is neither as hot nor shines as brightly.
And therein lies the rub - Inferno is a film that is less than the sum of its constituent parts. For while some of the parts - screenplay, back ground score, cinematography - work very well, others such as direction, storytelling and even some performances don't quite pull their weight.   Which means that writing a review for a movie such as Inferno doesn't necessitate a watching of it - for the most part it sticks to template and its viewing is purely incidental. And while there are only so many tropes that can be designed and tricks that can be pulled, the overall lack of novelty can rankle many a fan of the genre.   The one thing Inferno did for me - and is likely to do for you - is make you pine for Florence in all its Il Duomo and Davidesque resplendence and magnificence. The background score by Hans Zimmer is both reminiscent of the charm of the chase in the earlier two flicks in the series as also accounting for the intrigue in the present installment.   Elsewhere, for a book that is a size of a tome, coming up with a screenplay that has (a) coherence and cohesiveness, (b) running length of 2 hours and (c) stays true to the source material in letter, spirit and essence is both remarkable and in the end, partly redeeming.   Irrfan Khan, after what are ostensibly starting problems, is in fine fettle in the second half - seemingly having the most fun of em' all, whilst also staying refreshingly semi-serious. That too in a movie and amongst performances that otherwise take themselves too seriously, considering the material at hand.   In sum, Inferno is not a spectacularly bad movie but its just that it isn't a terribly good one either. For a review that started with an existential question, ending with a practical one would be fitting, yes?   So, should you watch it? Well, given the overall Italian flavour in the air, it would be shame not to invoke Elizabeth Gilbert's Eat, Pray and Love and its most celebrated cult phrase - especially given how well it channels the response here: Attraversiamo - 'lets cross over'.   Watch it if you must, give it a miss if you ain't up for shlock this weekend.

447,545,545,545,545,Inglourious Basterds,Owner's Pride!,wogma review8 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/inglourious-basterds-review/,,4/5.0,,2.533333333,"Inglourious Basterds is a gem. You cannot watch it once and leave it be. You have to turn to again, maybe a few weeks after watching it the first time, maybe after a few years again. Be rest assured you will find something new to explore and something new to enjoy.","“This is not how it happened!”  That was my friend’s reaction to a certain scene that involved Hitler and a bunch of ‘Basterds’ sent out to kill the Dictator. Here’s the thing about Inglourious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino’s latest film to have hit the screens and bagged a handful of Oscar nominations: It is not a historical. It is also not a war movie.  It is a movie that refuses to fall into any category and is most certainly a piece of fiction that everyone would have wished had come true. Inglourious Basterds is not so much about Hitler or about the fictional Lt Aldo Raine (played here by Brad Pitt) as much as it is about Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), the fictional Nazi colonel who has a nasty reputation of sniffing out Jews from their hiding places. Raine is in fact just another player, a cog in the wheel so to say, who leads a pack of eight Jewish-American soldiers to get behind the enemy lines and kill as many German soldiers as possible. With a little luck, Raine and his band of ‘Basterds’ even hopes to bump off Hitler. But Hitler is a big man. And a big man has a lot of enemies. As it turns out, without the Basterds’ knowing, the femme fatale Shosanna (Mélanie Laurent) is also plotting to bring down the Third Reich -- not so much because she is anti-establishment but because she has some personal scores to settle with the Jew-hating Nazis. Plots and subplots merge beautifully to the extent that at one point Shosanna’s story suddenly becomes all-important leaving behind the Basterds’ plans. In fact the leader of the Basterds has very little to do. Brad Pitt plays what in Bollywood is referred to as ‘an extended cameo’.  Sure he does a great job -- watch out for that scene where he speaks Italian -- but the truth is that the film, if it belongs to someone, it does to Christoph Waltz. Waltz is an Austrian actor, who according to Wikipedia has primarily done German language films. Interestingly he has played the philosopher Nitzche in one of his earlier works and in his next film he plays the psychologist Sigmund Freud. Thousands of bytes have been spent praising Waltz’s performance as the Jew Hunter so it won’t be a surprise if the man walks home with the Oscar for the Best Supporting Actor. The scene to watch out for is the opening scene of the film where Waltz walks into a French dairy certain that there are a bunch of Jews hiding right below his feet. The cold, calculated and casual conversation that Waltz has with the owner of the house before coolly gunning down everyone hiding below, except one, is a scene that will be remembered for the longest time. Yes, there is a lot of shooting, killing and bloodshed in Inglourious Basterds. But then again it is a Tarantino movie so what do you expect? The thing about IB is that it appeals to your basest instincts. One the one hand Landa’s killings make your hair stand but also make you look at him with some amount of awe while on the other you cheer for Shosanna and Raine as they inhumanly go about their plans. But like all Tarantino’s movies, this one too takes blood and gore to a different level, raising it (god help me for saying this) to a level of art. This is because Tarantino is a gifted artist. He loves movies and you can see it in every frame.  Tarantino pays tribute to popular English films through his background score as also to the expressionist movement playing on archetypes such as the Lady in Red. Inglourious Basterds is a brilliant movie. But chances are you will enjoy it more if you’ve been watching Hollywood movies over the decades. To draw a parallel -- Om Shanti Om will probably make you laugh even if you don’t know what the hell Bollywood is all about. But if you know your Barjatya from Maoj Kumar OSO is a gem you will want to have in your collection. To twist Shrek’s quote, Inglourious Basterds is like an onion… it’s got layers.

But, the story cheats on itself in the last half hour. ","On the surface, Inkaar is a story about sexual harassment in the workplace. But a layer under, it is about the inability of ambitious people coming to terms with their feelings, about how they use all resources available at their disposal to mask their complexes (superior and inferior) and insecurities. Does she really, truly believe she is being harassed? Are the devils in her mind perceiving casual flirtation as harassment? Is he flirting only casually? Does he not realise he is trying to evoke something deeper within her? Lovely, murky, gray areas. All rendered redundant by a climax that stands awesome by itself but loses its meaning and makes the film lose face in the context of the film. To do that to a story that broaches a serious abuse rampant in current times is belittling the issue. But, hey should we hold our directors responsible for taking on social agendas? So, if we take away the responsibility Inkaar makes for an interesting watch till about the last half hour and the last half hour is interesting by itself. It's the fact that they are put together that spoils the taste.The interest is built and maintained though by all departments. I have always liked the atmosphere Sudhir Mishra creates in his films. They are either set in the rural parts of India or they show the grit of the urban world (except Khoya Khoya Chand which was set in an era long past). Inkaar requires him to stay in the chic world of the cities today and I liked the sepia tone he chose for the film, giving it a dark, edgy feel. Though I don't associate brown with the corporate world. Yet, the camera work contributes to the highly strung atmosphere in the office of an advertising agency. However, the music, though good, seems out of place for the setting.Also, the back and forth in the story's linearity feels like a cop out. As if the makers weren't confident of pulling it off had it played out linearly. Fortunately, some of the dialogue is good and is even cheeky at times - bringing in the smiles and knowing nods. I especially enjoyed Arjun Rampal's performance. He brings in the perfect amount of nonchalance to Rahul Verma's demeanour - the kind that a calm, confident man would carry to make you believe that he is not in the wrong. Chitrangda Singh does nothing special except that she looks chic and just right for her part. I absolutely loved Deepti Naval's act - charming, witty, naughty and curious all rolled into one. It's a shame that ultimately her character seems like a cog in the wheel. Yet, another film where the makers seem to not want to take the concept all the way. Why not make it all about the 'sexual harassment'? Why not make it all about what it really wanted to be about - the part that I cannot give away? Why oh why, lessen the weight of the issue or the depth of emotions?

449,547,547,547,547,Inside Llewyn Davis,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/inside-llewyn-davis-review/,,5/5.0,,3.333333333,"Powered by a terrific performance by Oscar Isaac as the titular character, the Coen brothers' latest film, Inside Llewyn Davis, is about music, passion and the chase for success. A beautifully shot film with a terrific soundtrack, it isn't just a treat for the eyes and ears; it's a treat for the soul. ","How often have you heard someone say something to the effect, ""Oh, but he's an artist. It's okay, they're just like that!"" Sometimes, an artist is seen through a slightly different moral prism than the rest; a struggling artist even more so. A folk singer in Greenwich Village, New York, Llewyn Davis isn't exactly the nicest man in the world. He frequently pisses people off, often takes those close to him for granted, and, sometimes, he also behaves in a manner that can cause him to be described as a particularly unpleasant bodily orifice. And yet, in this beautifully atmospheric film by the Coen brothers - both, visually as well as aurally - you are drawn to him. He's down on his luck, and it seems to be getting worse by the passing day. Forget about knowing where his next paycheck is coming from, the poor fellow doesn't even know where his bed for the night will be; and it's a 60s winter that seems particularly chilly.Inside Llewyn Davis, the film, is like curling up beside a fireplace when it's snowing outside, with a favourite book for company. It's like listening to your favourite ballad on a rainy day. Most of all, especially for a wounded creative soul, it is like antiseptic-dipped cotton; you're not sure if it's hurting you or healing you.When an artist displays or performs an expression of his or her creativity for the first time in front of an audience, the time interval between the end of the performance and the first reaction of a viewer is like an eternity for the artist. That moment, which seems to last forever, is what the Coens capture so beautifully with Inside Llewyn Davis. And they do so while also making you smile almost throughout. How much can a person be pushed? How much failure can he or she take? How difficult is it to hear someone tell you that you aren't good enough? And worse; what if you start believing it yourself? The answers to these question depend on the individual, but they evoke universal emotional responses. Treated the way the Coens usually do, with their dark humour and visual flair, it's like you're on a road trip with Llewyn, and you just want it to last forever.You feel for his music; the pain is all there. Luckily, the film treats us to full songs, mostly performed by the protagonist himself. And what a soundtrack the film has! Calling it soul-stirring would be the most understated cliché in recent times; the Inside Llewyn Davis soundtrack is a haunting little gem.  Prior to watching the film, I was a little disappointed that the Coens' usual cinematographer, Roger Deakins, wasn't shooting this film. However, Bruno Delbonnel, who the Coens' have teamed up with this time, doesn't make you miss Deakins once through the entire film. Gorgeously shot, the film creates and maintains a melancholy mood throughout, with a dull green colour tone that alternately makes you feel the warmth of yellow and the cold of blue.It helps that Oscar Isaac is perfect as Llewyn Davis. He creates a character so endearingly flawed that you want to give him a hug for just being. Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund make memorable little appearances, big or small; but the most impressive supporting act of the film comes from an adorable little cat.Joel and Ethan Coen have, for me, one of the best filmographies in cinema. What's heartening to see is that their films seem to be getting more intimate, now, without losing out on what makes a Coen film in the first place. For me, personally, Inside Llewyn Davis struck home; because, as long as you have a sense of humour about it, there's nothing quite like the inside of an artist's head.

Above all it asks if you should really be seeking happiness with all your might.","Our mind is a pretty place. At least the way director/writer Pete Docter sees it. It is gorgeous, colorful and most of all it wants to stay happy. Well that's a no-brainer, right? But, have you ever seen animated emotions? You've felt animated emotions, but have you seen them? Have you ever imagined them interacting with each other? Inside Out's unique concept gets your attention from word go and keeps it there, despite a few manipulations here and there. The concept by itself takes a little while to wrap your head around. The entire theme is a metaphor, so there is always something more being said than what you hear. I don't remember the last time I saw a film that was so rich in profundity. It is constantly edging you to think and yet doesn't take itself too seriously. It goes about its business with good humor – satirical at times, plain knowing at others. Of course, like all metaphors, this one breaks down every once in a while too. You can see the writers wrecking their brains to get their characters, the emotions out of the soup they've gotten themselves into. And they take a jerky jump, asking you to take a leap of faith and just go along. Yes, it jars, but since you are watching one of the few films that have attempted this, you forgive and hop along. Just like, the documentary style introduction bothers but doesn't put you off. Even without the brain-tickling topic, Inside Out has many a thing to warrant a second viewing. The animation, the color-laden palette, the voices – each is as beautifully done as the other. I doubt though, that the film would be any less enjoyable if these were sub-par. After all, at its very base it poses spiritual questions like - should we really pursue happiness and struggle because of the unsuccessful pursuit? You also realise that the film has only scratched the surface of what goes on in your head. I could go into a lot more detail about how the film breezes through the inside view of so many little events of our day-to-day lives, but it is something you should experience rather than read.Yes, go ahead and witness this coming of age of feelings.

451,549,549,549,549,Insidious: Chapter 2,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/insidious-chapter-2-review/,,,,3.333333333,"James Wan returns with Insidious Chapter 2, and he bumps up the game from the first film, even if he doesn't quite recreate the thrills of The Conjuring, which came earlier this year. Still, Wan's growing ease with the genre and a truly interesting take on the narrative gives the sequel more than a point or two over the original.","James Wan's 2011 film Insidious had ended on a terrific note; a thrilling post-climactic twist that was worth almost as much as the entire film itself. The haunting woes of Josh Lambert and his family may not have been particularly scary, but it made for a taut little thriller that stayed with you. Now, two years later, and after getting that other excellent thrill-fest, The Conjuring, between himself and the first film, Wan is back with the sequel. Insidious Chapter 2 picks up almost immediately where the first film left off - the very next day, in fact. And this time, the film deals as much with Josh Lambert's past, as it does with his present and future...James Wan is slowly turning out to be a master of the horror-thriller genre. The instant difference that one can spot between Insidious and its sequel is Wan's maturity as a director. Of course, my personal pick out of his filmography still remains The Conjuring, but Insidious Chapter 2 is one of those rare sequels that effortlessly go notches above their predecessors, in virtually every department.What most films of this genre tend to mess up is the reason for the haunting. Clearly, Wan has figured out that the key to a successful supernatural story is the explanation behind the supernatural phenomena. Every film of his has the unmistakable aura of effort put in to crack a convincing backstory, and it shows in the manner in which he manages to always make you suspend your disbelief and get sucked in to the world of the paranormal.  Also, while the first film introduced us to The Further - a dark, parallel realm that is inhabited by beings that yearn to be alive but aren't - the second film takes the concept of The Further, further. In doing so, Wan and co-writer Leigh Whannell also beautifully play with space and time - and this is precisely the best part of the film; what makes it a tremendous step up from Insidious. Needless to say, watching the sequel without watching the first film will be quite pointless. The cast of the first film - Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Lin Shaye and Barbara Hershey amongst others - reprise their roles, and adequately lift their performances to go with the film. Patrick Wilson, in particular, really knocks it out of the park with his intensity and mystery that he infuses into the character of Josh Lambert. Also, young Ty Simpkins - who earlier taught Tony Stark a lesson or two in this year's summer blockbuster Iron Man 3 - returns as Josh's son Dalton, and it is refreshing to see a child in a horror film do something other than just be the manifestation or target of the haunting.What one misses in Insidious, as opposed to say Saw or The Conjuring, is a distinct sense of atmosphere that departs from a generic horror film feel. The Conjuring, in particular, scored so heavily, largely because of its grainy, period feel and the production design that complemented it so well. The Insidious films seem to rely more on conventional methods of scaring the audience, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. A tighter, sharper, smarter thriller than the first film, Insidious Chapter 2 makes you glad that Wan decided to not just revisit the story, but to turn the page as well.

452,550,550,550,550,Insomnia,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/insomnia-review/,,3/5.0,,2.666666667,"Insomnia is not just another film, which explores the grey area that a character falls into. Ridden with moral conflicts and psychological undertones, it’s a brilliant story that manages to get under your skin and makes you think. It’s an absorbing run and chase narrative with enough mind games to last you the entire duration of the film. Catch Insomnia for its powerful performances by Al Pacino and Robin Williams, and the thrilling visuals that promise you an-edge-of-the-seat action. ","It's difficult to resist a DVD that has Christopher Nolan, Al Pacino and Robin Williams to its credit. Both Memento and Following, Nolan’s earlier films, are ambiguous and experimental. On a different note, Insomnia is a psychological thriller about the murder of a teenage girl in Alaska. Before watching the film, I had prepped myself for a mind-bending experience. And I was slightly off the mark. Insomnia’s not a jigsaw puzzle. It’s a rather straightforward plot, with linear narration. But even with the simplicity, you see the layers. Once you move beyond the plot of the film, you can identify a cinematic style that provides a benchmark for his later films. Before you can start typecasting the film as a regular nail-biter, the first 15 minutes of the film introduces you to mood lighting, intercutting visuals and hallucinatory images. David Julyan’s background score is haunting and provides a sense of pace to the film. All of these elements make you think about the similarities in his directorial approach.  If you’re one of those who watched the Batman series and Inception before watching his earlier films, you’ll realize that somewhere Insomnia, becomes a stepping-stone for Nolan. It subtly marks his mysteriously layered, hair-raising style of telling a story, which is seen in abundance in his later movies. Insomnia is Nolan’s first big Hollywood film, under Warner Brothers in 2002. It’s a remake of a Norwegian film that was released in 1997 starring Stellan Skarsgard, from Good-Will Hunting. Hillary Seitz's grabbing screenplay is coupled with perfect casting. Robin Williams plays a creepy, almost psychotic writer and Al Pacino plays the battered down detective with immense conviction. You almost want to pat him to sleep every time you see him battling with Insomnia. Pacino’s character faces a moral conflict through the film which causes him to lose sleep and that’s when you notice the crafty subtext of the film. Apart from the run and chase plot, the narrative also carries with itself the motifs of defining good and evil. Nolan is known to have such characters in his film, who toe the moral lines with so much fervor, you can see yourself standing there with them. The special features on the DVD make it a valuable purchase – two commentaries, one is by director Christopher Nolan, while the other is a scene-specific affair with actress Hillary Swank, production designer Nathan Crowley, editor Dody Dorn, cinematographer Wally Pfister and screenwriter Hillary Seitz. In Nolan’s commentary, he goes through each scene as they were filmed in detail. Watch out for the 14-minute conversation with Al Pacino and Nolan where they talk about movies, filmmaking and their respective careers. The rain-drenched setting of a small town in Alaska is extremely significant. As if the silence of the town is hiding secrets of many such murders, many such instances. Pacino is brilliant, as is expected, and Insomnia makes you feel like you’re walking through the narrative, trying to figure out how Pacino manages the intelligent swiftness without any sleep.  It’s the perfect film for a lazy afternoon watch, to motivate yourself to get up and kick your senses.

They have exhausted the Germans, the Russians, the Afghans, the Italians, the East Europeans and not necessarily in that order.  So what is left?  In a post-cold-war world which is marked by increasing fundamentalist movements of all shades, there ostensibly remains only one.  That which was a good friend for so long has now turned into a deadly foe.  Ladies and Gentlemen welcome to the global Banking system as the Villain.  The International is a thriller which articulates this premise in the first few minutes.  Unfortunately, global financial manipulations and a Bank in particular do not a cinematic villain make.  One needs to have characters and faces, quirky, hateful faces if possible.  Yes, the film has the required blackguards, but none of them strike us as particularly crooked and corrupt, clothed as they are in impeccable suits and polished shoes.  Or maybe that is the point; they are just ordinary people like you and I, albeit of a different class.  They are people doing a job, like all of us, I guess.  From a cinematic viewpoint, this makes them prosaic and lifeless.  They remain props, whose role is to fill the frame and nothing else.  The film’s opening sequence is well shot with clever use of editing and sound mixing, but sadly this is not sustained thereafter.  The plot unravels as the director jumps from one scenic European location to another and we understand that some kind of global conspiracy is in motion.  Clive Owen and Naomi Watts then appear.  This heterosexual pairing is quite insipid, no chemistry, no bonding, no nothing between them, possibly again, because they are just “ordinary” people doing a job.  Well whatever the reason, thirty minutes into the movie, and one is trying to keep ennui at bay.  The only consolations are the locations, which look as if they are just what the James Bond franchise ordered.  In the first half the plot starts to get complicated, but the film manages reasonably well.  It is in the second half that it flounders. 
Tom Tykwer is the chap who helmed Run Lola Run and also Perfume.  He is known for his breakneck editing and flashy style, but this film has none of it.  There is just one magnificent action sequence set in the Guggenheim museum, which one licks one’s chops over.  But it is a classic case of too little, too late.  The rest of the film remains sluggish and produces in the viewer an extreme apathy.  Clive Owen looks dazed and confused, Naomi Watts is inanimate throughout, and the rest of the characters flit in and out.  The director was possibly trying to bridge the gap between a social comment and an action thriller, and it looks like he really could not make up his mind.  At one point, the film looks set to take off into hard core action - Hollywood style, but that does not happen.  Instead it just fizzles off into befuddled stupidity.  To make it worse, most of the dialogues at important moments seem to consist only of platitudes.  One feels depressed at the pointlessness of it all: the director has talent, he had a topical premise to work with, but the end result is strictly ho-hum.

It calls for patience and intelligence, which aren't always in ready supply. But it is also an intriguing film that makes you think. It may dazzle you, confound you or annoy you; but Nolan's latest is sure to affect you. ","Update: I watched the film again in IMAX and thought I should share my experience.Chris Nolan shot a few scenes of The Dark Knight and nearly 45 minutes of The Dark Knight Rises in the IMAX format. In Interstellar, he went a step further, with a substantial chunk of the movie being shot in the large film format that Nolan is so fond of. There's a reason for it - true IMAX, with its incredible screen size, great sound and the film projection system (not digital like the IMAX screens in other cities of India), is easily the most immersive film viewing format currently. Some shots of Interstellar, particular the space exploration parts, look absolutely stunning in IMAX. To experience all of them one after the other is humbling. Then again, with the large format, it seems some of the flaws of the film get equally amplified. Still, IMAX is definitely the format to watch the film in, even though such a small percentage of us actually have access to it.Humankind may have evolved into a greedy, complex species that is devouring our planet, with only vestiges of the once-inexhaustable thirst for knowledge that set us apart from our co-inhabitants on earth. Yet, perhaps that is the single greatest gift that we've received - curiousity, the urge to know, the tendency to seek an answer to every question we come across. We're travellers and explorers. Our journeys may be literal or figurative, (the quest to solve Fermat's Last Theorem, for instance, was also a journey,) but our inherent goal has always been just one - to go further and further into the depths of the unknown. That's all that has truly excited the human race, not routines and the mundane, decadent lifestyles we see today.Christopher Nolan's Interstellaris a journey. Not only does he take us on an unfathomable ride along with his protagonist Cooper, but he also makes us journey inwards, to seek what we don't yet know about ourselves. Yes, a crash course in physics would go a long way in making the film easier to follow, but the emotions at the heart of the film are primal. They may or may not find their way into that spot in your heart that will make them resonate with you, but that's besides the point. The question, ultimately, is about Nolan's intent.Interstellaris far richer in emotions than Nolan's previous work - so much so that the emotional core is one of the cornerstones of the film. How much the emotions touch you is a big measure of how much you're willing to move past the vagaries and ostensible foibles of the film - which appear to be many.Set in the distant future, where Earth seems incapable of being a viable home for humanity for much longer, NASA recruits a former astronaut to lead a mission into space, to find an alternate home to ensure the continued survival of our species. The problems of space and time - the biggest hurdles in accessing the outer reaches of our universe - are solved by a curious wormhole.    Nolan doesn't thrust the science upon us right away. We begin by observing the state of the world, through the eyes of Cooper and his family. We see the relationship he has with his children - particularly with his daughter. Nolan, like most filmmakers, uses his characters to voice his own thoughts often, so it's interesting to see Cooper encourage his children to also question and analyze. The space travel and exploration aspects, though obviously forming the bulk of the film, begin much later. It is here that some knowledge of the physics that the film references would be of immense use in following the events that occur. Relativity, wormholes, black holes, gravity, the works - for those whom all of this is alien and incomprehensible, the film will only be a plodding, indulgent mystery. The deeper the understanding of the physics in question, the more gripping the film becomes.Through it all, the overarching presence of love never leaves. Love, it seems, transcends both space and time, almost holding the cosmos together. Nolan isn't particularly adept at filming drama, so the film's weakest moments are when characters stop to talk about love or to express it. The scenes are earnest, but a tad bit awkward. The film's most jaw-dropping moments are bang in the midst of the space exploration, where some of Hoyte van Hoytema's magnificent frames are a spectacle to behold.   Chris Nolan's most well-known trope - his penchant for the non-linear narrative - once again forms the backbone of the film. Except, this time because he's playing with dimensions higher than those to which our earthly presences are bound, there is likely to be more than the usual amount of confusion about exactly what happened and when. The film warrants repeat viewings, quite like every other film in his filmography.Hans Zimmer always seems to set aside something special for Chris Nolan, and this time is no different. The music score of Interstellaris a hypnotic masterwork - what it lacks in variation, it makes up for in sheer ambition. In fact, the sound design of the film overall plays a huge role in gnawing at your attention. The use of silence in space, particularly in the face of the rapturous visual grandeur on display, is humbling.The film's biggest weakness is its runtime. At nearly 3 hours, it can be a test of patience for those who switch off at melodrama or science. However, for those who don't have a problem with either, every minute of the film is a treat, because there's always something happening. Everything is connected, everything has meaning, nothing is there just because of a whim of a sagacious filmmaker.Interstellarwas shot in the IMAX format, which is quite different in size and aspect ratio to the regular 35mm Cinemascope that we're used to. So obviously, the film is best watched in the largest screen one can find (the IMAX screen in Hyderabad for instance; the only true IMAX in the country). But the scale of the visuals is trumped by the scale of Chris Nolan's vision, so Interstellarwill make for an out-of-the-ordinary phenomenon on any screen. Some of humanity's greatest achievements have been finding the answers to questions that confounded generations, and these answers came as a reward after many moons of toil. Patience, it seems, is always rewarding. Interstellaris quite like that. As it twists around time, space and everything in between, it rewards you for patience, attention and curiosity. It also serves a measure of these for each individual, because like all of cinema, Interstellarisn't for everyone.

455,553,553,553,553,Investment,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/investment-review/,,,,3.333333333,"Veteran Marathi playwright and director Ratnakar Matkari's debut film Investment holds strong vestiges of his theatre background. The characters and the performances overshadow the message that the film is trying to get across, in a manner that is often detrimental to the film itself. Thus, despite having its heart in the right place, the film comes across as being far too theatrical.","Acclaimed playwright and theatre director, Ratnakar Matkari makes his feature film debut at the age of 74 with his film Investment, which premiered at the 14th Mumbai Film Festival, in the India Gold category for Indian premieres in competition. A film that largely remains theatrical because of the way in which the characters and scenes have been treated, I often found myself wondering exactly what the selection panel saw in the film for them to shortlist it as a finalist in the competition.The film tells the story of Ashish and Prachi, a young couple who have lofty ambitions of speeding through Maslow's hierarchy of needs even if the cost of it is losing their grounding and values. They have even higher ambitions for their adolescent boy Sohel, who they hope to groom and nurture into a politician in the future. Sohel's paternal grandmother tries her best to instill values in the child, who is an absolute brat, but she begins to see that in a world where everything is about how much you have and who you know, she seems to be fighting a losing battle. With the parents spoiling their child endlessly, along with their own aspirations of moving into a higher class of society, an incident in their lives shakes them from their roots.There isn't a doubt about the fact that Ratnakar Matkari's intentions are noble. We indeed do live in a world where material worth and social circles carry far more weight than one's innate character. Money can buy you almost anything, and with the exposure that today's children have to the explosion of media and information around them, there is a very real threat that in the not-too-distant future, society will cease to believe in the very concepts of right and wrong. Ratnakar Matkari has dealt with these very issues in his film, through the characters of Ashish, Prachi and Sohel. The film's undoing lies in the fact that he has treated it with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the audience's head.Ashish is the 'cool' dad who, as Prachi tells her mother-in-law in the film, is more his son's friend than his father, as is the 'norm' in society today. Prachi herself is gloriously theatrical while executing her unashamed ambitions, planning her family's rise in society with the machinations of a Shakespearean manipulator. Sohel is an annoying brat who has his way with his parents at all times, getting only fond looks and expensive gifts for his unbearably obnoxious behaviour. These characters have been painted with such broad strokes that they almost stand out as caricatures. In spite of having a competent cast with names like Tushar Dalvi and Sulbha Deshpande, the performances of the cast are over-the-top, which contributes to the film seeming even more theatrical.For this story to succeed cinematically, it needed a far more subtle approach. The characters, which no doubt are rooted in the real, end up seeming unreal because of the treatment. Also, even technically, the camerawork makes it seem more like a filmed play than anything else. The screenplay itself is rather loose and begins bordering on the inane towards the latter half of the film. Investment thus ends up being a little like a Madhur Bhandarkar film albeit with a cleaner, more relevant subject. It might work as a weekend afternoon TV watch and those who subscribe to the rather strong stereotypes of the characters in the film might even enjoy it. But for most, the film's extremes will make it a tedious watch.

However, if you don't know about the scam close to what's really happening in Punjab's sarso-de-khet1, you might want a peep in. ","On the one hand, yet again you have the common man finding himself stuck in the web of greed for power and money by the business-politics-law-order nexus. On the other hand you have yet another scary scam. On the one hand you have a scary scam you might not have heard of. On the other hand you have the regular story of a frustrated and disappointed common man taking on the system. Repeatedly, you may weigh one against the other but the Singham-usque take pulls the film down even as the scam, which brings a shudder down the spine, tries to pull it up. You cannot doubt the sincerity with which the writer/director take a shot at the issue of ground-chemical-induced cancer. It is one of those scams that you vaguely know of, but don't know the extent to which industry and agricultural pesticides have taken root. In fact, as Arjun Mishra (Arshad Warsi) is shaken up by events he unveils, you are too. Because you know this inhumanity is not fiction.The details though aren't entertained. Many plot points seem like convenient ways to push the drama to the two-hour mark of run-time. An instance of a person murdering someone on their own side rather than the ones in the opposition left me puzzled. Then there is some mumbo-jumbo about a secret chemical formula, the importance of which was unclear. These bits take away from the impact that the film could have had and make it seem long-drawn for a 110 minute film.Fortunately, we have performers who rarely let us down. Even, Rajesh Sharma who is usually made to ham and go over-the-top, delivers a relatively controlled performance. The film's digs at Bollywood's over-romanticisation of all things Punjab and all things idealistic too. But, then again it submits to the formula – a one-man stand against the system – that's the only solution we can seem to think of, even as we speak of issues that exist in real-life. But, I guess, there are no better ideas out there and this one seems to sell. Anyway, the one reason to look this one up is to get a peep into the eco-terrorism supposedly rampant in Punjab and hope against hope that it is only in Punjab. 1 The lush green-and-yellow mustard farms that Punjab is famous for and romanticised by popular Hindi films.

457,555,555,555,555,[The] Iron Lady,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/iron-lady-review/,,5/5.0,,2.966666667,"The Iron Lady stands more as a celebration of Meryl Streep, arguably one of the finest actors we have today. She acts with her eyes, whether she plays an old woman distraught with dementia, or a powerful, long-standing politician. As a biopic, however, the film falls flat without a tone or a message. It’s a mere play of facts with no binding thread. Watch the film for Streep alone. ","Ever since I saw the trailer of The Iron Lady, I couldn’t imagine anyone else but Meryl Streep play Margaret Thatcher. In my head, with whatever little knowledge I had about the politician, I thought it was brilliant casting, to get someone as able as Streep to play an ambivalent character as hers. This thought stayed with me after I walked out of watching the film. I struggled to place Thatcher’s real face. All I could think of, was this one shot of Streep as Thatcher with her husband Denis Thatcher (played by Jim Broadbent), as they stand behind a podium, dressed in blue, with their hands held up together in victory. Streep sold me the visual picture. Using flashbacks as its main narrative device, The Iron Lady traces Thatcher’s journey from an unknown British woman who went to oxford, and slowly, through the course of her marriage and twins, finds her way into politics. We whisk through her accomplishments, through a series of montages. We also periodically keep intercutting to the present day, where we see an older Thatcher, battling with dementia, as she has make-believe conversations. We are shown flashbacks of her courtship days with her husband, and archival footage of the British political past. It’s a slow progression however; one that not necessarily follows a particular motif.The biggest problem with The Iron Lady is the absence of direction of the script. The film attempts to capture all of Thatcher’s life in 2 hours, but as is the case with every biopic, a flavour is necessary; or what is popularly known as a peg. We are shown her involvements in major historical events (A war in Argentina, her invasion of the Falkland Islands, etc). But it goes wrong in its flat, lifeless portrayal. The graph of her political career would have been more interesting had we been shown the impact of her professional accomplishments on her psyche, her loved and mostly on her rivals. No other character has been paid attention to, while Streep gives the performance of the year. While Jim Broadbent as Dennis Thatcher is gripping, Streep is the clear show-stealer. She takes on the voice, accent, demeanor, and powerful-eyes of Thatcher – this film has nothing else going for itself. She captures the confusion and nuances of a person suffering from dementia perfectly, and you’re able to sit up in awe when this is intercut with glimpses of her longstanding political career.The Iron Lady would have been a much more impactful film has the script managed to hold our interest. Instead, we end up getting confused about the tone of the film, and the message it wants to convey. It is merely a document of dull facts being played out one after another, and the use of flashbacks have not been justified. Was the Oscar worth it, is a question that this film cannot answer. Streep has given a powerful performance, but because the film doesn’t bind it together – I personally prefer her in The Devil Wears Prada. Watch The Iron Lady for Meryl Streep alone, though if you miss this one, you won’t really be missing anything.

458,556,556,556,556,Iron Man 3,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/iron-man-3-review/,,5/5.0,,2.966666667,"The third film in the Iron Man franchise, directed by Shane Black this time, is easily the best in the series. Robert Downey Jr is at his best, the action scenes are terrific in scale, vision and execution, and Ben Kingsley’s The Mandarin makes for one of the most enigmatic screen villains ever. Good, big screen fun, this.","You’d think that the best thing about the DVD of a movie that’s as fun as Iron Man 3 would be the film itself. Well, if you did think that, you’d be forgiven for being a little wrong.An 8-minute bonus featurette titled ‘Deconstructing the Scene: Attack on Air Force One’ shows the making of one of the most thrilling set pieces from the film, and believe you me, the making of that scene will blow you away even more than the scene itself. A true victory of production and VFX, it reminds you just why movies can be so magical. How one wishes though, that Shane Black had made a consequential appearance in this featurette, to provide some more insights on how the director sees such a scene.The DVD also has another interesting bonus feature – a minute-and-a-half behind the scenes sneak peak at Thor: The Dark World, which releases in November 2013. The clip does make you look forward to it.Then there’s the film itself, which makes for as fun a DVD watch as it was on the big screen. As is the norm these days, all of it is packed into a single disc; one that sadly has no subtitles or language options in any regional Indian language.One small touch that Iron Man fans might enjoy is the fact that the DVD Menu loads with an intro by Jarvis, Iron Man’s AI sidekick (for want of another word.)In that epic climactic conversation scene in Kill Bill Volume 2, one of Quentin Tarantino’s masterstrokes was Bill explaining the Superman mythology to The Bride; he says that, unlike other superheroes who wear a costume and become ‘super’, Superman is exactly who he is. Superman. Clark Kent is the disguise; that’s his costume. While what Tarantino said about Superman makes perfect sense, when it comes to what he said about the other superheroes, I will, for once, differ with the man. We are all are known by the choices we make; all the superheroes we love, be it from the Marvel universe or the DC universe, discovered immense power that they chose to channel in a heroic manner. And the moment they made that choice, they became the superhero. So, what is true about Superman, is actually true about the others as well. It is, quite simply, the fundamental truth that lies at the core of every superhero story. Batman is always Batman; Bruce Wayne is the costume. No superhero film, for me, has explored this fundamental facet of the superhero mythology quite like Iron Man 3 does. There may be many Iron Man suits, which anyone can wear, but there is only one Iron Man. The film also carries the message that the biggest bit of heroism is perhaps defeating the demons within. But, to heck with messages really. Iron Man 3 is, above all, smashing good fun.The story of Iron Man 3 is set post the events that occurred in The Avengers, which was released exactly this time last year. Iron Man, if you remember, passed through a portal into another dimension and back before crashing to the ground in a freefall. Since then, Tony Stark hasn’t been the same. This time around, he also has to contend with an obscure, secretive villain known only as The Mandarin, who is responsible for a series of mysterious bomb blasts around the globe.The film does have a bit of a slow build up, but once it gets full throttle, it can only be described as an audio-visual spectacle. Thrilling action set pieces, peppered with Tony Stark’s acerbic wit all through, along with a number of superb supporting performances make the film a rollicking ride alright. It still isn’t nearly as much fun as The Avengers, but it is quite easily the best Iron Man film so far.Big credit for that must definitely go to Shane Black, who directs the franchise for the first time, after Jon Favreau directed the first two installments. In fact, this is Shane Black’s first feature since the insanely clever Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (also starring Robert Downey Jr) way back in 2005, and only his second feature film as director. Huge jump in terms of scale, especially considering the eight year gap, but Black does full justice to it. The Iron Man – Tony Stark relationship feels so much more intense, and yet so much more comfortable, I suspect, due to the touch brought in by Black. But then. Robert Downey Jr is Tony Stark. Who is Iron Man. You can’t say either Tony Stark or Iron Man without picturing Robert Downey Jr as the man who is the face and the voice of the character. His electric presence, his spontaneity and the sheer physical character makes Iron Man the thrilling cinematic superhero that he is. Never have egotism and self-aggrandizing humour looked so good on screen. Robert Downey Jr is one of the finest mainstream male lead actors in the world, and watching him is always a joy. Shockingly enough, it is possible for someone to steal scenes even from under Robert Downey Jr’s nose. And, to do that, who better than Sir Ben Kingsley? Though he has very little screen time, this is the kind of character and performance that an actor should die for. The Mandarin becomes one of the most enigmatic and memorable villains ever because of what perhaps no other actor could bring to the table; you see, acting twice is harder than acting once. (That’s me trying to be as enigmatic as The Mandarin. Wink.) Guy Pearce, who also joins the franchise for the first time as Aldrich Killian, the super-scientist with a secret, is superb as well. So are franchise regulars Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow as Col James Rhodes and Pepper Potts, respectively.  I watched the film in IMAX 3D, which no doubt added to the experience of watching some of the best-executed action scenes you’ll see. Otherwise, I don’t think watching it in 3D is mandatory; I’m sure the film will be good fun in 2D as well. For some phenomenal acting, great action and for those goosebumps you’ll undoubtedly get every single time Tony Stark becomes Iron Man, the film is a must watch. Submit yourself to Tony Stark’s world; you’ll have a good time, I promise.PS – Stay right until the end of the final credit roll for a fun little Easter Egg!

While watching it you’ll feel like a little boy, who’s been thrusted with a camera and exposed to the realities of life, so to say. It might not be entirely realistic, but the treatment of the film will make you feel like a child, it’ll make you feel raw and vulnerable. It’s a difficult film – watch it only if you can sit through films like that.","Whatever you’ve heard about Gasper Noe’s Irreversible is true. It is disturbing, graphic and brutal, and definitely not a film that everyone can watch. Maybe that is one of the reasons I wanted to watch the film. Not entirely because of a rebellious streak, but because I remember reading a review about the film long ago that said it shouldn’t be seen by women. I don’t know if I wanted to make a point or just see what the big deal was with Irreversible, but regardless, there is no denying it is a painful watch, for more reasons than one.Irreversible is told in a reverse narrative, about a couple, Alex (Monca Bellucci) and Marcus (Vincent Cassel) who head out on a regular evening to a party. The movie follows Marcus and Alex’s ex Pierre (Albert Dupontel), through a route of revenge for a brutal act against Alex. There are sickening bouts of violence and sexual explicitness through the film, the intention of which seems fairly clear on the director’s part. The idea is to make the viewer feel extremely uncomfortable, with swirling, shaky camera movements and jarring, low frequency sounds that dominate the first thirty minutes of the film. Purposed achieved, except what remains unclear is how the fundamental plot of the film justifies this treatment. It’s as if Noe decided he wanted to bully his audience, with the experimentation portrayed in Irreversible, barring the fact that hand-held and shaky camera movements are hardly experimental these days. This might be a purist thought, but if a filmmaker decides to use certain experimental techniques in his film, shouldn’t the basic story of the film have some sort of connect to it? As a viewer you can deduce why Memento used a non-linear technique, to explain the complexities of the situation involving Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce). Lars Von Trier’s Antichrist also has a reputation of being graphic, but after a viewing you can understand that it’s a part of the personalities of the lead characters. With Irreversible, however, one feels like Noe wanted to make a film involving sexual explicitness, extreme violence and wanted to experiment with camera and sound – so he chose the first basic story that came to his mind. Irreversible is technically meticulous, no doubt. The overall feel is like the camera’s been handed to an omniscient bystander, who has no control of it. The film seems like it’s been taken in one shot, the cuts are cleverly included at correct points. He’s played around with the idea of time, in terms of narrative structure and thought provoking dialogue – but again the question of relevance comes in. Somehow, at the end of the film you don’t feel like the reverse narrative is justified – perhaps it’s because the climax, even though a revelation, doesn’t match to the build up of the narrative. The official DVD has a couple of basic features like the director’s commentary and an interview with Belluci about the film. But the star attraction of the DVD is definitely a making of the violent and sexual scenes – how certain tricks were used and the invisible cuts were planned. In its defense, Irreversible does hold a certain vision of emotions gone wild, and that being translated into a visual experience. Maybe the treatment is faulty, and there might be some viewers out there who’d appreciate blurry, seemingly Avant Garde feel of the film, or maybe I’ve missed the point entirely. Nonetheless, Irreversible is a hard film; surely one to extract an extreme emotion out of you. Whether you’re a man or a woman, be warned before you watch it.

Sometimes the pathos is overwhelming enough to make you ignore everything else that's wrong with the story. At other times though, it could be an Ishaqzaade which isn't sure about how it wants the audience to react to its characters and thus comes across as confused. Add to that a stretched out, predictable  climax and you have an uneasy, restless audience.The first scene introduces Parmar (Arjun Kapoor) as a ruthless, uncouth brat who the audience will very unwillingly call an anti-hero, let alone hero. And no, right to the end, you cannot warm up to his character; empathizing or rooting for his cause is a distant thought. But that also says two things complimentary about the content - Parmar does nothing out of character and is consistent; Arjun Kapoor plays Parmar to perfection because the feeling of disgust towards the character never leaves you. Exactly the same things can be said about Zoya and Parineeti Chopra the actor who plays Zoya. Zoya is consistently immature and ironically feminine as far as emotion goes, behind all the macho bravado.  In fact, Zoya is likable despite this inconsistency because life is a thrill ride for her and death is equally adventurous too. This charm seeps through and that has a lot to do with Parineeti Chopra's refreshing attitude towards being a lead lady in a Hindi film. Unfortunate as it is, none of this translates into a story that can sustain your interest for over two hours. Ishaqzaade reminded me that ""predicable"" doesn't just mean the audience guessing exactly what will happen. A story is predicable and a tad more frustratingly so, when the audience guesses two (or more) possible outcomes of a particular situation and both (or all) seem equally done to death. You could do all of this in style have good camera work and sense of aesthetics but the lack of content is transparent. The dialogues lack the charm of Habib Faisal's debut Do Dooni Chaar. The references - to a woman's place in Indian society, be it a strong-headed girl or a righteous widow, and similar impotence of a man who does whatever it takes because he seeks approval of his role model - are very interesting but do little to how lame the plot is as it culminates. Social message at the end, notwithstanding.A love story is a love story is a love story. And actually, we expect very little from it, in terms of being different. What we want is to engage with our Romeos  and Juliets, we want to feel that a Majnu should unite with his Laila, in this world or beyond. But in Ishaqzaade, you aren't even sure Ranjha deserves Heer. Amidst the endless gun shots, you are hoping for a gun or two to go with the cliche and run out of bullets, so there is some sight of 'The End'.

What amazes me is why anyone would want to tell it again, when there aren't any takers for listening to it.","You meet someone. You become friends. You enjoy each other's company. You hate same things together. You fall in love. You begin to hate each other. Then, either you get back together or you don't. Ishkq in Paris is drabber in telling you this story than the way I've narrated it. Ishkq (Preity Zinta) - yes, that's the characters name! - and Akaash (Rhehan Malliek) go through the mechanics so clinically, that it feels all but real.And aren't love stories about making the unreal feel real. Just having a dialogue that says, ""This is a true love story."" doesn't make it one. Nor do lines like ""I love Bollywood."" and ""I love Paris"" make us believe that you do, they only make the words ""I love you"" sound like it was said because the writers couldn't think of other ways to express it. Preity Zinta and Rhehan Malliek do try their best to infuse life into the lines. But, that's the problem, their effort shows. That besides there is no relief from them. There are long scenes with them talking to each other. The only breather comes when Ishkq's mom Marie (Isabelle Adjani) is on screen, and then you wish you hadn't wished to see other faces. There are no 'aawww' moments, zero funny ones and lots of times when the film tries to be superficially cool with all its talk about ex-boyfriends and no marriages and so on. It does to try touch upon the deep insecurities of the lady protagonist, but turns into the age old, ""damsel in distress"" protocol. You really wonder what made Preity Zinta produce this one? Except for the line she says out loud in the film, ""So what, if we can't watch a film, no one can stop us from making one.""

Yeah, Ishqiya is one of those films that leaves with you that feeling. Once you believe in the story, its well told. But even after the plot has unfolded there's a huge gap in understanding the characters. ","I feel like this unappeasable audience who demands more and more from her movie-makers. I constantly complain about one-dimensional characters. Ishqiya has three reasonably well-defined characters with very visible shades of gray and yet it doesn't give a ""complete"" feeling when walking out of the theater. The film is made well technically too. The interaction amongst the characters takes a hit in this one, and it is difficult to understand the motivations of their behavior.After an intriguing start, mid-way, the film completely changes its tone. This leaves you disconcerted. Sure, a lot about the characters is intentionally mysterious, but as we approach the climax, shouldn't there be at least a vaguely interpretable rationale. It doesn't even have the artsy, take-your-own-guess kind-of an appeal. It looks more like lazy writing. Khaalu-jaan (Naseeruddin Shah) is a romantic who can kill, if he wants to. Babban (Arshad Warsi) is a thug who falls in love. Both are rugged, men of the soil. Krishna (Vidya Balan) is a romantic who maintains a constant enigma about her. She's absolutely convincing as a seductress who knows what she wants (whether or not we figure it out). Once the chemistry between them is established it is awesome and the actors have done a wonderful job. But, why the chemistry happens in the first place, has no answers. Also, a lot of this is because you don't have any background about the setting of the film. It is either assumed that you know what happens socially and politically, in and around Gorakhpur or you are given a feeling that it is not supposed to matter. Since I don't know why the Yadavs are fighting the Thakurs, there was a huge gap in the dynamics of the various side characters. And yet there is a lot going on by means of entertainment and keeping you interested. The spontaneous dialogues delivered with perfect timing. The twisted plot is engaging - so what if it geared towards a lame and dissatisfying end. Also, the propriety and plausibility of Krishna's behavior are a huge question mark. ""Executing a nice story well,"" is not an easy feat. With a unmissable Vishal Bharadwaj feel to the way the story is told, it is lyrical and earthy. But the story is kind-of warped and leaves a distinct taste of discontent. p.s. I wish a movie could be given a higher rating for awesome music. All songs, except for 'Ibn-e-batuta' are exceptional - brilliant music and lyrics to top that.

A film made just like it was made 20 years ago. From the mannerisms of the actors to the texture of the film - everything is a reminiscence of the eighty's. It's still all in one lifetime, I guess that's the production house's excuse. There's still something so innocent about the film that it would have been likable if it were 45 minutes and a few sermons shorter.","You can see how Rajshri Productions is struggling to keep up with the times. They are trying hard to catch up with the generation that is absolutely comfortable with the use of the f-word and the s-word. But their discomfort is transparent because they want to stick to their kind of cinema. This time around, their solution to the clash of the generations is mutual respect. A back-answering rebellious youth is told to age a little quicker and look at it from an older person's point of view. The more experienced, thus wiser are applauded when they give their children a chance at living life king size. All this might be possible without lectures (no filmmakers, masking them as songs doesn't make them any less patronizing) and ""tubelight""  moments turned into dramatic realizations. But not in the Barjatya world. Their characters are saccharine-cute and coy even as they are reborn into more glamorized, more ""modern"" avatars. Rajnandini, the protagonist transforms into RJ, but where will the sweetness that she is born with go? These sugar-coated, wordless (spineless?) girls do exist. Hell, yours truly, this marwadi, ""city-girl"" might have given a cousin or two a run for her money, when it came to blind obedience. I even did the dreadful CA! I wouldn't be surprised if we found a specimen or two like me even today. That is why I think Isi Life Mein doesn't work at all. It was so easy for me to identify with mute Rajnandini, but I didn't. Sandeepa Dhar, who plays Rajnandini, has a lovely chemistry with Akshay Oberoi too. But the narrative just falls flat. There is no pique point. When characters are subdued and willing to take life lying down, there is only so much the audience can root for. Sure, it happens in real life, but then again, that real life is boring too. The only points of interest are the choreographed pieces of the improvised The Taming of the Shrew. The college romance was cute but it didn't grow on me.A misfit in the 00s despite being relevant, Isi Life Mein is as much an irony as it is a shame. How I wish someone could add more spunk to the subject and bring it on yet again.

Oh dear...","When you walk out of a film, whether or not you like it, you come out with a sense of what the film was about, what it wanted to say or do. That it succeeded or failed for you, in the way it was narrated, is a different matter. Issaq doesn't give you the chance to assess the latter bit. You just are left wondering what it was all about. Is it a love story with a backdrop of politics? Is it a family feud? Is it about Maoists? You'd believe it most if you someone said it wasn't about anything at all.When a film is about something, it makes the ""something"" an innate part of its narrative. At the very least, In a romance, you'd feel like rooting for the couple. Instead, the crowd cheered when bad things happened to them, and not because they had grey shades in them. For me, it was worse, I was indifferent to what happened to them.You have no clue why Rahul (Prateik Babbar) )and Bachchi (Amyra Dastur) are in love with each other. You don't know where their loyalties lie. Every time you feel you know what their next step will be, they do the exact opposite of what their character has been saying. That's not really the right kind of unpredictability. You just don't feel anything for them at all.To top it off, there is barely any chemistry between the two actors. Prateik Babbar's dialogue delivery is at its worst. The pauses he takes in the sentence make you feel like you are watching a primary school play. Amyra Dastur, in comparison, seems like an ace-rate performer, which she really isn't. Except for one scene which has her read out poetry, which she does a great job of, her performance doesn't get your attention at all. Unfortunately, this scene seems rather out of context and the performance is wasted in the context of the film.Similarly, a lot of things feel out of context. While it was disorienting enough to have South Indian Maoists in Varanasi, that they were portrayed as psychopaths and/or terrorists bothered me more. There was a disconcerting randomness about who they chose to kill. Prashant Narayanan, as the character who plays their leader, could walk through this one in his sleep. So, yeah, the film wasn't remotely about Maoism either.That leaves the political angle which is the funniest bit. You know more about Tittas (Ravi Kissen) the lover than the supposedly political sidekick that he is. You know even lesser about the two gangster-politicians  who you are asked to fear at the very beginning of the film. However, you are given nothing at all to fear them. In fact, more than once, they come across as meek, disable men.When all else fails, you usually have something in the technical departments to keep you going. The music, the dances, the action. No hope here, either. All you are left with is, one botched up scene after the other. In fact, the entire film, quite literally looks like, scenes were shot and sewn together in pretty much random order. For example, it felt like they had Prateik Babbar jump roof tops just so there could be an action element in the film. Oh well! Not that the world was expected from Issaq, so it's not like you come back disappointed. You just feel sad for the people who claim to take Romeo and Juliet to Varanasi.

Especially when the lead ladies stand up to the tall task. Unfortunately though every once in a while the script digresses into a subplot and thus loses focus.,"It’s really exciting that new things are being tried. One obvious by-product of the process is that good directors, actors, music composers, lyricists are getting the visibility they deserve. Even if this particular movie is not necessarily the best cinema produced, it is just refreshing because of the subject matter chosen. Scripts revolving around women deserve brownie points anyway. Why? Because they are bound to be different considering there are such few made. This script, like many others, addresses the problems of the “system” that runs the country. The contemporary touch that it gives the context makes it a gripping watch. Unfortunately a great chance to have insightful dialogues is lost. And it's not like the silences are used well. Also, ultimately, it is a message movie. But, the message seems to be geared towards the media. How many takers are there for a message that specific?Also, there are digressions. One sub-plot used to establish the tone of the movie is too long. And another one, though necessary, is too rushed. Other minor digressions could have been entirely avoided (e.g., those alluding to characters' love lives). Also, there were a couple loose ends that either should have been entirely left out, or should have been given closure.Koena Puri and Swati Sen are brilliant actors and it would be a shame if they don’t get such meaty characters to play in the future too. Swati shook me from within, in one of the scenes. The other actors are at best average. Most of them had monotonous, lifeless dialogue delivery.Though the music isn't extraordinary, the lyrics are awesome. And, the background score breaking into ""It's breaking news"" is a nag.Unfortunately, outstanding acting by the lead ladies will not be enough to cover the flaws in the details of the script. And this is despite an overall interesting plot. How I wish, it was marketed a little better, so at least a few more people would know about it.

Other than that Entertainment is as Akshay Kumar a film as it gets. ,"For about half the film, various characters go about saying, ""I want to kill entertainment,"" Entertainment being the name of a character. But, taking cue from the film's extensive use of pun, you can say that the makers succeeded on that mission statement. There are reasonable attempts at keeping the humor ""different"", but nowhere close to good enough.The film starts out with making fun of obese people and man-boobs. So, you know how sensitive the film is going to be from the word go. Except, that it becomes about love animals and then you know, you should take the film even less seriously than usual. No, not because animal-love is not serious business. But because how can someone who is oblivious to the worthiness of other groups of people - women, for example, be taken seriously when they talk about some other social issue. Even so, the film just might strike a chord amongst animal-lovers just because of the dearth of Hindi films in that category. But, that's just about it. For all other purposes it is like a Moral Science lesson for class 2, the saving grace being it is not an animated film. Not necessarily, preachy, but melo-dramatic enough to turn you off, even before you can let the lesson reach out to you. The evil in you is overturned by the goodness of another, this theme has been beaten down to death in Hindi films. More often than not it comes after a few leaps of faith and more from the audience. Entertainment has almost every character turn over in this manner and is far away from being digestible. Not that that is what the writers were aiming for. Their aim, then, seems to be two-fold. One - to awaken within you, the love for animals and two - to make you laugh. With the first one, I doubt they made any new converts, but I am sure animal-lovers got a lot of ""aawwww"" moments out of it. For a change, I didn't mind the attempt at humor, at some places. Not that it made me laugh too hard, but after exhausting every phrase in which the word dog is used and setting aside a couple of innuendoes, juvenile SMS forwards, toilet jokes and self-referencing puns, there was a genuine attempt at being different. They didn't resort to repeating the same joke over and over again to kill it. Each character was specifically given a certain type of gag-line and there were various analogies, or for want of a better word - verticals that the gag-line took. So, while one character uses names of celebrities instead of words that sound like their name another calls people's bluff when they threaten him using puns related to the threat. As one would expect, this becomes repetitive, but less so than it had potential to.The only thing to be said about the performances is that Tamannaah Bhatia looked the best of the lot. This is despite Sonu Sood and Prakash Raj playing villains. Enough said. Also, the lesser we talk about the plot (complete with logical jumps at regular intervals) though, the better it would be. There is only so much one can say about a father wanting a rich husband for his daughter and the husband-to-be adopting any means to achieve that - including, a competition with a dog, for what the dog owns (yes, ""the dog owns""). I tried to draw various metaphors for the way in which the word Entertainment was used. Unfortunately, the only one that made sense was the one which involved the murder of entertainment.

","The most important part of a thriller is how the audience comes to know whodunnit. The actual character who did it or why they did what they did is secondary. Many thrillers cop out on the how by a character narrating how it all happened. There is no unraveling only a summarised monologue of a revelation. When that happens, the build-up seems like a tool to keep your attention rather than to get you thinking and involved. If you haven’t guessed it yet, Ittefaq does exactly that. A rich thriller story which could have been enhanced in its telling is let down by the way it executes the crux.Other than that Ittefaq has the usual murder-mystery aura about it. Through flashbacks, the accusation passes from one suspect to another and back as fast as a parcel does the rounds in a game of passing the parcel. When it stops, the game slows down. While each flashback builds the story, the present time sequences mostly have the suspects saying they didn’t do it – which they have been doing a lot of, on their real-life Twitter accounts too. These scenes also have extraneous elements such as a flickering tubelight or the investigating officer, Dev’s home and wife. In hindsight these seem like fillers to extend the run-time. It would have helped if the clues in the investigation in present-time didn’t come about so easily in the first half. Interestingly, Dev is introduced as this smug investigating officer who just knows where to look for evidence. Later in the film though, he turns into a cop who happens to remember evidence because of what he is doing perchance and reaches new conclusions. No slick deductive skills there. The CSI/Dexter-esque analysis seems like an afterthought. Then there are the logical questions like, why is the interrogation in piecemeal in the first place? Wouldn’t the officers get the whole story out in one sitting? Had the story moved forward more in the non-flashback parts of the film, the film would have felt less like a drag. For a film that is less than 2 hours, Ittefaq spends a fair amount of time lingering – and not in a good way. The tone is set by the chase sequence that the film begins with. It goes on for over five minutes and nothing additional is being told to you in those introductory scenes. If at all, it focuses on a police officer who snoozes and takes pleasure in scaring suspects and witnesses alike – and he is not even one of the main characters of the film! A fair amount of time is also spent on  dry humor. A thriller usually uses humour to relieve you from the intensity of the suspense. Here though the mystery doesn’t build up enough and the humour ends up deviating from the little thrill. I was also distracted by the continuity in lighting. Usually in such cases, I don’t let the technical aspects of film-making bother me, but Ittefaq’s indecisiveness about whether it is night and day was too difficult to ignore. A scene that looks like it is day-time is interspersed between scenes of the same night. No, this wasn’t an attempt at non-linearity. What keeps you interested is actually the hope of a mind-bending twist, which unfortunately doesn’t come about. On the other hand, except for the title, I’m glad Ittefaq doesn’t fall for the other crime that thrillers are usually guilty of – intentionally misleading the audience. Also thankfully, the performances even if not the greatest, aren’t distracting either. Siddharth Malhotra does well to keep his expressions ambiguous. If you believe he is not guilty, you will see innocence. If you believe he is guilty, you will see a hidden smirk. Sonakshi Sinha too does well to don completely different avatars in the two versions of the story. Akshaye Khanna anchors the film with a monotonous expression, but that is attributable to the writing. A thriller that attempts to be tight ought to have minimal role for side characters, but Ittefaq gives them too much room. Due to no fault of theirs, this invasion got me annoyed at the actors. I submit I am equally annoyed at not being brought to the edge-of-my-seat. I didn’t see myself taking sides and swaying with the alternating narratives. And the worst of it all, at the end, I felt like I was at a screenplay narration and not at the screening of a chilling narrative.

As Hoover, DiCaprio is fascinating and the immensely gripping, well-researched portrayal of this powerful public figure makes J Edgar a must watch. ","If you compare the black and white picture of J Edgar Hoover and Leonardo DiCaprio, you’ll see just how shockingly different they look from one another. So when I learned that the latter was playing Hoover in Eastwood’s next film, I felt a wave of anticipation. Having enough faith in the politically meaty character of Hoover, Eastwood’s ability to bring to the table a perspective (in a biopic) that might be least expected and Leonardo DiCaprio’s stellar dedication to give his best performance and raise the bar with every film – I walked out of the film knowing my faith has been keptA biopic on one the most contributive head of the Bureau of Investigation, J Edgar is a subtly paced, psychologically underlined film. During his tenure as the head (he’s also responsible for adding the term Federal to the FBI); he worked around 8 presidents, who feared him as he kept secret files on almost every public figure. He in turn, feared his  mother (Judi Dench), who is quite strong with her words and, through whom the politics of his sexuality is best surrounded. She believed, “I’d rather have a dead son, than a daffodil for a son”, and it could be for this reason that his homosexuality was always closeted. This fact however, is never openly discussed in the film, and only beautifully hinted at in a passing manner. He also shares screen space with another woman, FBI secretary Helen Gandy ( Naomi Watts ). They share a first date when he decides that marriage would be beneficial for him.   Watts ’ subtle performance as his life-long secretary is notable. Rumored to be in a homosexual relationship with his associate and lifelong friend, Clyde Tolson, his public image disallowed any homosexual man (or black men and any woman) to become FBI agents.  Eastwood ’s film mostly captures this public portrayal. In true Eastwood  style, the 81-year old auteur marks his stamp on the film by moving through his ferocious decline as a public figure via 2 main time periods: 1920s and 30s when he was establishing himself and the late 60s when he recounts his life while transcribing his memoirs. The latter part of the film easily captures  DiCaprio’s finer performance. It’s quivering yet controlled and dominant. You can tell that Eastwood isn’t a big fan of Hoover, having stripped down the character to its hypocrisies and insecurities. However, the magnanimous picture that he puts forward of the tumultuous life of J Edgar Hoover makes you realize that it’s his public mask that Eastwood admired most: the overriding, authoritative and narcissistic head of the FBI. The film’s back-and-forth narrative lacks punch in some parts, as the Lindbergh Kidnapping case and the John Dillenger case unfolds. You wish the otherwise repressive relationship between Tolson and him could have been explored more, but in many post-movie interviews Eastwood mentions as that’s just not how he saw his film. This is what I meant when I mentioned the film to be a least expected perspective on the life of J Edgar. Rumours about his sexuality were rife through his tenure and post – and even when the film was under production it’s an angle most viewers were expecting. In that sense, J Edgar stands as a bit of a letdown, to be ignoring such a potentially controversial subject matter.  DiCaprio only grows with every film, and J Edgar is testament to this fact. He grows as Hoover in the film too; while the younger Hoover is a bit one-dimensional in his ambitious enthusiasm, the older and more vindictive Hoover remains one of DiCaprio’s best performances till date. Writer Dustin Black (also written Milk) follows a fairly similar structure of a biopic, which includes the establishment, demystification and subtle homage of a public figure but kudos to Eastwood for sticking with a perspective (even though a bit narrow) and bringing out a personal, emotional and immensely political representation of J Edgar Hoover. The film could have done with better lines, and a tighter, more convincing first half (which tries too hard to establish Hoover as a likable figure, presumable as an antithesis to his portrayal later). However, watch the film for DiCaprio’s Hoover - his inner struggle and a commendable take on someone who was once known as America’s second most powerful man.

Shirish Kunder has used a very different and enjoyable style to direct flashbacks and dream sequences. Such innovativeness needs to be applauded and encouraged. Jaan-E-Mann can be appreciated for this particular novel approach, but do not expect anything more. Note that the direction is new, not the comedy. It is almost all…SLAPSTICK!!! 3-4 good laughs are not enough to pull a movie, which is based solely on comedy, through. It is a shame when embellished colour, lighting, and photography have to be used to convey emotions. It is a shame when wigs and exaggerated make-up have to be used to compensate for the lack of comic timing by our “stars”. It is a shame when Anupam Kher, Anupam Kher…the immensely talented comedian is unnecessarily dwarfed and has a nasal voice to make the movie funny. Now, that is a disgrace! Moreover, a generally overenthusiastic cameraman has used a weird camera angle and even weirder camera tricks to create the midget effect. Ridiculous, not funny, I say. And anyway, do people really think midgets are people to be laughed at?!? The rest is just ordinary. The story is just slightly, very slightly amended from your regular love-triangle-catapulting-woman-between-two-men affair. The much advertised 
twists will hardly bend a nerve in your brain.  The screenplay is choppy; transition from scene to scene is abrupt. And the movie a good 30 minutes too long. Preity Zinta does yet another ‘girl friend/spouse’ role, with her regular flair. She looks beautiful, especially in the pinks and peaches. Salman Khan uses his superbly toned body to overcome the lack of talent - again; someone ought to tell him muscle movement is good for his face too. Akshay Kumar once more wastes his potential on clowning around aimlessly. Aman Verma looks like he is competing for the loudest speaker of the year award. The performances are not helped by the inappropriate sound mixing. In some of the songs, the voices are so loud that you barely can listen to the music and in some scenes the background music overshadows the dialogue. The music of 'humko maloom hai' is agonizing, especially 'galtiyaaaaaaaan'. The lyrics of the ‘sad - humko maloom hai’ and ‘ajnabee shehar’ are good. But looks like Gulzar saahab was specifically asked to write extra simple lines for the target audience. Most of the other songs are outright prose – not poetry. But, hey it’s the festive season, who cares about plots and good lines? There are enough takers out there for tomfoolery, and this one is the giver.

You'll live without knowing where this one came from! It tries to be funny, but is barely so. It tries even harder to be sweet and romantic and ends up being yucky-mushy. So, neither this nor that, nothing other than Riteish's performance to look out for. ","What IS love? A movie, which has its protagonist arrive, all the way, from Venus (yes, the planet) to find out how humans fall in love should have answered that question, neigh? Apparently, love is that flimsy thing that moves on from one person to another in no time, for an equally flimsy reason. It can be argued that the film proposes that, such flimsiness occurs only till one finds 'true love'. But only a few of us will delve that deep into the movies altruistic purpose. For now, the take home is, ""if you love someone, tell them quick!""One thing I really appreciated about the film…No, I'm not being sarcastic!...is that the 'other' guy is not a lame character. He is the kind who can woo a girl and is not playing games to win her approval. This is such a welcome and refreshing change from the ""Loser"" or ""crooked-minded"" 'other' guy we see in our films. This one 'different' characterization and Riteish Deshmukhs's performance are about the two things that make this movie just about watchable. But, that too is to be taken with a pinch of salt. Interesting characters are a necessity not a luxury, so why should an audience have to thank the makers for one. And once a possibly engaging situation is created, you still have to take it further and hold you on till the climax. No such luck, here. You know the outcome well in advance, and the rest is just a formality. Formality is also what the other actors seem to be doing with their characters. The women have to look pretty and be the chirpy-bubblies to distract from the fact that there is actually no real plot. They do look pretty, but that's about it. They are not even granted a few of the mush-gush ""snore-snort worthy"" romantic lines that the men are ordained with. What's left then, is filled with supposed-comedy. A sample is Kaushal, Rajesh's (Riteish Deshmukh's) friend's interest in all things sex. Just that one single track running through his mind is apparently as Rajesh's alter-ego. If they ever did, I'd think those jokes worked like 10 years ago. I assume, the youth towards whom the film is targeted, has better humor than that. And their idea of love. Oops! Did I just admit that I'm too old for such tripe? I hope not, for the future of comedy and romance in our cinema, I hope not.

No less and unfortunately, no more.","Jaane tu is sweet, but not saccharine sweet. It's more the fun, peppy sweet. Yet it does not reach the heights of a lasting entertainer, mainly because of the sudden limp in the story 3/4ths way down the line. It just came across as aimless and rather random after that.However, the spoof-ish undercurrent running through the movie is completely adorable. The digs on all things ""Hindi cinema"" are thoroughly enjoyable. And I could almost sense how the writer is having a hearty laugh by having the audience lap up, the mother of all clichéd climaxes, without complaining. The college campus feel of the movie is going to make the young identify with the characters and their situations. And the slightly less young will enjoy the nostalgia. I liked the way various relationships were built. Be it the mother-son, the father from the portrait-son, the brother-sister, and of course friends and lovers - all these equations came across well but yet had an anti-climatic feel about it. Genelia and Imran Khan both bring a breath of freshness on the screen. It's as much their timing as it's the natural, much needed casualness they afford their characters that make them dear to the audience. I especially liked the insecure, confused, disappointed body language that Genelia presented in the second half. We know for sure that they are here for the long haul, at least for the chirpy, less serious kind of roles.Anything ""Aamir Khan"" has to have music that adds to the ambience of the movie and its true with this one too. So, even with a forced in number like ""pappu can't dance"" you find yourself swaying to the music. While there isn't a shred of doubt that ""kabhi kabhi aditi"" is one of the most romantic numbers to have come out in recent times, ""pappu can't dance"" and ""nazre milana"" have also grown on me with repeated hearings. To be honest, I just don't feel right judging a movie while sitting in the corner seat of the third row (from the screen). The camera angles, the colors, the sound - all seem off to me. So, I think it'd be unfair to make any comment on any of these aspects. So, yeah, I had a smile on throughout the movie but the base story is a little disappointing in terms of originality. I felt a little cheated by the ultimate turn of events somehow didn’t go with the tone of the movie and thus made it land in the ""much ado about nothing"" category.

The second half is uneventful and is dull. Unfortunately,  Jab Harry Met Sejal isn't one of those romantic films that let you enjoy the “nothing is happening” ambiance it carries. However, it has these moments between the lead pair that are honest - where they step back and warn each other; where they take an introspective look at themselves too. This honesty is so rare in romantic Hindi films that you could appreciate Jab Harry Met Sejal just for that. Imtiaz Ali has the knack for writing a story that stands solely on its lead couple - the conversations they have, the chemistry they share. There are minimal extraneous characters, so you spend those two+ hours living, breathing, and feeling only what these two characters feel. So much so that when the side stories do come, they seem very out of place.  However, the situations this couple finds itself in as they travel from city to city are rather random. Aside from quaint Europe that can be captured beautifully, these situations seem to be written with the intention of exposing a little about the characters each time, and also why the other is falling in love with them. However, the broader stroke of “looking for an engagement ring that the lady has lost” is stretched too far. The metaphor that the search for the ring tries to underline with explicit dialogue also seem a far stretch. What keeps the film alive is the snappy dialogue and the performances. For those of us who cannot handle the typical Shah Rukh Khan hamming, you will be happy to know there's very little of that. He has good control over the character. In fact, there were instances when it felt like he wanted to give an even better performance. But he remembered that he is Shah Rukh Khan who has an image to keep that would be shattered if he continued the good act. Very meta, I say.Also, I have always liked this intensity with which he looks into the eye of the woman making her believe she is the only woman in the world. It always takes my breath away and transports me to the moment they are in. Jab Harry Met Sejal has quite a few of these and they don't get old. Unfortunately, Anushka Sharma's attempt to stick to the Gujrati accent, that her character supposedly needs, distract from her performance. She does seem like that simple girl her character is making out to be – one who has maturely decided to stay innocent, even naive. So much so you wonder through most of the first half, “What is she playing at?” Harry too is trying to save himself from his supposedly misbehaving self. Characters with these contrasts are always engaging. The shift between their childlike chemistry to intense attraction flows smoothly too. Jab Harry Met Sejal also evokes another part of a relationship that is rarely touched – the phase just before separation when the couple is together but start living the separation a few days in anticipation. The impending sorrow is brought into the present, marring today's togetherness. But, this finesse in writing is lost when it comes to the episodic situations and the overarching theme of one person completing another by making him/her a better person. “Loving someone as they are”, is for another film, I guess. That aside, Jab Harry Met Sejal is also one of those films that has great music which shouldn't have made it into the film. They reek of commercial considerations rather than having roots in the story. The wedding song and the lovely duet, both seem so forced that they might as well have just started singing and dancing instead of trying to mask them with excuses to make them a part of the film. That work instead could've been used to shorten the film and keep the film from being underwhelming. The kind of underwhelming where you are wondering which type of clichéd climax you are headed for. The only reason then to watch this one in the theater if you want to watch a film for seeing Europe on big screen.~ ~ ~p.s. I had the most amusing and amused person sitting next to me in the theater. She was laughing so loudly through the first half that I changed seats during interval. Almost like Janice from the TV series F.R.I.E.N.D.S, I exaggerate not. Also, she couldn't stop saying, “Oh my God, so haaawt”, “so sexy” every time Shah Rukh Khan or Anushka Sharma came on screen. Though I changed seats, I was just so happy to see how much she was enjoying herself. She had come to have a blast and she made sure she did.

But for most parts it doesn't let you forget that it is after all a film.,"People do crazy things when they have faith - whether that belief lies in love, God or anything in between.  And we shouldn't be surprised to have Yash Chopra explore this theme, when he has picked romance as the genre. Unfortunately though, only few times in the film do you want to change your belief that this is only a film, far far from reality. Very few.Sure, it might not have aimed at being real at all. But it doesn't sweep you off your feet in a fairy tale like manner either. In my mind, it will stay as the last film made by the man who made films that had characters who were human, who had emotions like you and me, who had stories that absorbed me. Nothing more, and fortunately nothing less.  Only unfortunately, this time around I have seen them too many times on screen. And they are telling me their story instead of playing it out. Shah Rukh Khan doesn't let you forget that he is Shah Rukh Khan. So much so that you can predict the expression he is going to have as a reaction to whatever just happened. Yet, the way he looks at his woman is something only the rare woman cannot be charmed by. The rest of his body language though is as annoying as it has been in almost every other film. Katrina Kaif too, doesn't allow you to think of her as a woman of great faith, like her character is supposed to be. Fortunately for her though, the rest of her character is something that we associate with her instantly, London-bred desi who has it all. Though that works for the casting bit, it doesn't say much about her acting skills or that of the writer's creativity. Anushka Sharma plays her characters bit of chirpiness and forced seriousness. But then again her character must be the most superficially written. More like a representative of today's youth. More like a stereotype of today's youth – shallow, self-centered people waiting to be taken into the depths that real life is about. You are spoonfed adjectives that you are expected to associate each character with. Samar (Shah Rukh Khan) is the stud, looks-at-death-in-its-eye, poet, romantic. Akira (Anushka Sharma) is the bubbly, exuberant, let-the-devil-care,  woman of 2012. Meera (Katrina Kaif) is the enigmatic, guarded waiting-to-be-swept-off-her-feet, whose faith in her God is as unshakable as her namesake. After this initial exposure, you are waiting to be completely sucked into their stories. But it doesn't happen. It shows promise every once in a while, but doesn't come through. The story itself is more or less predictable. And the theme of undying love is dealt with pretty much the same way. Yet, it has a few moments of charm, a few moments of genuine chemistry between the characters. It has a couple of the quintessential Yash Chopra woman-to-woman scenes that I so admire, even if they are nowhere close to the ones in Silsila or Lamhe. Yet, it has the 'aawww' for the romantically-inclined. It has moments that make you want to fall in love for the first time , all over again. But they aren't taken through to the climax. I must say though that the runtime at 3 hours didn't bother me. That is a huge plus considering I start getting fidgety around minute 120. One thing that bothers me though is that, in their attempt at making a story that rings true in today's time, the young and hip seem to define a lot of their love in terms of physical attraction. The sexual tension for those brief moments (before the camera angles and music all go melodramatic on us) while done well, seem pivotal to the relationships. This seems a little out of character in the film. A bit of that might be brought back into balance because the film does seem to address the youth of today. It is indeed telling us all to believe. To believe in love. To have hope that it will come to everyone, when the time comes.Yet, the only driving force behind recommending this film is as a tribute to the director.  Something, I'd watch for the sake of completeness - that I have tried to see all his films. But, I'd still go back to a Trishul or a Deewar or a Kala Pathar or a ...

The story is as far from reality as can be, but then, that is what escapist cinema is all about, right?","It's warm, it's cuddly, it's adorable, and it's telling the truth in the disclaimer at the beginning - it's fictional. Obviously, characters like Aditya Kashyap and Geet can exist only in imagination. But we are used to letting go of our need for ""resemblance to reality"". And once you do that you begin to identify with the emotions playing on the screen at that moment, even though the character as a whole is pretty unreal.Life is unambiguous when it is black and white. Everything is crystal clear. My problem with stories usually begins when people transition from black to white (or vice versa) without going through the gray. Here, it irritates, it nags, but soon enough the dialogues and the sheer charm of the actors playing the characters take you away from thinking too much about it. The dialogues have a very fresh feel to them. They are outright funny at times and quite perceptive at others. And they are hardly ever mundane (except the one given to Dara Singh!). What I found most interesting is that, whether comic or thoughtful, they were very believable. It must be some sort of an art form to actually make use of Kareena Kapoor's over-capacity to bubble and sparkle - it's very well woven into the story. I have always liked the way her eyes express her character's sorrow. But, in the movies I have watched so far, it is usually a glimpse, just a flicker. Here however, she retains the tone impressively for a longer time. It is also great to see Shaheed Kapoor get the chance to show his maturity as an actor. As clichéd as the events might turn out to be, you don't want his character to be hurt.How can escapist cinema survive without its song and dance? We have plenty of foot-tapping numbers with fresh lyrics. The visualization of the songs was also done well. Especially, ""tumse hi"" - makes you really believe that the characters are in love.The length of the movie works against it. The average runtime of a movie in recent times is about two hours. There should be a very good reason for me to stay the extra 20-25 minutes, without fidgeting. And in this case, there was no spectacular cause to hold me. Tarun Arora's (Anshuman's) sequences were handled rather shabbily - almost as if they were intentionally ignored so that the audience does not empathize with him. They should have been cut down to bare minimum. And Dara Singh was absolutely, totally, completely avoidable - from all aspects - relevance to story, line(s) given to him, and the way he delivers them.While watching the movie, there were various points at which, I wanted the script to take an unexpected turn. A turn that would make it a little more substantial than just ""time-pass"". But, that was not to be. It's silly, it's mushy-mushy, it's not to be taken seriously at all - it's a perfect date movie. No more, no less.

475,573,573,573,573,Jack Reacher,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/jack-reacher-review/,,,,4.133333333,"Tom Cruise is back, this time as iconic pulp literary character Jack Reacher, from the Lee Child novels. The film honestly isn’t a bad watch, primarily because of its gritty, rugged feel as well as its lead actor’s usual charm. However, the film isn’t going to grab you by the throat and make your jaw drop with awe either.","I must confess at the outset that I haven’t read any of Lee Child’s novels, so I have no inherent knowledge or fondness for the character of Jack Reacher, played by Tom Cruise in the film. I’ve heard, though, that die-hard fans of the books and the character felt, right from the time of its announcement, that Tom Cruise was a bad fit as Reacher; some research will tell you that he certainly doesn’t match the physical attributes of the character. Well, one of the big problems with Jack Reacher, the film, is that the cinematic Reacher just doesn’t come across as a character worth being a die-hard fan of in the first place.A daring murder of five seemingly random people in broad daylight leads to the arrest of an ex-military sniper who clearly looks guilty of this shocking crime. However, the murder ends up getting Jack Reacher, an ex-military investigator embroiled in the case, as the crime seems to be far murkier than what it looked like on the surface. On the plus side, the film has a constant sense of mystery about it. Not treated like one would normally expect a big-budget, Hollywood action film to be treated, the film unfolds slowly, without fanfare. So, while new facts and faces are uncovered all the time, it doesn’t really announce them or dwell long on them. The background music is also surprisingly held in check, with long bits of silence embellished with nothing more than just gentle ambient sound. The result is the kind of thriller that relies on mood and atmosphere to work its charms, rather than grand unveils of a good ol’ ‘big twist’ or two.Also, the action is a refreshing change from what one is used to seeing big Hollywood stars do in their big films. It is grittier, more personal, hand-to-hand combat and precision-sniping rather than cable-propelled, gravity-defying slambang-ery that is more prevalent in films mounted on this scale. That and its lead hero’s charms make it seem more intense, less ‘in your face’.However, what the film gains in terms of mood, it loses that and then some because of its writing. The plot itself is like an old-school American spy film. The screenplay has enough flaws and raises enough fundamental questions for you to poke away at it continuously in real time, while your brain is processing it. That combined with the fact that everyone seems to be taking themselves and their characters far too seriously in the film makes you want to, every once in a while, tap some character on the shoulder and ask them, “You’re kidding me, right?” Cruise himself seems to be the only who seems to have understood what the real tone of the treatment should have been like. He has a perpetual, all-knowing poker face about him; like he’s teasing the audience with the feeling that he actually knows what’s going on and is playing us along for the fun of it. If that had been how the rest of the characters had been interpreted and portrayed, it could have actually made for a fun watch. The character of Reacher itself seems rather bland and uninteresting, which made me wonder why it has such a following in the first place. I guess that can only be answered by actually reading the books.The only other cast member who evokes any reaction, that too only for his presence rather than any acting skill, is the great Werner Herzog who plays a shady, comic-book-ish operator. Rosamund Pike looks lovely and performs earnestly, but even she faces the same problem of taking herself and the film far too seriously.Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie hasn’t done much wrong with ‘Jack Reacher’. The problem really lies in the fact that he hasn’t done very much right either. The next few years will see him collaborate with Cruise quite often; his name is already attached with the next Mission: Impossible film, as well as the Top Gun sequel. Hopefully he’ll get his act together in time to manage to use his larger-than-life movie star in a far better manner. Jack Reacher is the kind of film which hardcore fans of Cruise (such as myself) would quite like. Others may like it for its calm, intense and dark tone, but I don’t see very many people being blown away by the film.

Juggles all of that well but becomes long-drawn in the process.","It takes a while to get used to the strange of a musical and an arm deal. We are conditioned to see musicals as romantic or comedy or a combination of the two. Sure, Sound of Music did mix a world war with a musical, but when things got serious, it shed its musical layer. Jagga Jasoos stays on the high note for quite a bit. To the extent, that I worried we are never going to hear a plain dialogue, and tire of the music soon. Thankfully, the music gives way and the film stays cute and fun through to its long-drawn out climax. The music takes a while to get used to because a lot of it is not Indian, it sounds like a western choir for a huge portion - but Indians are acting it out. It has a Broadway feel to it more than a musical movie. However, the music is lilting and the lyrics keep you attentive. I am not sure, I could listen to the music stand alone, like I can for Barfi. But, once you grow accustomed to it, the music goes really well with the tone and texture of Jagga Jasoos while you are watching it. The lyrics, even if they take on an extra syllable here and there, are strung well together. The essay on “a goat” is truly entertaining, for instance. There are even a few lessons in history and political science delivered through song. Right from the first frame, you know you are in for a fascinating visual and aural experience. Visually, the film is mesmerising with its use of colour. The transitions from one part of the story to another are in the face yet not tiring. Some action bits seem shoddy, but then again, that can be explained away by the fact that it is intentionally, part-animation.My worry that the “musical” form of narrative is used as a gimmick to cover up the lack of story is laid to rest, even if it is not completely unfounded. The thriller can hardly be called taut and wouldn't have worked a bit, had it not been for the narrative style it takes. At the same time it is not entirely lame. In making light of things, the attempt is to make the audience think about our attitude towards world tragedies. Also, in trying to be a little of everything, the film stretches a bit beyond holding interest. It even over-explains at some spots. Each sequence, plays out like a short story that is a little longer than what might have been necessary. This, bit by bit, adds up to the 160-minute length time - a good 30 minute more than what retains interest in general. However, these short stories sort-of tie in together and flow from one to the other. The flow is smooth enough that Shruti as the narrator seems rather superficial. Shruti as a journalist in the main narrative also seems like a forced-in character. The movie is about Jagga, his quests and his longing for his father. Shruti seems to be there for, well as sad as it sounds, visual variety. It doesn't help that Katrina Kaif is almost in her worst form. Yet again, her character is from London to justify the actor's accent. Her dubbing is way off. That is criminal in a musical - lots of lip-syncing to go wrong and unfortunately it does too. In some way, Ranbir Kapoor's act makes up for that let down. The genre does ask for some gimmickry in performances. Yet, he makes Jagga, a potentially fictional character, seem real. He will remind you of Tintin and Harry Potter (I was even reminded of Sholay, Satte Pe Satta and Khoobsurat), but not so much of Ranbir Kapoor himself. For Jagga as a character, there is no real attempt at creating grey characters, so the characters are simple, making the film gear toward a younger audience. The writing hints at deeper concerns for the world, hands out philosophical words of wisdom every once in a while and even touches upon the dilemma of a superhero – to save the world or to save the loved one. Yet, it chooses not to go too deep or linger too long with these thoughts, and arguably rightly so too – lest the film take a serious turn that it isn't meant to. The story is out from a comic book and wants to be rooted there, while taking shots at the real world. Jagga, Tooti-frooti, and Shruti do take you around their fairy-tale world. Yet, this fairyland is quite close to the world we live in. So much so that if it weren't for the music, the colours, the quirky, kiddish, borderline slapsticky humor you would be left with a film that was a sad documentation of our times. To even think of mixing these things together is a step in the much wanted experimental territory – for this attempt alone I am stunned by the long stride Jagga Jasoos has taken. Most of all, it is a decent kids film from India. That the narration could have been crisper and the story a tad deeper, we can leave to its promise of a sequel.

Engaging even if not new, while you are there and awfully ordinary once you are out of the theater.","Jai Gangaajal is what you expect it to be. The law-and-order-administration-politicians-businessmen nexus is out to get the powerless common man. Comes along a conscientious police officer who takes the nexus on. Except this once, the police officer is a woman. It is great to see that just because the officer is a woman, things don't change much. The men around her don't give her extra leeway nor do they take advantage. It is nice to see a woman treated like just another person. However, the film then has nothing too new to offer.Sure, the back and forth between the two sides is stronger in this film compared to the Singhams, Dabangg Agains, and Rowdy Rathores. However, it remains second fiddle to Gangaajal. Is that because it has a woman as the lead? I'd say no. It felt like it was more because she wasn't the only hero. It was nice to see the main protagonist and an actor of Priyanka Chopra's stature to give that much space to another character. Now, it might come across like a woman can't do her job without a man. However, I would go out on a limb and say, the job of taking on such ruthless and powerful people isn't one person's job. A team working towards one goal is relatively more believable compared to a one-man army. It also works well that the lady here is more like the inner voice of all the policemen in her force. However, would an male actor of this stature have agreeably played second fiddle? Would the lady herself have been okay had it not been the director of the film? Let's say these questions are outside the purview of the experience of the film. Then, I'd walk in with the understanding that it is about Bholenath Singh's (Prakash Jha) inner struggle and the lady police officer, Abha Mathur (Priyanka Chopra) is secondary in the story. Once you change that point of view, you have a very interesting story of a cold and ruthless police officer realising his precarious and dispensable position. Of course, you have to swallow the quick turn around. Yet, the well-developed remorse is not very common. And what a fine actor Prakash Jha is! He makes Bholenath's move from arrogance to brooding to soft-hearted believable despite its improbability. Unfortunately, so consumed he seems to have been with acting that he missed out on asking Priyanka Chopra to lose her model-like gait. When she is at one place though, she tries her best to make her voice sound authoritative. But then, she moves. And the model is back. Manav Kaul can now do a hot-headed politician in his sleep. Ninad Kamat as his brother though shines as the goon who's tantrums can put any two-year old to shame.There is another character in the film that is vying for your attention. All. The. Time. The background score. It is relentless. It is loud. It doesn't go with the film. There were a few scenes in the second half when it takes a break and they are beautiful. Those scenes made me want to see the film once again with the background track turned off. It wouldn't be a surprise, if the film becomes better manifold. As it stands though Jai Gangaajal engages you while you are in the theater – maybe making you a little fidgety towards the end because it is over 2.5 hours. But once you are out and think about it, if at all, you realise it is not too out of the ordinary. Except that you want to watch more of Prakash Jha as an actor.

","He may be a cop, a thief, a spy, a bodyguard or a buffoon - He's Salman Khan and he'll beat people around him to pulp. He'll do it to the cheers and whistles of his audience. He'll do it with his unique style that you can hate or love, but cannot ignore even if you tried. Oh yes, they try to have a story in Jai Ho which attempts to ignite the human in you.So, here's our good samaritan (yeah, that's how good he is) Jai (Salman Khan) who helps people and wants to spread his idea of goodness. Only that he is hot-tempered, so his help invariably involves violence. A lot of violence. I guess, being a Salman Khan film we should just be thankful that this time around the character he plays isn't looting the rich to help the poor, to give his character that shade of grey. There I go again, looking for work in the writing department in a film of this genre, having this star. However, I did like that they try to propagate the ""do good, feel good"" idea. If only, the movie stuck to it, itself. Unless of course, the idea of a common man beating every criminal in sight - is ""do good"". Aah, now there's an idea. And yet, when a military tanker vandalizes property, it gets a bit much, even if it is out of goodness of the heart, for the goodness of the heart.I must admit though, for a change Jai Ho has more focused writing than any of Salman's recent films. It doesn't deviate from its theme or violence, but for that occasional song and dance number. It doesn't take the romantic detour for too long too. Even the villains want to harass his other family members rather than his love interest. Which is about as good as it gets, for to see Tabu play a side character hurts. She stands tall, she tries to bring composure to the film, she does her bit, but it still hurts. I felt sorry for Genelia D'Souza too. Maybe her character too, but mostly the actor for the length of the character she plays. It is very difficult to no relate it to her post-marriage career. Anyway, lead lady Daisy Shah is the quintessential pretty, dumb love interest who does her bit of cutesy and is ""out of sight, out of mind"" for the other characters, writers, and the audience. The only actor who actually gives a performance-performance is Naman Jain who plays Salman Khan's nephew. Not only is he cute, he is confident and delivers his lines with perfect timing. Also, his role is written well - doesn't make him sound like an adult but at the same time keeping him in line with any boisterous child of this day and age would talk.Otherwise, Jai Ho is the typical mix of action, silly humor, romance, loud background score, and ill-placed mediocre songs. Though, ""baaki sab first class hai"" does have decent lyrics. Too little to hang on to for a film that last 2.5 hours.Throughout the film, I just couldn't shake off the fact that Salman Khan is calling himself a common man. Oh, it's the character that's the common man? Yeah right! Even for the sake of argument, if you ignore that Salman plays Salman in the film, how can you ignore not every common man or a common woman's brother has six packs and muscle power to take down 20 people in one go. And without that, how do we do good and spread the word?

The possibly interesting story is squandered away in favour of shameless commercialization.","In a film, if there is anything that grates more than the fact that the lead actor can’t act to save his or her life, it is over-the-top, shameless in-film branding. Jai Jai Maharashtra Maza, directed by Gautam Joglekar, unfortunately has both these problems. So, despite a story that had reasonable potential, Jai Jai Maharashtra Maza is little more than a waste of one’s time. What you’ll walk away with after this film are Fair & Lovely, Amanora, Sanjay Ghodawat Group, Volkswagen, Shamrao Vitthal Bank and then some. Ashwini Stevenson (played by Anusha Dandekar) is the world’s number one female tennis player. Adopted from an orphanage in Pune when she was still an infant, she was brought up by her American adoptive mother, Gail Stevenson. Meanwhile, Dilip & Amruta Rege are a happily married couple who are still romantic at heart even after 25 years of marriage. Their paths collide when it comes forth that Ashwini’s and Amruta’s pasts are intricately linked.Mahesh Manjrekar and Mrunal Kulkarni, who play the Reges, are easily the best things about the film. Manjrekar’s character, in particular, will be universally appreciated because of the way it is written and the calm manner in which Manjrekar essays the part. Also lending a decent supporting hand are Siddharth Chandekar (who plays their son) and Hemant Dhome, who plays a charming bumpkin from Kolhapur. But no amount of decent acting from the others can take away from the lack or excess of it on the part of Anusha Dandekar. On the surface, she seems perfect for the part of a Marathi girl brought up as an American. But her character seems like it was developed out of screenwriting sessions held purely by five-year olds. Add to that the fact that Anusha’s dialogue delivery is extremely weak, be it in English or Marathi. The result is that watching her on screen in this film is a cumbersome task, one that you just cannot wait to get over with. Embarrassing guest appearances by Aditi Govitrikar and Karishma Shah do nothing to help the film’s cause.Attempting to shoot the film in vibrant colours, the makers of the film succeed in making the film look fresh. However, like so many films in the past, it is easy to tell which shots were shot with a DSLR. Also, there are often times when it looks like the cinematographer is trying too hard, particularly during some close up shots of faces.The inconsistent writing is another serious flaw in the film. The romantic track between Anusha Dandekar and Hemant Dhome is highly implausible and is poorly developed. There is also a moralistic sidetrack about the ills of sensationalist journalism today, which seems almost incongruent with the manner in which brands are plugged throughout the film. Which brings me back to that which will trouble the audience the most. How is one supposed to take a song tribute to Pune seriously, when the name and number of a cab agency is thrust in front of your face every few minutes? How do you identify with a character when you have the Fair & Lovely signature tune playing whenever she pauses to catch a breath? How is the audience supposed to get involved with the characters, when they pause to extoll the virtues of a group that is involved in construction, which also happens to be the producer of film? Cinema is a powerful medium, one that was always going to fall prey to excessive commercial misuse. But Jai Jai Maharashtra Maza takes it to dizzying new levels of shamelessness. For that reason alone, the makers of the film need to learn a lesson in not taking the audience for granted. Jai Jai Maharashtra is watchable, but avoiding it will do no one any harm at all.

Bad acting makes it worse.,"A movie starts and it goes on and on and on. Not in terms of sluggish pace, but just that it's playing and you are watching because you are there - indifferent and uninvolved. It is movies like these which try to stylize Kunal Khemu and Fardeen Khan that make you appreciate the charisma of Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan. At least their screen presence makes them worthy of all the slo-mo entries they've been awarded over the years. Kunal Khemu has just no oomph factor whatsoever; why he's asked to don ""star"" like mannerisms is just incomprehensible. Not to mention that he has a very annoying voice and dialogue delivery style. Reminds of the shrieky, eye-candy women in regular Hindi slapstick films. And Fardeen Khan does his tiny-mouth-pout with a nose flare that only he is capable of, to emote anger and love. It's not like there isn't room for variation in the concept but the emotions run only skin-deep. The story is no great shakes, as in, by and large things are predictable. But, every once in a while there are a couple of lines or a tiny twist that take it away that little bit from the absolutely thoughtless genre of films. And here again it is left at that and not taken an inch deeper.Like any other movie of this style, songs appear 'just because...' But what gets annoying is the ridiculous set designs and wannabe 'stylish' type of camerawork during the songs. Also the voices used for the actors are so different from their own voices that they distract even more from the viewing experience. Though there was this one visual with Dia Mirza wearing a bright red and orange flowing skirt and swaying around in radiant-blue sea water. Whether her dress was losing color in water or the colors were mixed intentionally it doesn't matter. It was just beautiful. Anyway, this is yet another absolutely skippable movie. But, if you happen to see snippets, you can hold on for a bit.

483,581,581,581,581,Janis And John,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/janis-and-john-review/,,,,4.2,"Don’t expect to laugh out loud, roll on the floor laughing or laugh your ass off with Janis and John. It’s funny film, nonetheless, that will grip you with its unbelievably far-fetched premise and drag you in a whirlwind of ups and downs. Without including an element of drama in the film, it still brings out some of the most endearing performances from the three leading actors. Also note how the famous songs of the two late rock icons, Lennon and Joplin, intertwine with the narrative of the film in a celebratory manner. ","The definition of comedy has seen an immense makeover since the Shakespeare days. There’s slapstick comedy, satire, black comedy and even rom-com. Similarly, there’s also Haha-funny, Lol-funny and what I’d like to called ‘witty-repartee’ funny. But there are some films that coin their own meaning of funny. Janis and John is one such film, which translates a sense of humour into an entire movie. There’s no name for it, it’s just a simple film about a really funny situation. Period. Janis and John is set in France around an Insurance salesman Pablo Sterni, (Sergi Lopez) who schemes to dupe his drug-addicted cousin for 500,000 francs: by arranging for the second coming of Janis Joplin and John Lennon. It’s a crazy synopsis, and the first half of the film, which constitutes the set-up of the fraud, is equally crazy. The humour tone of the film lies in this very craziness. As a viewer you wonder, how in the world is this going to work out? The two actors playing fake John Lennon (Francois Cluzet playing a failed actor) and Janis Joplin (Marie Trintignant, also Sterni’s wife) are remarkably aloof in the beginning. The film graphs their con journey and the whirlpool situations they find themselves in. The fanatic cousin, Leon’s (Christopher Lambert) sheer reason of existence is the return of his two rock idols. He’d been looking forward to it since he (allegedly) met them in a restroom, where they happened to promise him they would return. The first time Janis and John reach his record shop, we get a glimpse into his fanaticism. We’ve seen such behavior - young teenagers shouting and screaming around rock stars, girls fainting at the sight of an idol, and more such madness. However, the idea of fanaticism is dealt slightly differently in this film. Leon’s record shop has everything from a replica of the revolver than killed Lennon to Joplin’s favorite Whiskey, Southern Comfort. He seems like a more somber fan, but in reality through his actions you can tell his fanaticism is more about the mania - a kind that could pose some serious trouble. The rest of the film is one interesting incident after another. Cluzet and Trintignant are absolutely hilarious in the film, in their mission to be celebrities. The star of the film is most certainly Marie Trintignant, who transforms from a meek housewife to a fake Janis Joplin- but it’s a transformation that will shock you. Unfortunately, Trintignant passed away in an unfortunate accident after the shooting of the film. Towards the end of the film, director Samuel Benchetrit, also Marie’s huband, has included many slow, close up shots of her - posing as a silent tribute. The DVD has no special features, apart from a small 10-minute compilation of uncut scenes. They mostly show Marie and Cluzet trying to perform Lennon and Joplic songs and failing miserably. The scenes graph their struggle to be like rock icons, who in all honestly cannot be replaced. This is the reason why the film is so amusing. Dialogues and performances apart, the film is funny because it’s a simple account of a highly implausible situation. Watch the film on a lazy afternoon; not for a few laughs, but for a slow, long-lasting smile.

484,582,582,582,582,Jannat,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewNotepadPreview22 Critic Reviews 1.8/5.0 3 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/jannat-review/,1.8/5.0,5/5.0,,3.866666667,Jannat - An engrossing watch which raises some philosophical questions. A story well told but yet doesn't warrant a trip to the theaters.,"A 'Materialism versus idealistic simplicity' theme runs heavily through Jannat. So, who wins? If only it were that easy to answer. Such a deep philosophical question cannot be answered in 2.5 hours, and isn't answered either. So, if you are looking for a conclusion, a closure, Jannat is not for you. I'm sure you could easily replace the cricket-match-fixing backdrop with any dishonest activity and arrive at the same result. But, cricket feels fresh and the season is right, so why not? The dialogues spiced up with references to retired cricketers and some cricketing events in the recent past are good enough to keep you interested too. The climax of the movie reminded me of a 5-6 pages long, Marathi essay I had written in school - ""An autobiography of a soldier"". In the end, my soldier who was taken in as a prisoner of war was released because the enemy got bored of him and his silence. My teacher appreciated the writing style but made a concluding remark, ""did the enemy get bored, or did you get bored of writing?"" I only smiled sheepishly at getting caught. Something similar seems to have happened with the writer here. A nicely developed plot got shot in the middle, absolutely abruptly. Like many other movies out of the Bhatt camp, Jannat revolves around the romance between the lead pair. I really enjoy the way their relationship builds and the tumult it goes through. Important moments are given space and time to develop. There is a certain human element in these movies that clicks and you can sense the expected chemistry.Emraan Hashmi's (Arjun) acting has begun growing on me over the last few movies. So much so that the unidentifiable thing about his looks that used to irritate me, does so a little less now. A fearless gambler who can woo and romance his lady love with the right dosage of style - all this falls flat when he is required to cry. Same goes for the pretty looking Sonal Chauhan's (Zoya's) performance too. What I can't come to terms with however, are the shabby performances by the supporting cast, except maybe Samir Kochchar (Inspector/CBI official). Everyone else, from Javed Shaikh (Don in South Africa) to Vipin Sharma (Arjun's dad - isn't he getting tired of playing the dissatisfied dad, already?!), seem superficial and are just reading out their lines. There was no way to judge how well Arjun's friend was performing, because the bad dubbing was extremely distracting.On the other hand, the tight close-ups worked really well, because they were used rarely when the facial expressions were important enough to deserve exclusive attention. I also particularly liked the use of handheld camera just for Arjun. in the scene just before the interval - sort-of hinting that his life might not be as good as it seems after all. Otherwise the calm camera movements have a soothing effect. Like the softness in the narrative had a Vishesh Films stamp on it, the music had Pritam written all over it. In general, I enjoy this kind of music and enjoyed it as much as the other Bhatt-Pritam combinations that have been churned out earlier. Now, that it is him plagiarizing himself, who had earlier plagiarized some one else, is a different matter all together. And I didn't particularly like the way the title song was picturized though - a tad too artificial to go with the rest of the film.There isn't too much that I didn't like about the movie, but yet, it leaves only an okay-ish feeling while walking out of the cinema hall. Can't really point a finger at what went wrong other than the scenes in which people were crying and weren't very good at it. It might seem a wee bit longer than it needed to be, but that is not really the reason for me to be harsh. So, as always, I'm just going to stick to the feeling I came out with.

In many ways, Jannat 2 feels like a film that could've been a film worth watching once if it had a little better of everything, especially better actors to play the side characters and the villain.","What is it that makes Vishesh Films name its films to make them sound like sequels? Murder 2 earlier and now Jannat 2 have nothing to do with the films with the same names but for the number attached at the end. Is it that the producers are trying to bank on the success of the earlier films to get in the initial crowd? Is it lack of creativity? Is it pure laziness? Or is it mere disinterest? The same disinterest that shows through the film by the actors and the director.Of the entire team, only the writer seems to show interest right through the end of his assignment. Sonu Dilli (Emraan Hashmi), a small-time gun-dealer finds himself stuck between a cop (Randeep Hooda) who forces Sonu to turn into an informer; his willingness to live an honest living for the love of his life (Esha Gupta); and the bigger-time dons of the underworld (Manish Choudhary). A dilemma that could've been so much more engaging but for some awful performances and a tedious screenplay. Similarly, the dialogues are some of the most inane ones. The kind that actors should have objection to saying out loud, however inept they might be at their work. No, I'm not referring to perfunctorily used profanity Except for Emraan Hashmi, the rest of the cast is rather monotonous, each one seems to take to one expression and hold to it. This fact is more so evident in the cases of Randeep Hooda, Esha Gupta and Manish Choudhary. Anyway, as usual, the lead lady is made irrelevant in a crime saga. Despite all of this, I'd consider the climax one of the bravest ones in recent times. It is surprisingly unexpected for an otherwise predictable story. It is also an interesting one in terms of what it means to the various characters, even if they aren't written with too much depth. Yet, it can't take away from the fact that it is 'too little, and a little too late'. Jannat 2 is another one of those standard crime romances to come out of the Bhatt stable -  only less engaging than the average Vishesh Films' product.

Doesn't help the most ancient tug-of-war. Preachy dialogues and scenes that drag on manage to create a soporific effect in the theater.,"Remember those family feuds whose existence depended on ""killing romance""? Boy king, Girl maid-servant. Boy Hindu, girl Muslim. Boy vegetarian, Girl meat-eater, Boy's family and girl's family are enemies, oh and how can I forget Boy poor, girl rich. We have a little bit of a mish-mash from some of these themes in Jashnn. Which ones? Does it really matter? It is written shoddily and doesn't do any justice to whatever charm these films had should be enough to keep you away from this one. The film pretty much ends where it starts except for the sudden transformation of characters. Losers as protagonists have to be really, really charming and the storyline around them intriguing to make the film watchable. While the modernized love story which does a sudden about turn as the climax closes in is not palatable at all. Neither Adhyayan Suman nor his character Akash are charming. We have to grant that Adhyayan covers a huge range of emotions. But, there is something about his personality that doesn't cut him as a lead actor. And he doesn't have that much extra talent to excuse the lack of killer looks to pull him through. Anjana Sukhani on the other hand is a mildly pleasant surprise. There are times when her dialogue delivery is flat. But there are these glimpses in which a single twitch on her face communicate what her character feels. Alas, they are very few and long distances lie in between. I would have been able to comment on Shahana Goswami's act, if her dispeakable wardrobe didn't distract throughout the film. Sure, she needed to have a slutty look, but was it necessary to dress her in the most hideous outfits that didn't flatter her at all. Also her body language matched more that of a roadside prostitute rather than her otherwise supposedly grand lifestyle - standing with legs wide apart don't go with plush flats and flat screens, etc. For a movie coming out of the Bhatt camp, Jashnn has non-hummable music and just about alright lyrics. None of them are very impressive and have no repeat value at all. After going through all of this, thinking back about the film, I understand that the direction could have been a lot worse. I can also imagine the look and feel being a lot less kitschy. But that wouldn't be enough for one to sit through a movie. Sleep through - maybe. At least I felt like I was just up after a good nap when the credits rolled, though I did watch the entire film.

And that is exactly what we get with Jason Bourne. I, for one, have grown tired of the action being taken over by camera and editing. Even if there is a bit going on in the story, it becomes too much effort to focus on. And when you finally find that focus, you realise there isn't much in there.Sure, Jason Bourne has 3-4 threads playing against each other making it difficult to decide on the characters' loyalties. It is enough to make you wonder if there is more to the film than the run-of-the-mill action. However, the intrigue is not enough to keep you from being annoyed with the rest.  Surprisingly, the background score is subtle at times and not a pulsating theme running through the length of the film. There is well-shot mob sequence in the beginning too. It creates a bit of an excitement considering it relates to recent political developments. But, of course that has nothing to do with anything in the rest of the film. In action films the performances aren't usually anything special. The protagonist is always in the mouth of danger so he is always tense and in a rush. The antagonist is scheming and being suave. The others fall in line as need be without antagonizing or making you cheer for them.Jason Bourne, the film then is one long chase sequence with sub-chase sequences. The over-arching privacy vs. safety issue seems just like make-up or a fashionable buzz phrase that is needed for the audience to know that the presenters are in with the current times. The skeleton and flesh stays pretty much the same.

A feat very few movies can boast of. But, it takes forever to get there. ","If it were not for characters that mostly stay true their character till the end, especially through a long climax, Jaundya Na Balasaheb would be a very long film to sit through.Sure, there is fun dialogue and characters that belong to the milieu, but that tone is set in the first few minutes. The witticisms dry up and you get used to the characters and their accent. Thereafter, each line, each scene and sequence gives you the feeling that it wants to say something larger than what can be literally understood. The film is constantly trying to make a bigger point. And that weighs it down. Fair enough, the points – important ones at that - are made. But then there are too many. Jaundya Na Balasaheb ends up spreading itself thin over too many issues. Also, after a said point is made, what next? The sequence drags and overstays it's entertaining/educative welcome. The only thing that remains engaging are the interesting nicknames given to one and all characters in the village that the film is set in.Along the way though, we have some wonderful, even if at times theatrical, performances. But hey, they are practicing for a stageplay, so you can give them that. Having said that, a few characters reminded me of this very popular play, varhad nighalay londonla. The setting of a small Maharashtrian village, the characters and how they interact with each other and so on. However, Jaundya Na Balasaheb is a broad stroke and a pointed take on societal issues. The only thing that kept the film from being a complete bore is the superlative climax. For one, it is one you expect the least. To top it off, the concept is believable even if what actually happens is far from real. In fact, it made me wonder if all that slow build-up was in fact, necessary to have the said impact. Jaundya Na Balasaheb can also be accused of taking itself too seriously while clearly wanting to keep a light tone. This constant struggle shows. It is not an easy one to overcome, especially for a first time director.This socio-political satire would have worked better with about 45 minutes of it's run-time chopped off. This thought crossed my mind a lot while watching the film, “Every minute that takes a film beyond the 120-minute mark has to count 2-3 times more than usual.” And if you are thinking that while watching a film, it clearly hasn't fulfilled that requirement.

It doesn't engage, nor does it entertain. ","Jayantabhai Ki Love Story showed very little potential from it's trailers. So, despite all my needs of wanting to watch every film with neutrality, I went in expecting very little, if at all. The best I can say, is that I came out unscathed because of almost zero expectations. The 'bhaigiri' end of Jayantabhai Ki Love Story is unethusiastic and the love story end is stagnant. The film is pretty much flat throughout, except for a little ruffle in the feathers in the name of a climax.So, plain is the love story, that even after Jayanta (Vivek Oberoi) and Simran (Neha Sharma) take the 'big step' as a couple, they go back to their old relationship soon enough. Tiffs vanish and all becomes well, all too soon. Similarly, the underworld track of the film gathers no momentum at all. The conflict that they start doesn't see much change. Both patronage and animosity are superficial. You never figure why one is loyal to another or why they are at another person's throat. It is said so, and thus it should be believed. And the two tracks have very little do with each other. Whatever little intersection exists, is lame enough to be ignored. The rest is filled with slime-balls in the corporate world who seemed to be worse than infamous casting couches or with formulaic songs shot at exotic locations or gratuitous show of cleavage or other such inanity. Amidst the limp stories then, the smart-Aleckry in the dialogue brings in a laugh or two. You can also scoff at the Munnabhai references. Also, because everything else is so devoid of energy, the over-eager performances make you applaud their attempt at putting life into the characters. It is amazing then, that there are producers who willingly go through with such projects. What in Jayantabhai Ki Love Story wasn't told already and which frame had something that wasn't told in a better way elsewhere? You wonder, and only wonder.

After a decent start, completely warps logic and the associated human element. ","Jazbaa is superficial. The mother aches for her daughter, but it is the glycerin in those pretty wide eyes that tells you so. All characters are grey which is pretty rare in Hindi films but they don't come together to make the film interesting. The motivations are unclear which builds an air of mystery but the conclusion so convoluted that the only reaction can be a resounding facepalm.The dilemma setup and the whodunit aspects of the story create intrigue. You wonder how even a successful advocate like Anuradha Verma (Aishwarya Rai) will get out of the soup that she has been pulled into. But two things come in the way of this decent start, a muddled middle and an flummoxing end. Who goes after whom for what makes little sense, even after you know how it all ends. In fact, more so after you know who's done it after all. Its a shame because the plot is not entirely nonsensical until about three-fourths of the length of the film. Meanwhile, you also have the swag-infused philosophies that Yohaan (Irrfan Khan) spouts. Here the superficiality begins to show through the cracks. The cracks that Irrfan's straight-faced dialogue delivery tries hard to keep under cover. An act we are soon getting used to. Yet, give me a always poker-faced, subtle Irrfan any time and over and over again, over a stereotypical over-the-top “top” star. The lines given to him are actually not bad, but they are overdone. A line that has been worked upon too hard loses charm.Exactly like our lead lady's performance Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. The film opens with showing her fit, in fine form, pretty as ever with a lovely, slightly chubby face that which comes with aging gracefully and being a mommy. The hard work on both her fitness and performance show. Unfortunately, they are both distracting. She is so fit, her back so straight that even the drooping shoulders of a mother whose daughter has been kidnapped looks like a forced slouch – for effect. Her over-powering screen presencedoesn't cover up for the hard-to-lose model-like gait. As far as those bewildered, supposedly pain-stricken eyes go - no amount of shrieking over one's lungs can cover the fact that they have been artificially dampened. Even so I am excited about her return. Her performances have rarely inspired a word other than “plastic” from me. Irrespective of the success of this film, I am glad she is back. It is symbolic because she hasn't come back to where she left off. Looks like she has left the Dhoom 2s and the Robots behind her. She has come back to roles that mean something even if they don't make for great films. She has come back to some causes, like girl-child fetocide and drug abuse, even if they aren't well-placed in the context of the story. It is a good restart. And I would say that even if it were a film-made far worse. So starved are we for roles that mean something, more so for the lead lady.

Because had he gone to a conventional desi college, he would certainly have known how to play the game of ‘spin a yarn’ effectively.
Shaad has disappointed by not encashing the opportunity that the mighty Yash Raj banner presented to him. Patchy storyline, lackadaisical screenplay and an overdose of theatrics have completely killed the movie. Add to that the not so great music score from Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, and you have a half-baked, mediocre chitrahaar called Jhoom Barabar Jhoom.
The saving grace in the movie comes from Aki Narula, the Costume designer and Abhishek Bachchan the actor (in that order). The costume donned by Big B is quite impressive, as is the distinct look given to Abhishek; though I wonder if Amitabh would have done this role had his son not been there in the movie. Lara Dutta gives a steady performance, but Zinta babe and Deol puttar are clearly below par.
A word on Abhishek’s performance: he has shown remarkable comic timing and doesn’t look wooden anymore in facial expression or dance movements. His look has been well worked at and it is sad that poor direction and a poorer story would deny him the adulations that he would otherwise have received.
Ayananka Bose, the Cinematographer has done a steady job, but then you simply can’t opt for the movie because of its Cinematography. Of late, there has been a plethora of movies showing Western locales (KANK, Ta Ra Rum Pum, Cheeni Kum) and therefore there isn’t any novelty left in the way foreign locales are picturized. So never mind the Eiffel Tower or the Waterloo station or indeed our pride Taj Mahal, you would not miss much if you give this movie a skip.
Shaad Ali’s fetish for the Taj though leaves a stale taste in the mouth…apart from the ‘Taj for Sale’ sequence in Bunty aur Babli (where present-day UP’s CM Mayawati was lampooned as Phoolsakhiji), he had picturized the ‘Chup Chupke-2, chori se chori’ song using Taj as backdrop. In JBJ too, a reasonably long (and therefore irritating) sequence is picturized, using portions of the song ‘Bol Na halke halke’ as well.
Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy have largely disappointed, and barring the title track and the mellifluous ‘Bol Na halke halke’ (rendered by Rahat Fateh Ali & Mahalaxmi Iyer), the tracks sound monotonous and jarring.
The Editing by Ritesh Soni is just about OK, and barring the climax, isn’t too great. 
Vaibhavi Merchant’s Choreography also fetches her pass marks, and that is rather disappointing because the scope for her was tremendous. She has given repetitive steps to Abhishek, which was avoidable. Worse still, she has made a good dancer (Bobby Deol) look average. I wonder if this was done deliberately at behest of the now powerful Bachchans, just like Big B was made to look the weak dancer in K3G’s ‘Shaava Shaava’ by Farah Khan as the behest of Shah Rukh Khan. 
In a nutshell, Jhoom Barabar Jhoom is a David Dhawan type of movie and should be watched only if you endorse the ‘dimaag nikaal ke dekho’ school of thought. Since the promos of the movie are a few leap years ahead of the full-length stuff, I suggest that you shouldn’t strain your time and money on this flick and instead be happy with the promo.

Else, who would've thought John Abraham would make me laugh with him?  But that happens only when he is not preaching philosophy or flitting like a butterfly (I shall NOT elaborate). Anyhow, every once in a while, he and a few of the others have ""quote of the day"" type lines which deserve and got a cringe and a few more. The others actors did well only because of the banter-type lines that go between friends. But, Anaitha Nair and Alishka Varde fit in perfectly as the kind of girl-friends I'd like to have, spirited and always bring a smile! Pakhi on the other hand, doesn't necessarily ooze charm. But it's just refreshing to have a non-glam, non-wannabe-size-zero as the female lead. She has to play a character she has written, Mishka. While I don't know whether that made it easy or difficult for her, I appreciated that Mishka grew as a woman and wasn't defined only by the men in her life. Also thematically, it was a delight to see an inclusive attitude towards the homosexual community. Not only were there non-trivial gay characters, Mishka is also shown going ""aaawwww"" for a fleeting moment in a song when she sees a lesbian couple. Heartening beyond measure. Besides that and other close-to-life, normal characters, the script ranged from random sub-plots to uninhibitedly absurd. There are characters and they have stories, but their motivations are unknown and their actions unjustified. There's the girlfriend who doesn't seem to care but is supposedly in love and there's the friend who doesn't want to marry the guy she's in love with. When nothing comes of these sub-plots, they look like mere props in the grander scheme of things. In fact, that is partly true of the main character, Siddharth, as well. The film makes you wonder whether he or his friend, Omar know when (let alone why) he falls in or out of love? Then again, maybe that's cool too, because that is a mere reflection of the confused 'gen x'?

Alas, doesn’t make you laugh, think or connect with the characters because it stays superficial. ","I admit that I start out with wanting to give smaller films a benefit of doubt. I settle in my seat with a strong urge to like the film. Jia Aur Jia saw my urge die with every passing minute. Just because a film philosophizes about life and death, just because it has two women who don’t know each other take a road-trip together, just because it is a small film – does not make it a good film. Unfortunately, brooding doesn’t equal insightful philosophy. A road-trip isn’t automatically fun. A small film still has to either engage, entertain or enlighten. A lot in Jia Aur Jia is ‘for effect’. There is very little that feels organic to the story. The two lead ladies are diametrically opposite personalities as if they were written in a tabular format. Jia1’s column listed ‘chirpy’, so the Jia2 column had to be morose. Jia2 has businesswoman-like mannerisms and dresses accordingly. Therefore, Jia1 has to be nomadic from head to toe and within. One smokes, thus the other won’t. And so on. Similarly, the situations in this road-trip story are ‘for effect’ too. The crazy Jia has to do the standard crazy things. Not so crazy, is she then? The sane Jia is the insane one who is looking out for different ways to commit suicide. Her thoughtful expression is truly irritating. Pensive characters who are reflecting into space are annoying, not mystical. Characters who steal for fun come across as silly, not zany. The only redeeming feature is Kalki Koechlin’s performance as the supposedly fun Jia. The Jia who is overtly shallow but is sorted. It feels like she is earnestly performing CPR for a film that is on its deathbed. It is difficult to say if Richa Chadda is emotionless or if she comes across as such because her character is ruminating through the film. In effect, her Jia is annoying. Again, her character is overtly thoughtful but has no real depth. Even so, the film would have worked as is, if there was some chemistry between the two. There is none. In fact, it seems like they are in some sort-of a competition with each other, but that too is half-baked. Arslan Goni’s character spouts philosophies like an irksome, all-knowing, full-of-himself youngster. His act comes across as an effort. In fact, all three seem pretentious in their own way. Through the film, all three characters carry enormous emotional baggage. This could have been explored, sliced and diced. But, it is just narrated off as a back-story without adding much to the character they are in present time. Even at 90 minutes, Jia Aur Jia feels a little too long. The dance number, where all three actors seem extremely uncomfortable, is force-fitted. Similarly, the montage of Jia1 moments that Jia2 has seem like a last-ditch effort to lengthen the film. All those scenes were less than an hour ago in the film, the audience certainly didn’t need a reminder. All those moments were about a week ago in the story, Jia2 certainly didn’t need a flashback. Another montage with alternating shots of the three characters jumping into water and baking in the sauna seemed like a mindless addition. The dubbing too had an echo. So, through the film the actors sounded like they were talking in a dream sequence. And just in case you thought pretty places like Sweden don’t need an effort from the cinematographer, you’d be mistaken. They have managed to make Sweden look drab here. How I wish that were the only shame. Jia Aur Jia is full of things that ought to have been done better for hardly any of those elements have anything to do with the budget – most of it is a lack of heart in the writing.

It has no material to invoke any kind of emotion from you. Except maybe for a few unintentional laughs.,"One of the most annoying things about films that aren't working for you is the genre switch they tend to make through out the film. Did the writer/director want to make a romantic film? Or was it a thriller they were shooting for? Or was it a psycho's story they were trying to narrate? Or did they wish to comment about the system that we are a part of, which is rotting from the very insides? Or was their intention to have steamy scenes featuring a real-life porn star, trying to see how far they could push the envelope?Jism 2's jerkily shifts from one to another without any attempt at keeping a smooth flow. And this is no directorial/editorial experiment we are talking about. The movie goes about narrating whatever little content it has, with all the time in the world and there is no fast-paced, quirky cuts. It is slow and it is mostly boring. The romance is laden with some mumbo-jumbo philosophy. The thriller doesn't manage to engage you too much despite the potential that a Robin Hood-ish protagonist has. His psychopathic inclinations seem out-of-place because we are not entertained to his life experiences, motivations or perception. A monologue at the end of the film is hardly something to suddenly get us interested. And as far at the steamy scenes go, you've seen pretty much all, if you've seen the trailers. Unless you call heavy-duty heaving a part of body language which contributes to acting, Sunny Leone can't act. She barely has any screen presence in terms of captivating our attention by her presence on screen. Arunoday Singh and Randeep Hooda try their best to emote, but this is just the wrong film. And whatever they do ultimately feels like they are overdoing it. Everything in frame looks just so fake and forced. The emotions, the relationships, the connections, the attractions, the power, the anger, the helplessness. Then you are left with hollow dialogue to fill you in with what might be happening. And that is exactly what the words sound like even they seem like they are trying to make some profound sense. At other times it is just inane. On the other hand, I wasn't expecting much from the film either, so it was just a question of sitting through it and waiting for the slow proceeds to be done with.

So, they are supposed to be smart and yet they fall for whatever it is they were intended to fall for. Beats me! Theoretically, there is always at least one thing nice to say about a film even if you hated it. That usually comes in the form of dialogue - which we’ve ruled out - or basic plot or situations or acting or at least the music. But, na-ah! It felt like I was watching a school play where the teacher said, happy means :-), and angry means :-| and sad means :'( and all of this can be said with flat dialogue delivery. No voice modulation necessary. The music sounded generic though some of the lyrics were decent. Note the word 'some' there. At other times, the lyrics were trying to be cool with words like disc and CD thrown in. Anyway, it's not like you were going to go watch the film just for its lyrics. There were these fleeting things which I thought was pretty sweet for such a superficial film. One was where a character says, ""I used you because I could."" Another where a character forgave another for a blunder because they wanted to forgive and not because of some melodrama was emoted their way. These two were pretty insightful things for characters to say and do. So much so that they actually seem accidental in this set-up. Yet, nothing about Jo Hum Chahein is average enough to watch even if it's playing on TV. Skippity-skip!

496,594,594,594,594,Jobs,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/jobs-review/,,,,3.15,"The first big screen adaptation on the life and times of Steve Jobs can only be described as a disappointment. By not knowing what to include and what to exclude, director Joshua Michael Stern and writer Matt Whiteley fall way short of capturing even a bit of the essence of the legendary Apple founder. Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs is earnest, but doesn’t quite do full justice","There is no escaping this undeniable truth; if you use a personal computer or a smartphone – no matter what the brand or the operating system – it means that your life has been touched by Steve Jobs. And those are just two of the many, many fields of technology, innovation and creativity that the man has had an indelible impact on. Considering his charisma, the phenomenal graph of his story, the anecdotes and myths that surround him and the sheer legend that he became in life and in death, it would seem that making a terrific biopic on him would be a breeze. Well, apparently not.Joshua Michael Stern’s screen adaptation of the life and times of Steve Jobs is a bit of a mess. A superficial account of one of our most iconic contemporary figures, it proceeds like a soulless, humourless recounting of some key incidents and moments in Jobs’ life, without ever pausing to give the viewer even an ounce of insight into what actually made the man tick; what drove him to push everyone around to churn out their best and innovate, not electronic gadgets, but life extensions.Yes, Steven Jobs visited India early in his life, started Apple Computer in a garage, was forced to quit the company he co-founded and then returned in grand fashion and turned it around to make Apple the most valuable company in the world. Stern and writer Matt Whiteley seem to have said to themselves, “We know all this. Let’s just make a film!”When you even read, hear or talk about Steve Jobs, you’re usually enthralled, impressed, confounded and inspired. It seems so strange to think filmmakers, with every audio-visual tool at their disposal to evoke emotions from viewers, can fail with a character that, through countless experiences of its life, seems tailor-made for not one but multiple screen portrayals.The key problem with Jobs is that of the choices – what to include in the film, how to treat it, how the narrative must be structured – it seems like none of these were paid any thought or attention to. Like the rest of us, the makers of the film assumed that Steve Jobs himself would power the film through. Clearly, the film subtracts from the great man, rather than adding to his persona in any manner. Considering how Ashton Kutcher was always a suspect choice to play Steve Jobs – he’s never really been able to break away from being Kelso – he was about the only thing that at least makes you wait till the end of the film. His physical transformation is remarkable, even though he doesn’t nearly capture the essence of Steve Jobs. His expressions – pursed smile, pursed frown, pursed everything – do give off the impression that he was trying too hard to ‘be’. That becomes even more apparent with his gangly gait that is often shown in the film. Every other side character in the film is merely functional. Kutcher earns the film some brownie points, but nothing can take away from the fact that Jobs is one of the most disappointing films in recent times, particularly considering the fact that I actually was really intrigued by the trailer of the film. The good news, of course, is that we still have Aaron Sorkin’s version to look forward to. Perhaps the person most disappointed with Jobs would have been Steve Jobs himself. For someone whose key mantra was innovation, his description of the banal treatment of his life story would probably have been the one word he always seemed likely to say. Sh*t.

497,595,595,595,595,Jodhaa Akbar,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma reviewNotepadPreview48 Critic Reviews 3.3/5.0 8 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/jodhaa-akbar-review/,3.3/5.0,3/5.0,,2.7,"Painstakingly made but painfully long. The history and politics is interesting but the teachers seemed to be in a rush to cover the course material. What we do know now though, is romance 450 years ago was same as it is now. It is a visual treat nevertheless.","I am not exactly a fan of qualified opinions - especially with opinion on movies. Either you like it or you don't - no if, no but, only ""mut"" (opinion in Hindi). In a 5-star scale, Jodhaa Akbar certainly deserves 3, but that would translate to ""Wait for DVD release"" here. And what a waste it would be to have you do that with such a beautifully shot movie. However, after spending half of the 200+ minutes on mostly mundane romance and the other half on interesting yet dissatisfying display of politics, I cannot tell you it is a must watch. Either catch it in theaters or skip it completely. Meanwhile, suggestions for a descriptive rating to go between the second-last and middle rating are welcome!Jodhaa Akbar can be clearly divided into two parts - the political saga and the romance between the royal couple. It is also obvious that the romance is the prime focus of the narrative. Hrithik Roshan (Emperor Akbar) who is chiseled to fit the handsomest mould and picture-perfect, Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan (Queen Jodhaa) are wonderful in their scenes together. You get your dose of Chemistry along with History and Geography. But, I would say that it is largely due to the time given for that chemistry to develop - for the curiosity to become respect to become love. And here we hit the circular argument; the time taken is the biggest culprit. The movie is unjustifiably long.In these often heavily clichéd romantic scenes, the law of diminishing returns kept cropping into my mind. In any movie in general, every extra minute beyond the 120-minute mark yields lesser enjoyment than the previous one. Unless, unless ... you have an extremely captivating story to tell, or you are telling it in an extremely captivating manner. I need something more than glittery jewelry and costumes, bright reds, oranges, and yellows, and fantabulous sets to keep me from fidgeting. Something more natural, something less made-up. And get this, here the interval is at 120 minutes!The romance is pretty dull. From the bedroom tiffs to the mistaken identities - nothing is new or handled in a creative way. Especially appalling is the way the mother of all misunderstandings takes shape - a speech delivered in the most monotonous fashion by Ms. Rai-Bachchan. The sole scene that might stand out is the sword fight between the two. All-in-all this romance lacked Bhuvan-Gauri's innocent charm or Mohan Bhargav-Geeta's elegance.On the other hand, the political drama, including the dialogues, was extremely interesting, - even though most of it is a voiceover delivering a lesson in history. All credit to the history teacher, Amitabh Bachchan - listen to how the voice softens when it talks about Jodhaa. Some of the political situations are executed really well too. The reactions of various Rajputs to Akbar's orders is a fine example. Another highlight of political dramas is the language used. Both Urdu and Hindi are used beautifully, especially in the political sequences. At times the same dialogue was repeated once in each language. It sounded like an enchanting jugalbandi of the languages.Unfortunately though, these are treated as mere sub-plots to give a break to the mushy-mushy happenings in the main story. Most of the side characters are underdeveloped and thus one-dimensional. It seems like the director is simply fulfilling his duty by filling us in on the political environment. To watch Akbar become a crowd-pleaser with just one act of kindness is unconvincing. If this one action is supposed to be symbolic of all such actions he must have taken, then it is extremely dissatisfying. More instances of Jodhaa being the light that guides Akbar's soul would not have harmed. And of course, lack of time cannot be an excuse now, can it?The war and action scenes are an integral part of the entire drama. While other battle sequences are rather repetitive, the first one has some exquisite camera work and background score. Some of the fast camera movements have an awesome 3-D effect (okay, almost!). The silences add to the drama as much as the drum rolls.The Rahman-Gowariker duo usually churns out some wonderful music. And if nothing else they are a spectacle. But, here I felt let down. Only towards the end of ""Khwaja"" did I realize that all through the song they were trying to build Akbar's character. To show how he can be mesmerized and go into a trance. Till then, all I could do was empathize with the giggles around me looking at mannequins wearing clay-pot-look-alike hats and attempting a puppet dance. ""Azeem-o-shaan"" is brilliant more because of the crowd and the aerial shots rather than the choreography and use of color. We've had much better from both A. R. Rehman's musical sensibilities and Javed Akhtar's pen and imagination. Mr. Gowariker, how about leaving the melodrama, the ""almighty solving all problems without any input from humans"" syndrome to the Barjatyas? How about letting Ekta Kapoor reign the ""salt-pepper"" kitchen politics? So, we can block that out of our systems just by name. Surely there must have been more to the saas-bahu equation than that! Cannot thank you enough for sparing us the triple action repeat cuts, though. A thousand salutations to N D Studios, magnificent sets! But how about leaving that to the Bhansalis of the world? What's the point if you can't focus on what you do best - narrate a story, reach out to us?

There are a few moments where you begin to hope for chemistry between the lead pair only to see it fizzle away into a ridiculous story. ,"Jodi Breakers has the right mix of ups & downs, moments - insecure & 'aawww', comedy, that define a relationship. Unfortunately, it spends all its energy in just getting from one to the next which makes the whole story look functional rather than involved and connected. Similarly, the actors too look like they are keeping a one-arm distance from their characters. Except for one moment, R Madhavan looked like he was trying to justify the decision to cast him, and he looked extremely uncomfortable opposite Bipasha Basu. And this is despite the fact that he looked comfortable with his non-hero-like body and the story used it well too. One could call it a restrained performance, but Bipasha Basu, didn't look like she wanted to go too out of her way to emote. And yes, I'm one of those who believe that she can. As a natural outcome then, the 'chemistry' they were forcing themselves to invoke looked mighty unnatural. Not that there is anything very natural about the basic plot line - Sid (R Madhavan) makes a business out of separating couples who aren't getting along too well with each other. And separate them he will - by hook or crook. Therefore, having a manipulative mind is inevitable and he takes a liking to Sonali (Bipasha Basu) because she is even better at coming up with manipulative ideas to kill a relationship. When I first saw the trailer of Jodi Breakers, I assumed at least some portion of the film would be spent on how creatively the twosome break marriages apart. But, nothing of the sort, the one or two cases that are shown in a tiny bit of detail are outrageous. In fact, they aren't too creative about the type of reasons that couples want to break up either. It's either cheating or the mother-in-law. That's it. The second half of the film isn't even about the breaking-up bit. It almost is a second film with another story at its center, except that we are carrying minimal baggage from the first half. In 30+ years of watching films, I've never been able to understand how easily people fall in and out of love and how willingly some characters forgive others who have wronged them in the most unimaginable way possible. Jodi Breakers is another film that can be added to that list of question marks. But, I guess, it is expected that a good cine-goer will forgive them. Oh, just like those characters! Aah... Yet, there were some moments in the second half that looked like they'd evoke some emotion out of me. But, they remained half-hearted, half-baked. And it's sad that a romantic film cannot stir you. Same goes for the comedy parts as well. Except for a couple of well-timed one-liners by Omi Vaidya and R Madhavan, the film barely kept me from smiling. I guess I should be thankful that I didn't have to cringe too much. On that note, let's bid adieu to another rom-com that misses the mark by a mile.

It turns out that none of them is expressed with any conviction. Not that I am asking for long lectures or powerful drama, just an engaging tale would do. John Day, like the trailers promise, starts off with very fine suspense. Three-four threads run parallel and keep you guessing. The connection is elusive, yet not so out of reach that you lose interest. It all blends in together well too. But, along the way, the various themes John Day tries to reach out to become one too many for its own good.Also, it takes itself way too seriously. Sure, any humor would feel completely out-of-place, the grim texture of the film makes it out to be much more important than it really is. The story doesn't really warrant a film over two hours. Not like it's a surprise, it is Naseeruddin Shah's performance that keeps the audience going. Yet, with a character that has barely any shades there is only so much he can do. Fortunately, he does get able support from Randeep Hooda who broods all too well. The downer, of course, is we've seen Naseeruddin Shah do so much better and Randeep Hooda do the nasty bit already. I actually liked Vipin sharma's performance too. Elena Kazan though stuck out like a sore thumb.In fact, the entire romantic track between her character and Randeep's lengthened the film way more than their chemistry warranted. On the other hand, the give and take between Naseeruddin Shah and Randeep Hooda too is hazy. The dots don't connect. If you are interested enough to, that is.There are a few pretty gory scenes which seem like they are exist more to shock than to add inherent value. Similarly, the themes of child sex abuse and parental pressure seem to be forced in rather than blending in. It is a boon then, that there are no song and dance routines added to the mix. But, the background score did seem a little confused between horror and thriller. Besides the decent performances the cinematography and a few cynically witty lines are your meager takeaways from John Day.The need to be thrilled shall have to wait for the next one that claims to be a thriller.

Any specifics that I would like to talk about will contribute to you knowing a bit about the movie. And that would be a crime in this genre. So, here is my attempt at being as unambiguous as possible.This movie will be talked about a lot for the stylish homage the director pays to the people/styles of movie-making that have inspired him. And for a good reason too. The beauty with which the tributes have been interwoven with the narrative is not something one should write or read about. It has to be watched and applauded.

Neil Nitin Mukesh is quite flat in some scenes, but overall, he has grasped and enacted the nuances of his character really well. For me, Vinay Pathak was the show stealer. In general, the versatility of this actor is just incredible!Dialogues - my disappointment with this area might have more to do with the expectations set by the first 15-20 minutes of the movie. The general mysterious tone set in the beginning is missing at certain points later on. Especially, in the climax, keeping the dialogue enigmatic would have had much more impact. But, I am sure it was a balance the director must have struggled with - leave it to the audience to decipher or spoon-feed them. What impressed me the most was how much I enjoyed the movie despite being a little dissatisfied with the two main departments of the movie - the two most visible ones. Though acting and dialogues are not necessarily the selling points of a movie in this genre. Just goes to show what a long way treatment of material can take a movie.

It keeps things simple despite the seemingly complicated situation it gets itself into and it is clean. If you don't mind some childish fun, wait for the DVD release. And if you do, you are better off skipping it.","Joker is not your typical Akshay Kumar action-comedy. It starts of being and looking silly, stays so and ends up even sillier. But this is not the regular slapsticky comedy either. It is cute silly. The characters of the obscure village Paglapur have their quirks as you would expect, but they react consistently with their character without getting too repetitive. And the repetition is mostly enjoyable.A lot of the repetition being tolerable has to do with the perfect length of the film. At a good 15 minutes less than two hours, Joker is just right to make the goofing about acceptable. The complete absence of toilet humor and innuendos feels so fresh in a product like this. But that is what Joker's humor is not. The humor that it does have too, is pretty situational and induces hearty laughs.Unfortunately, the humor fizzles out as Joker turns its focus towards the story. While trying to literally bring Paglapur on the map, the story that Agastya (Akshay Kumar) and company cook up goes out of control. Which would have been fine for the genre that writer, Shirish Kunder wants to keep the film in. But the fun fizzles out and the characters start focusing on the logistics of when and how.While, logistics and logic are welcome in any story, in the fantasy world of Paglapur – where the nights are lit with lanterns made out of fireflies – they distract you from the fun. Not that there is any consistency in logic through the film – for example, a village so remote that it has no power supply, but has electricity to light up the village like it's Christmas not to mention has mobile and internet connection. And oh, this dot of a village is not devoid of item numbers - Maharashtrian ones at that, bang in the middle of the Hindi belt.  It is such things that were so easy to take care of and would have added an additional layer of humor. And this inconsistency with sudden focus on the dry story that pulls Joker down. Else, I'd have shocked myself by actually liking this one. As is, I am a little surprised to think of the film as 'not bad'. Especially if you think of it as a film for children that adults can go to, too. The storyline involving aliens and such is not only  in the kid zone, the commentary on Indian politics might also be quick education for kids on what's lined up for them in years to come. Except for the item number, of course. The story in fact, does come across as a bunch of kids sitting around playing, ""make a story"" where every child in turn contributes one line to a story that is built right there as the game progresses. Joker is fun in that kind of a way. Also, Joker does have a lot of other social commentary and analogies thrown in for us to notice. Moreover, this is the rare chance for us to watch Akshay Kumar not play himself but  stick to his character. While it is much too serious a comparison, his character reminded me Mohan from Swades. There are no histrionics, no slow-mo entries, no glamour, no super-hero attitude. He plays plain and simple Agastya who's conscious suddenly wakes up to do well for his village. The rest of the cast has Shreyas Talpade playing one of the most hilarious characters. And this too is well-served by use in appropriate measure and not overdoing it. The other men bring in their laughs too – from Vrijesh Hirjee to Asrani. The women on the other hand have precious little to do and the film could have pretty much done without their characters.They together form this fantasy land, Paglapur, which might as well have been Lilliput from Gulliver's Travels. Unfortunately, it doesn't end with the same dose and style of humor as it starts with. And the story is childish while trying to maintain an adult interest in it. A little bit of neither here nor there and yet a welcome change from what we have come to expect from a Akshay Kumar film.

But unfortunately, it isn't able to create a crisp environment. Perfect actors can't make lame defence & prosecutors into a good courtroom drama","The mindset is such that you hear of the Boman Irani-Arshad Warsi combination and you expect a ""laugh out loud"" comedy. It doesn't help that the trailer points you in that direction too. It pleasantly surprises you, by starting off as satire, quirks and all. Then it takes a serious route, and even so, you are willing to play along because Jolly LLB seems like its trying to make an important point. Unfortunately at the end though, it is pretty disappointing.The disappointment is not as much because of the decision taken by the court, but due to lame defence (Boman Irani) and prosecution (Arshad Warsi). They seem rather clueless and caught unawares all the time. Sure, some benefit of doubt can be given under the name of character consistency. After all, the defence is callous, over-confident, arrogant and thus complacent. The prosecution is amateur and confused about his moral stand. It is also possible that we have been spoilt by smart-Alec lawyers in our filmy courtrooms and real life lawyers are not really always on their toes. But, after this leeway too, the stage doesn't look convincing enough. If real-life is what we are aiming for, some things work out way too easily. Like a bribe drops down from 5 lakhs to 1 lakh without much back and forth. Or evidence is pointed towards, out of the blue. So on and so forth. And I sincerely hope lawyers and judges don't have shouting matches in real-world courtrooms.This overall inconsistency and ultimately flat drama pulls Jolly LLB down and takes a lot away from the satire it started out as. The pull towards gravity though meets constant resistance from the cast. How wonderfully subtle and underplayed both Boman Irani and Arshad Warsi can be when allowed to. No, over-the-top histrionics, characters played out as haughty and simple-minded respectively. Saurabh Shukla too gets a role weighty enough to play around with. While a caricature, his act as the twisted-but-straight-but-twisted judge is something you won't forget easily. His maneuvers over the defence are by themselves worth a watch - thorough 'babu' style. All of this with no help from the dialogue. A mockery of dialogue within the film by calling lines 'filmy', doesn't make it any less filmy. It makes the lines neither filmy enough to applaud nor real enough to be believable. Further distraction is caused by songs that don't belong. And why is this 'promotion' song during end credits becoming a norm?Jolly LLB feels like it was undecided between satire and drama. It looked like the heart was in the drama, but a few satirical moments came by and went through in the film. That didn't make the satire bad, it just made the film uneven and took the focus away from the story - which in itself was wrapped in drama that was neither dramatic nor real enough.

Won't stay for too long after though. ","On the surface, it'd look like Jolly LLB 2 has Akshay Kumar do something different from the norm - relatively fewer songs, lesser drama than we'd expect, make it seem different. Soon enough though, we realise that the common man/police officer (be it from Singham, Dabangg, Rowdy Rathore, etc) who takes on the system is replaced by a lawyer. Even so, the drama, the back and forth between the two lawyers and the ever-entertaining judge in Saurabh Shukla keep you interested through the 2+ hours.That's not to say, every minute is engaging. There are many scenes that stretch longer than necessary. They are usually at emotional turning points in the film. However, those extra seconds spent to underline the drama, take away from the impact. The courtroom drama too goes back and forth borderlining unbelievable every once in a while. But, that could just be to bring in the dreariness of the court room to the theater. The unrealistic bit is, of course the satire, intended to keep things light. Like they say in the film, you have to smile because you are in Lucknow. The satire within the court room works. However that outside the room, seems a bit much, even if it is hilarious. I am referring to a cricket match here. Or even the other wink at women power through Jolly's wife (Huma Qureshi). The rest of the writing conveniently bounces back and forth between the two sides of the case, keeping things interesting, but not entirely unexpected. What took me by surprise is the performances. They are not overboard. None of them were subtle, of course. But none were intolerably in-the-face. Each actor, be it Saurabh Shukla, Annu Kapoor or Huma Qureshi, owned the screen when they were on it. Akshay Kumar (Jolly) on the other hand merges with the background – in a good way.  Even if I discount my bias towards “stars” who tone their stardom down, Akshay Kumar makes you believe equally his helplessness and his over-confidence despite some very filmy lines. The State vs. Jolly LLB 2 is worth the time you spend watching it. Whether or not it is worth the energy spent in going to the theater and back, and the extra multiplex bucks will depend on your affection for Akshay Kumar, satire, courtroom drama and so on.

But over the years, I have realised the core of why I don't like them. I don't find people insulting others, funny. And a lot of Judwaa 2's humor relies on exactly that. Insult the obese, insult the colored,  insult the women, insult those with speech defects – to name a few. I am sure the intention is not to insult but to bring laughs. But that insults bring laughs is a premise I have never understood. Then there are other things like a child is made to objectify women. Now, sure there might be societies where this is encourage or kids pick this up and no one finds anything wrong with it. But, a child artist was made to do it, was taught to do it – isn't that irresponsible of us as adults? That we are expected to find it funny is even worse. Yes, it bothers me even if it is that one child. Because that child got called 'cute' for doing so. Of course, I am not supposed to think too hard. Therefore, there is no effort to have a story at all.  Other than the set-up and the climax, the rest of the film is is just about the misunderstandings due to mistaken identities between the twins – Prem and Raja (Varun Dhawan). These misunderstandings just seem to be on, on repeat mode and get tiring despite all the mustered patience. After all you are being asked to sit patiently and brainlessly through awful Shah Rukh Khan impersonations, disgustingly designed mens' toilet booths, and Varun Dhawan switching between the film's definition of good boy and bad boy. He performs well within the context of the film but the film itself has little respect for any kind of performance. It is one which makes Sachin Khedekar go over-the-top matching Upasna Singh syllable-to-syllable. And you know, they both have to be loud because they aren't together in a single shot, they have to reach the other through the scenes. Tapsee Pannu seems so uncomfortable as she tries to dance and trot around in clothes that she can't carry in front of the camera, that it feels like she is rushing through her dialogue out of nervousness - as if making up for her almost mute character in Pink. Jacqueline Fernandez plays pretty prop again. I can't remember a single film where she has done anything other than that. It is almost as if you can copy-paste her parts from one film into another and no one could tell the difference. Speaking of copy-paste, a few shots in the 'Ganpati' song, especially the chorus seemed like they were shot only once and just repeated to beat. This kind of cheating is like adding salt on the wound for a viewer who isn't enjoying the movie in the first place. For instance, there is little logic when a doctor tells new parents of twins that when one child cries or laughs, the other will have the same physical reaction. The film has this happen conveniently and not through the film (thank goodness for the flawed logic). However, that the parents interpret this as when one falls weak, the other will be strong had me stumped. And it is not even a scene that warrants this statement. But, when did the doctor say that? Didn't he say the opposite? Or maybe this was a comment on how a patient/parent/human being hears what they want to hear and not necessarily what was told to them.Yep, it is time to sign off.

Eons have passed and yet we aren’t sure whether the response is for the signature pose or the mere appearance of the mass hero or the wonderful build-up to the fitting coda. But, when Allu Arjun (the mass-hero of Julayi) comes into the frame as suddenly as a dog crossing the street, we are left with none of the three factors to cheer for the mass-hero. However, the past master that he is, director, Trivikram compensates for that by conjuring an enticing bank robbery as the next scene to show the acumen of our beloved hero.Julayi, its mass commercial formula notwithstanding, is the story about the clash of intellects. While the protagonist is an impatient youth, who can't wait to climb up the ladder of riches, the antagonist is a self-conceited criminal. While the former tends to bend any rules to achieve his dream, the latter exudes passion for his art of robbery. What binds them together though, is their willpower and unorthodox and yet street smart brain. With such an alluring concept, Trivikram starts off as a crazy entertainer with some wonderful witty lines thrown in - dialogues have always been Trivikram's strong hold. Unfortunately, as the game progresses, the dialogues become its own shackle in the incoherent script. Where there should be riveting action & pertinent lines, there is exorbitant action & brimming lines. Not just that; from the songs & their dance sequences to the overzealous comic relief portions to the exaggerated de-glamorization of Ileana D'Cruz (the love interest alias dream girl), every other ingredient thinks itself as the talking point of the film and eventually irritate us.The problem with Julayi, is not the lack of idea, it is the overabundance of it without proper packaging – a pre-requisite for these kinds of movies. It is easy to say Julayi isn’t a good movie, but with enthralling set-pieces springing up now & then it becomes really hard to lose hope on the movie; albeit these highpoints aren’t promising enough to say the movie is fairly engaging. In the end, Julayi true to its name turns out to be an aimless wanderer, meandering over a lot of wonderful things for the sake of being a masala caper, but ends up being a poorly mixed cocktail.

507,605,605,605,605,Julie and Julia,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/julie-and-julia-review/,,5/5.0,,4.85,"I recently watched a Saturday Night Live clip of Julia Child’s television cook show, where Dan Aykroyd does a lousy imitation of the chubby, lively chef. I can say this because after having seen Meryl Streep play Julia Child in Julie & Julia, you absorb much of her mannerisms and charm. The film delves deep into the characters of Child and food blogger Julie Powell and makes you fall in love with them. ","You know the kind of cook shows that make you want to regret you had some mix veg nothing-ness for dinner? The kind that makes you forget you couldn’t pronounce the French dish that is being cooked because it looks divine? When I first heard of Julie & Julia, I thought the movie would make me feel just that - a nagging concern about where my life is going and why I’m not a successfully chef. Or at least a salivating regret on why I didn’t have something more creative for dinner. The film is based on the lives of two women - an autobiographical texts by Julie Powell (played by Amy Adams), a hum-drum government employee who takes on the challenge to cook 524 recipes from Julia Child’s book 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking' and Julia Child’s life from her first cooking class to publishing her book. Both women in their own way admit that food saved their lives. The film draws parallels between the 1950s, when Julia Child (famous American chef, played by Meryl Streep) first started taking cooking lessons in Paris, and the early 2000s when Julie Powell’s life changed with her super taxing challenge. We are made to see the similarities with both their lives even though they belong to different time zones and social brackets. Julia Child moved to Paris with her husband, Paul Child (played by Stanley Tucci) a plush government employee who is supportive of her zest to do something with her life – and not just play a domestic companion to him. Quite similar to Child, Powell decides her boring government job is pulling her down, especially since her friends have all climbed the ladder to success. She lives with her husband, nonchalant yet supportive Eric Powell (Chris Messina) above a pizzeria in Queens, New York. Her one year challenge, as you witness through the film, lifts up her life to extremes. She writes a blog about her daily accomplishments, and it becomes hugely popular. The cooking, however, is taxing. You are made aware of the pressure mostly because the film keeps cutting back to Julia Child’s inspirational story of how she became a successful chef. The parallel narratives work well with these two stories, as they stand similar and contradictory in many ways. Both women fight with vastly different demons: Julie with her financial situation and job coming in the way of her aspirations, and Julia with the social mindset against women in Europe in the early 1900s. Women cooked at home, and we see Julia Child breaking that stereotype by standing in a room full of men, and a skeptical tutor, and making her own. Yet both women are searching for the same thing: a validation of their talent. Meryl Streep as Julia Child is a delight, but of course. You immediately choose your side, when you decide her side of the story is a tad bit more interesting than Julie Powell’s. Amy Adams though, makes Powell’s character a lot more endearing and relatable. Both husbands are shown to be extremely supportive of their wives career, but somewhere down the line, the characters get boring. I would have preferred more refined characters, especially since Nora Ephron (writer and director) decides to delve deep into the personal lives of both women. The DVD of Julia & Julia has a bunch of really exciting extras. First up is a featurette titled ""Secret Ingredients: Creating Julie & Julia"", in which we get to hear bits of the real Julie Powell and Julia Child’s niece. We also get an overview of the production, and might I say, you can never get enough of Meryl Streep on screen! She’s such a charm; you just want to keep watching her perform. A part of me wishes the film focused on making the viewer drool over the food in the film. Most food related shows/movies/books end up making you feel either hungry or inspire you to cook. I felt neither during Julie & Julia, maybe because the focus was on the womens’ trajectory and less on what was being cooked. While the performances are the main straw in Julie & Julia, the film surprisingly doesn’t make you want to cook or eat. It makes you want to sit back and ponder on the women and their achievements. That’s a real win for the film, isn’t it?

508,606,606,606,606,Jumbo,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewPreview11 Critic Reviews 3.0/5.0 3 Reader Reviews 2/5.0,/movie/jumbo-review/,3.0/5.0,2/5.0,,3,"With a dearth of good Hindi movies in this genre, this one might as well be what kids deserve this holiday!","In absolute terms Jumbo, the baby elephant will keep kids good company. But relatively speaking it doesn’t have the zing of The Lion King or the wit and sensitivity of Finding Nemo, two movies the plot seems to have tried to combine.On the look for his missing father, Jumbo loses his way and is torn apart from his mother too. What more can a child identify with? Separation from parents - the biggest fear and the most traumatic nightmare imaginable. Going ahead too, the plot is not treated with kid gloves. It stays pretty close to dark. That makes it a kids’ movie that respects the target audience’s intelligence even if the subtlety is not noticed by them.And yet they need the fun and energy, which I think is missing. That kids might not miss it at all, is a completely different matter. The story doesn’t have anything new, but then kids love repetition. And hey, it is, in fact better than the alternatives produced in recent times. So, it all depends on what you are comparing it too. There are enough on either side of the scale and Jumbo stands pretty much in the middle. Same goes for the animation, it wasn’t entirely appealing. Elephants with long legs, wide eyes, and out of proportion trunks were not pleasing to watch, even if it was only for 90 minutes. Same goes for other animals sketched out. I liked the concept of elephants in multiple colors though. A comment on how the species stays united despite the variation in skin color?In my mind voices of characters are done well, if I have to try hard to recognize the voice - it seems familiar but I cant spot it because of the modulation. So, when a Gulshan Grover does a Gulshan Grover and Rajpal Yadav and Asrani too play themselves, I find it mundane if not annoying. On the other hand despite the tremendous publicity Akshay Kumar and Dimple Kapadia got, they sounded like supposedly-cute elephants would if they could speak. Their inflections sounded convincing.On the Hindi animation scene for kids, there isn’t much happening - especially non-mythological. In that sense, it is good to have Jumbo dubbed with the right amount of star value. But otherwise, there isn’t anything remarkably different about the story or the animation.

509,607,607,607,607,[The] Jungle Book,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review25 Critic Reviews 4.8/5.0 9 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/jungle-book-review/,4.8/5.0,5/5.0,,4.6,Become a child. Take your kid(s) along.,"From the first frame you are taken deep into the jungle where a pack of wolves and a panther are training a man-child to be as much like a wolf as he can be. The pace doesn't drop and neither does the quality of the 3D. What makes it even better is that the story keeps you with it even though you've known the outcome for years. Very rarely do you see grim color schemes in animation films. Even though the situation is gloomy and characters are in mortal danger, animation films usually have a chirpy set of colors to make the danger seem far away. Jungle Book breaks this norm and you see lots of grays and browns. In fact, the end sequence is set completely in the night. And no this is not because of the usual bad projection usually associated with 3D. I can't say it makes things look real, but I can say it makes things as real as animation set in fantasy can get! The sprinting deer, the long, dry grass, the fruits hanging off trees transport you to the middle of the action. Of course, there are logical glitches like any fantasy would have, “How would Mowgli know to use his 'tricks'?”. You explain it away, “He is human, he is smart.” “How do the animals know water can put out a fire?” You shrug, “it is fantasy”, you explain away. A certain emotional connect is lacking too but the nuances in the animation more than make up for it. In fact, it always amazes me about well-done animation – the facial expressions, the body language far surpasses many a live action film. This is also after considering that we do give an unsaid discount to animation. If you thought Mowgli and you were deep in the woods at the beginning of the film, you will discover the density of the jungle only better as the movie moves along. The dense forest, the scenes with Kaa and King Louie are just plain and simple mind-boggling. Once the animation is under the movie's belt, the voice enacting and Neel Sethi's (Mowgli) performance are just perfect. You root for Mowgli and not only because we are his people. Bhaloo's good-natured manipulation makes you laugh and King Louie is as adorable as he is meant to be menacing. Sher Khan has a streak of wanting the good under his meanness. Characters made interesting by they own shades of black and white.The film flows along smoothly from one scene to another. But, in some of the fast-paced chase sequences, a few edits – a fall from one rock to another; a swing from one branch to another - are rather badly done. Yes, yes, they are few and far between; and they pass by too quickly to leave a mark.The Jungle Book enthralls with its technical expertise and with its story-telling too. One of those films that takes you back to your childhood and becomes a lovely memory for today's children.ps. I saw it in English.

510,608,608,608,608,Juno,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/juno-review/,,,,4.6,"Written by blogger and former stripper Diablo Cody, Juno is like an extremely hummable song. The kind that gets stuck in your head and you find yourself constantly amazed at how the lyrics are so apt for your life. Juno is a brilliantly subtle film, written like a simple story just waiting to be told. ","Juno is one of those films that make you forget that you’re watching a film. I detest labels, but Juno is an indie film at its best – with subtle characterization, an endearingly refreshing soundtrack and a film with a basic agenda to just tell a story. And it’s no wonder that Juno won the Academy Award for the Best Original Screenplay in 2007. After watching Juno, you won’t be left with an over-powering cinematic feeling. You’ll be left feeling like the character Juno in the film yourself, in a simplistically relatable way.Juno is about a 16 year old quirky girl (played by the remarkable Ellen Page) who is wiser beyond her age. She decides that her sexual curiosity has reached its peak and in order to satiate her, um, “questions” she chooses her best friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). Unfortunately, she finds she is pregnant, and this film begins here. There’s no over-dramatic love-making scene - what you remember from the 30 second glimpse of the two making love is that Bleeker’s mouth tasted of Orange Tic-Tac – and it’s what Juno remembers most as well.The film is broken into the 4 seasons, corresponding to Juno’s trimesters. Juno decides she wants to give her child to deserving parents – the candidates are played by Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Gardner). Each character is almost pitch perfect, be it the adoptive couple, or Juno’s sassy parents played by J K Simmons and Allison Janney. You can really see where Juno gets her quirkiness.  Juno is an extremely engaging film for many reasons – driven by a pure story, characters that make you want to rejoice and a childlike visual texture that just brightens the screen. But mostly, Juno’s strongpoint is its simplicity. What’s obvious is how the film doesn’t make the whole abortion debate a bag of drama, and deals with it as Juno's experience. But beyond that you realize just how toned down it all is – every relationship that is determined by minute observations and every scene that expresses itself through dialogue that makes you feel like an inquisitive eaves-dropper. The DVD of Juno has some interesting features: a crackling audio commentary by director Jason Riteman and writer Diablo Cody. The commentary is funny, insightful and talks at length about their interpretation of Juno’s character. Even here, the discussion isn’t pointed towards the social debate about abortion, or pro-choice. The gag reel is hilarious, filled with profanity and each actor pulling the other’s leg. It’s the kind of humour you can see translate into the grammar of the film.
There are 11 deleted scenes, and each one make you wish they were included in the film. I even tried it out where I would put it, and how it would then flow. When was the last time you remember doing that with deleted scenes? I would suggest every one of you to first buy the DVD, but also get hold of the entire extended soundtrack of the film, which unfortunately is not there on the DVD. Each song is so emblematic of the film; one quirkier than the other. And yet they merely breeze through in the film, almost like a wasp of cool air when you pass by an air-conditioner. But if you had to point to one thing in the film that stands out among the rest, it would be Ellen Page’s performance. All of 20, she plays an eccentric girl full of back-slapped one liners and a bag of repartee, but even so, you just want to hug her. You can’t miss Juno!

511,609,609,609,609,Jurassic Park 3D,Owner's Pride!,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/jurassic-park-3d-review/,,5/5.0,,4.6,"Steven Spielberg’s epic that was ‘65 million years in the making’ is back in theatres, this time in 3D. This is your chance – relive magic of the kind rarely seen in or even imagined in cinema.","In over a quarter of a century of my unflinching and passionate romance with cinema, I’ve only ever jumped out of my seat once, in reaction to the goings-on in a film. That was two decades ago, in 1993, during what was one of the earliest movies I ever watched on the big screen and my first Hollywood film ever – Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park. Today, two decades later, it happened again. The film? Jurassic Park in 3D. And once again, I jumped during the exact same scene that startled the bollocks out of me as a naïve and impressionable 7-year old.Indeed, as I saw frame after frame of grand vision after so long, all those childhood memories of experiencing true magic for the first time in my life came gushing back; movies had always fascinated me even before Jurassic Park, but there in front of me were magnum frames of the kind that I hadn’t ever seen before, not even when, less than a year earlier, I watched Amitabh Bachchan, standing in the deserts of Afghanistan, thunder, ‘Mera naam Badshah Khan hai!’Whether the 3D re-release of the film was called for at all is a discussion for another day. Now that the film is back in theatres, it is time to celebrate the film and the man who made it. Who can forget those iconic shots and scenes, like the first time Sam Neill, who plays a paleontologist, a man whose life has been devoted to imagining what dinosaurs must have been like after excavating their skeletons, spots a real live, walking and breathing dinosaur, a gigantic brachiosaurus, in front of him. Or those terrifying scenes where the T-Rex escapes its paddock in the nighttime, unleashing its terror on two unarmed vehicles, one of them with children in it. Or that scene with the velociraptors in the kitchen. Unforgettable moments of cinema history, which were brought to life because of the visionary conviction of Steven Spielberg.Yes, this time round, I couldn’t help noticing how broadly the characters have been painted. The simplistic manner in which they observe and react, the predictable side track about Sam Neill’s reluctant paternal instincts, the manner in which Laura Dern’s character is shown to break gender stereotypes, Jeff Goldblum’s manic naysayer with a roving eye or even the great Richard Attenborough’s kindly eccentricity; all of them seem too vanilla – something Spielberg has been accused of throughout his phenomenal career. But with this one, critics can take a hike – this film is for those wide-eyed little ones with imaginations that us adults left behind years ago. As I keep saying, it is sheer movie magic, created with spectacular technical wizardry.If there is one thing Hollywood deserves credit for, it is ambition. They’ve time and again pushed the limits of scale, vision and VFX in cinema, sparing no cost in attempting to achieve the impossible. Yet, so many years since Spielberg’s cult blockbuster made hair, all across the world, stand on its end, I believe they are yet to surpass what was achieved with Jurassic Park. And yes, even if you aren’t the greatest fan of watching films in 3D, this is one film where the 3D never hurts the eye and adds great depth to frames; enough, at least, for you to not mind the glasses at all. So if you watched the film in the theatre years back and loved it, or if you have children who’ve never watched the film, or if you yourself have never watched it, or if you have parents who haven’t watched, or – well the list is endless, I suggest you visit or re-visit the film in theatres. You may have aged, but Jurassic Park has not.

If only there were a couple edge-on-seat plot points.,"I am so tempted to repeat the first paragraph of the Raees review. It truly is heartening to see actors, who we associate with a certain type of cinema, do something slightly different. Just that bit is enough for me to not complain about them not breaking the mould completely. Kaabil might not be the best thriller out there, but it surely keeps you wondering, “HowHeDunnit”. And that bit doesn't disappoint.Kaabil reminded me a lot of  Aankhen. It had to, right? And I have this strong feeling that some plot points, if not all have been inspired from elsewhere. The tone of the film from the beginning kind of gives away how things are going to go with our hero. Also, the film spends a good half of the film on the couple but doesn't leave an emotional tug. These two things put together make Kaabil a little underwhelming.Nevertheless, the curiosity about how it is done takes you through the film. Also, Hrithik Roshan  is angry and sad more than being all goody-goody. When he does the latter, it usually gets annoying in the first few minutes. This could be why Yami Gautam and he don't make your hearts go all mush despite capable execution by Yami Gautam. The aggressive bits, Hrithik Roshan does much better though and that works for Kaabil. Ronit Roy and Girish Kulkarni add to this intensity by being the bad men that they might soon be stereotyped as. The songs jar and the item number thrown in for good measure distracts from the seriousness of the film. However, Sanjay Gupta does control himself in the editing and camerawork department. There are no unnecessary quirks or choppy cuts which add to the films intensity. While the dynamics of how the thrill is brought about are written well, the  main character's transition bothered me. On the other hand, it has always bothered me when films have a common man, who is disappointed by the system, take matters into his own hands. So, that would make me reject half the films in this genre, right?In that sense then, Kaabil is a worthy watch. Despite all the ifs and buts.

513,611,611,611,611,Kaakan,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/kaakan-review/,,,,4.033333333,"Age-old melodrama disguised as period romance. An interesting idea stretched too far and spoiled by directional flaws. It’s visually pleasing in parts, but the narrative is tiring for the most part.","A strong idea and great story certainly play a big part in a fine film. But these alone cannot ascertain the quality of one. A good motion picture (or anything good for that matter) is rarely a coincidence. It’s rather the fruition of gripping vision and decisive execution, besides loads of other factors in varying degrees. Of course, there can be exceptions. Sometimes a story fascinates you so much so that its weaknesses hardly make a difference. Such an exception cannot be made for Kranti Redkar’s debut feature Kaakan however.Split over two different periods unfolds the heart-warming tale of romance, faith and companionship. But surprisingly, this isn’t Kisu and Sudhamati’s story alone in the first place. It is as much the story of other principal or trivial characters. Each one of them has their own story to tell and each story could be a standalone movie. Every now and then Redkar brings forth  some sort of background story to these characters. This is done to bring in a poignant touch and make you empathize with them – nothing of the sort ensues though.Since each character emerges hero and their stories heroic, subplots tend to distract your interest from the main drama at times. The problem here is that the whole thing is spoon-fed through redundant dialogue. The director prefers informative tricks over visual impact, taking the easy way out. With little narrative novelty, the screenplay lacks subtlety and insights. Logical connections to certain events as well as sequences overlook deliberate thinking.Kaakan is a beguiling idea, but sadly that remains only at a basic level. It is riddled with endless loopholes and mediocrity. But the problem doesn’t end here. Rather it starts off from there, ultimately floundering in what it sets out to do.Jitendra Joshi’s bogeyman image among kids sounds funny, but poor characterisation ensures that you feel nothing about his worsened conditions. Even so, young Kisu is far more stirring and impressive than the older one. The outcome of flawed direction, he suffers from inconsistent portrayal, as does Urmila Kanitkar’s Sudhamati or Ashutosh Gaikwad’s Gopi. Though not directional masterpiece, the scenes involving Joshi and Kanitkar are compelling than the whole film itself. Rest of it highlights Redkar’s negligent approach. Over the period; the characters age, but their props don’t – be it Sudhamati’s ribbon or kaakan or even the inside of the tin. By the looks of it, Kisu seems to have had his special haircut and makeup done. Sloppiness in hair & makeup is as much a concern as is its writing and visualization.The music though stands really strong when everything else fails. It intensifies the film to a point, until its overuse fades the dominance away in the longer run. Foley sound effects and  faulty dubbing add to growing failings, making it technically weak. Not that it’s an offence to make another love story along standard lines. But one should at least be mindful of where and when to draw the line. Not only does Kranti Redkar fail miserably in the writing department, but she also comes across as totally clueless wearing the director’s hat.

Kaakha Kaakha is worth a watch for Menon’s directorial mark and for it’s unadulterated story-telling. ,"Kaakha Kaakha  (remade in Hindi recently as Force is another story that surrounds the idea of vendetta, but it manages to stay with you well after the end of film because it is treated in a manner that makes an instant connection. Gautham Menon uses many clichés in Kaakha Kaakha: good versus evil, how opposites attract and the eternal celebration of sacrifice but it’s his racy script, Surya’s crisp performance and Harris Jeyraj’s music that makes the film an investing watch.  I remember reading an interview (and I read a lot of them, courtesy my  obsession with Surya) which mentions the first spark between the two flew during the filming of the song, 'Uyirin Uyire' and it was such a passionate film schedule, they were married before they knew it. Of course, I had to buy the DVD, and after watching the film I was left with the same feeling – a story that had me so involved, with it’s simple plot but earnest display of emotions, I’d forgotten that I spent well over 2 hours watching a film. Unlike Force, Kaakha Kaakha doesn’t resort to many gimmicks - (No beefed-up hero picking up a motor-bike and throwing it like a strawberry and the likes). It’s a gripping plot, played out with a sense of ease and with the genuine need to tell a story. Anbuselvan (Surya) is an IPS officer, working in the Narcotics Department of the Police force and for as long as he can remember he has been on the right side of law.The film begins with a team being formed, headed by Anbuselvan to break the Narcotics rackets across the city. Special training is being undertaken for this mission – all of which is shown to us in well-cut montages. Just before this you are given the peg of the film – he’s a stern officer with the advantage of not having a family or emotional responsibility. When he meets Maya, as an audience you instantly know what his plight is going to be. Maya (played by the beautiful Jyothika) is a middle-school teacher and as opposite to Anbu as can be, with all her charm and radiance. While this is a run-off-the-mill opposites attract pairing, you forgive this cliché because their chemistry is almost contagious. While they explore their relationship (through a few songs, his resistance to give into his feelings, her naiveté against his professional life and the dangers involved), you are also secretly hoping that their love won’t come in the way of Anbu’s high-risk job.The film picks pace when Anbu has to fight to keep his relationship out of the spotlight with Pandya (played by Jeevan), a mafia-gang leader who cracks Anbu’s weakness. While this premise is enough to grip you, unlike Vidyut Jammwal in Force, the villains in Kaakha Kaakha  aren’t as menacing as would have been apt. Especially considering Surya’s brilliant performance as Anbu could have done with an equal opposite force; a threateningly psychotic character would have brought out Anbu’s plight much more. However, Gautham Menon makes up for this with absorbing action sequences. It’s a fresh change to see that a romance angle, in an action film, hasn’t been forced for the sake of entertainment but has been duly justified in the plot.A few songs and characters were out of place, like Maya’s friend or Anbu’s fellow officer, but mostly you would be better off watching Kaakha Kaakha over Force. It’s far more earnest, the chemistry palpable and performances impressive (Jyothika’s a lot more tolerable than chirpy Genelia). Besides, Surya is way better eye candy. The DVD of Kaakha Kaakha has no features, while the subtitles were apt and synced (I could make out with my broken understanding in Tamil that the translations were rather literal). Mostly you should invest and buy the DVD because Kaakha Kaakha is a pleasantly watchable film – it isn’t flawless or a masterpiece but it has an extremely investing narrative.

Otherwise, it is two ordinary stories that go well enough with a madcap one. The quirky situations and lines bring a few smiles. ","Is it three stories or is it none? There’s so much happening and yet so little. That is the kind of screenplay Kaalakaandi has. When taken individually, only one story is different enough to get you interested. Fortunately, it is also enough for you to watch all three stories without getting bored. The performances though are excellent through and through.Down to the character artist with the smallest role, each actor seems just so comfortable in their skin. As if they were given a character sketch, the approximate lines and the liberty to do what they wanted within the context of the scene. It is sheer joy to watch each character in control. Saif Ali Khan comes off with some classy comic timing. It has been ages since he has seemed so much at ease, almost like he is telling us, I don’t care if this flops, I know I am doing my best. Nary Singh show what who plays Sheela brings a smile, the kind of smile the depiction of transpersons or prostitutes never brings. Kaalakaandi – approximately means messing up – has three stories, each one having characters who land themselves in messed up situations. In some sense, each of these stories is about how the characters manage their consciences after the mess-up. And yet the film doesn’t take itself too seriously. From use and abuse of narcotics to a respectful attitude towards transgender prostitution to the regular double-crossing goons to repeated jaba at policemen and the law and admin system to cancer – Kaalakaandi maintains a light yet insightful vein. A lot of the dialogue is in English and a lot of the Hindi is cuss words. The abusive language does come across as “for effect” at times. But, like real life, you just automatically ignore and focus on the other content of the film. And thankfully there is enough to enjoy too. The VFX while cheesy is quite amusing. It’s not the creative best but each time it is unexpected, even though you know there is a pattern for the visuals. Similarly, the music while not outstanding goes well with the sequences in the film. Films with multiple threads aren’t new and yet they tend to create an energetic vibe about them. It is clear that one or two of the threads are weak and the stronger threads are bearing the burden. Yet, when done well, it can be pulled off and that’s how it goes for Kaalakaandi. You see the weaknesses, but for the two hours you see through them.

With gratingly bad performances and a poorly written script that doesn't quite know what to do with its noble intentions, the film's greatest redeeming quality is that it ends.","Subhash Ghai must first fire his casting director. Then he must think long and hard about whether he has anything truly worthwhile to say through his cinema. And then he must think about whether he has what it takes to say it.Kaanchi, his self-proclaimed magnum opus, is an abomination of a film, despite having its heart in the right place.

And of course, it is always good to see an actor like Chandan Roy Sanyal let himself loose and have a good time.But neither does Ghai's latest discovery, a young girl named Mishti, have the acting chops to pull off the role she plays, nor does anyone apart from Chandan Roy Sanyal do anything that comes across as much better than the sound of screeching nails on a blackboard - and that includes fine actors like Rishi Kapoor and Mithun Chakraborty - who're made to look like clowns and caricatures.The film attempts to show the power of a woman with will; it attempts to show how our country has always been held back by the corrupt men in power; it is pretty much a David versus Goliath tale, where David is a woman. As I said, the film is certainly well-intentioned.Set in a small hamlet in the hills in the first half and in the big bad urban world in the second, the film follows innocent young Kaanchi as she suffers and then fights against those who were responsible for her misery. But shoddy writing - always a problem with Ghai's films - quite simply makes the film an ordeal to sit through; its monstrous runtime adding to the viewer's woes. Subhash Ghai comes across as an old-timer trying his best to tell a contemporary tale. His language is clearly of the days gone by, even if his story attempts to be contemporary. You see this instantly, when you have the leader of a young political party that wishes to take on the system, stand on stage and sing a part-rock, part-masala song with lyrics that sound like 'Jai Ho' (or Jaya He, perhaps).And with Kaanchi reacting in unlikely ways to unlikely scenarios, you can't help ask yourself just what Ghai was thinking. You never quite feel for her, because everything comes across as too made up, too easy. Kaanchi's struggle should make you weep for her. Instead, you wonder how a little village belle manages to outsmart so many rich and powerful people with ease; essentially it is a screenplay with far too many leaps of faith for you to take it seriously.As the film drags on and on until you've had enough, you almost feel thankful to see the end credits. You also wonder why this thought hasn't yet crossed Subhash Ghai's mind: ""Even Sachin Tendulkar has retired. What am I still doing?""

The difference is that today the protagonists are not as idealized as they were then. When the lover is captured, the beloved, instead of running pillar to post in the political corridors, seeks solace elsewhere. The lover too is not sweet and docile. He exhibits strong biases and does not treat the beloved right.It is not the first time that Mani Ratnam has attempted flawed characters. Alaipayuthey (2000) presented a close-up of marital discord due to differences that become clear as the honeymoon period gets over. Irritability is a common flaw he seems to imbue his characters with. The same is deep seated in Varun a.k.a VC, Kaatru Veliyidai's male protagonist. He exhibits self-centeredness and flares up quickly and frequently. That's fine, it makes him real. However, is real always interesting? No. And that's where the film lacks. Varun and Leela are real, yes, but also predictable because they are crafted on an age-old template of binaries: male= macho and hot-tempered, female = deal with it!To reduce the predictability, the film uses flashbacks with intercuts between the present and the past, which instead of helping, just delay the unfolding of the love story. ""Come to the point,"" you feel like shouting at the screen. And yet, side-by-side you hope that there will be more to it -- more play in the structure, more depth in characters, more twists and surprises, but there exist none. There's nothing to hold your interest apart from the picturesque locations and pretty faces, and a promise that it is a Mani Ratnam film – that he will jolt you somehow and that it will all come together at some point. Sadly, that moment never arrives.I am surprised to see him not being able to exploit the beautiful setting, the sex appeal of his gorgeous looking lead pair, and even the music of A. R. Rahman - to create something profound and ethereal. Such beautiful ingredients but the recipe tastes stale. What went wrong?Well, other than the stereotyped versions of Mars and Venus, the story got overcomplicated by the choice of its setting--Kashmir, Kargil, Indian Airforce, Pakistan, etc. The plot could have worked anywhere else, why exactly was it set in Kargil, I couldn't comprehend. It seemed to have only distracted every creative department from prioritising the dramatic core of an otherwise potent theme.Then, Leela's character must have appeared very strong on paper but on screen, she is nowhere near the person she may have been visualized to be. She is pretty, independent, and has the acumen to handle medical emergencies, but why is she so feeble? Why does she give in? Moreover, while Varun's brashness is indirectly justified through various anecdotes, Leela is treated with utmost apathy. She is reduced to VC's muse in spite of having so much to her.Such reduction of the female character is definitely a big drop in Mani Ratnam standards since Roja. And, even with the freshness of sharp cinematography and clean production design, Kaatru Veliyidai reeks of patriarchal thought, while pretending to superficially talk against it.I won't recommend this film. Unless you are a hardcore Mani sir fan and are interested in traversing the journey with him, do not watch!

But, equally surely it can be used in better films.","Kabali was always going to be 100% about Rajinikanth's super stardom. It was going to be about his action, his style, his persona. The character Kabali would be designed to suit that purpose. Unfortunately, it doesn't blend well at all with this attempt at “gang war with a heart”. I shudder as I say that maybe a star vehicle like this is better off without a story rather than having botched attempts at drama and emotion under the garb of action. It makes just every thing seem forced - even the action, even the supposedly “cool” lines. In fact, even Kabali's catchphrase is outright lame. It all boils down to Rajinikanth's delivery to make it as stylish as he possibly could. And yet it doesn't work. Other than that then, he plays his suave best. One scene in which he is overwhelmed by emotion stands out giving you a glimpse of what the actor can do despite the star in him.The rest of the film is only to serve the over-arching purpose called “Rajinikanth”. In that too, Radhika Apte tries to hold her ground. You can tell she is trying to blend into the genre but can't help herself every once in a while. The other members of the cast overdo everything with shrills. It becomes repetitive and annoying.In its own way it is a boon that the focus is never too far away from Rajinikanth. At least the target audience is happy. Though I must say I heard a couple of them restless for the interval. The second half had enough emotional mumbo-jumbo for even me to hope that the next double-crossing was around the corner. I was looking forward to the audience hooting at Rajinikanth's swag to keep me smiling for 2.5 hours. But, that didn't quite happen after the first five minutes of his expectedly stylish entry. I wonder why. ~ ~ ~*It is cosmic intervention that this movie is the 1212th one in the wogma database. Or maybe it is just the Rajini force.

The literally breathtaking cinematography and the casually witty dialogues come only next. But, the target is very obviously the multiplex audience since a good part of the movie is in English.A serious political topic has been very craftily treated with humor. And it is not making fun of something or laughing at anyone, it is very situational. But, since all the messages are very subtle, the overall product ends up needing a certain punch. In fact, only the people who have seen the previews will understand the tongue-in-cheek humor of the last joke in the movie. The aim is to give a human face to the journalists, the Taliban, the Afghanis, and the Pakistanis. Now, how much of it is true, only people living in Afghanistan and Pakistan can tell, but the whole set-up looks very plausible. A good-humored cameraman (Arshad Warsi) and a somber journalist (John Abraham) get together to find the story of their life in Afghanistan. They are accompanies by a frustrated Afghani (Hanif Hum Ghum), who drives them around. The threesome find a dutiful member of the Taliban (Salman Shahid) and a bonus – a beautiful American journalist (Jessica Beckham). There is no boy-meets-girl routine. It is about how these characters spend a few hours of their life together. Watch out for yet another hilarious performance by Arshad Warsi. Kabir Khan actually makes all the characters look like they are from a slice of life. Their make-up, the lines they are given, the way they deliver them, the dialect, everything contribute to making the audience believe that they are for real. Only a talented director can neatly outline characters in the first few minutes of screen-time and keep them within those boundaries for the rest of the movie. This, of course, results in profanity and a documentary-type feel to the movie. But, remember this is a documentary with the backing of Yash Raj Films, so good money has been spent on the technical aspects. There is something about expanses of sand that is very pleasing to the eye. It is amazing how the dusty brown needs no other color to make it look prettier. Add to it, now and then, the backdrop of snow-topped mountains and we begin to agree with one dialogue that is in the trailers and translates to, “What did these people achieve by destroying such a beautiful country?”

520,618,618,618,618,Kadal,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/kadal-review/,,,,3.6,"A film that I won’t dismiss outright, but one that I couldn’t help feeling disappointed by, Kadal is way short of Mani Ratnam’s best. There is enough to like in Kadal, but the film fails to truly draw the audience into the world that it is set in. Mostly because of inconsistent writing and editing, Kadal underwhelms. ","The saying that a film is written twice – once on the writing table and once on the editing table – has been used and abused more often than is completely healthy. Yet, the experience of watching Mani Ratnam’s Kadal is fraught with moments where you are reminded of this uncompromising theorem repeatedly. Enough, at least, to make the most ardent Mani Ratnam zealots like myself wonder if the great man’s heart was really in this film in the first place.Set primarily in a Christian fishing village, Kadal is tale of love, faith, revenge and loss. An incident in a seminary between two men leads to an enmity that lasts a lifetime. Years later, caught in the middle of this saga is a young orphan Thomas, who is essentially a wanderer – a boy whose choices, and hence destiny, hinge on the beliefs of these two men standing at opposite ends of the spectrum of faith.The film, armed with an interesting premise, a legendary director and a slew of experienced and accomplished technicians, is at best a patchy effort – let down mostly by the screenplay (co-written by Mani Ratnam himself) and the editing, by his long-term collaborator, A. Sreekar Prasad.Be it the narration of the story itself or the emotions that the scenes and situations intend to convey, the graph of the film is highly uneven. Strange, because Ratnam and Prasad are both masters at designing a narrative; at weaving situations together without dumbing things down, while not forcing viewers to make generous leaps of faith either. A number of their previous collaborations like Kannathil Muthamittal, Alaipayuthey and Aaytha Ezhuthu come to mind. Making matters worse is the runtime of the film, a whopping two and three-quarters of an hour. Also, for a film named Kadal (which means ‘sea’), the most striking void I felt when I walked away from the film was how even the continuous presence of the sea in the film didn’t affect me emotionally or even visually. Intended perhaps as allegory for God – the sea, after all, is as all-consuming and unrelenting for sinners and yet as all-embracing and omnipotent for those seeking redemption, as faith itself – it fails to create the connect that viewers so desperately need while involving them in a story with universal values but with a highly local flavour.A. R. Rahman’s refreshingly haunting soundtrack for the film helps to some extent; it stays with you long after the film. However, the manner in which most of the songs were filmed left me disappointed as well – 'Adiye' and 'Nenjukulle' in particular. Again, extremely strange, considering Mani Ratnam’s particular expertise in picturizing songs. Rajiv Menon’s cinematography, while slightly uneven, is largely an asset because of some enchanting frames. Undoubtedly a tough film to shoot, it manages to retain the gritty, rustic feel of the village without ever compromising on the contemporary look and style of the film.Kadal marks the return of Arvind Swamy after a long hiatus of over a decade, and the man hasn’t forgotten how to act. His calming, serene presence adds an unquantifiable and undeniable measure of stability to the film, anchoring it throughout. The return of a veteran is complemented by the debuts of two star offspring. Gautham Karthik’s unconventional, scruffy look suits his character Thomas, but he still has some distance to cover in the emoting and dialogue delivery departments. Even so, Kadal is a good debut for the youngster. His love interest Beatrice is played by Thulasi Nair, who looks pretty, but is also still quite raw as an actress. The nearly three hours I spent in the theatre had me almost frozen from start to end. As an ardent film buff and a student of cinema, I was left alternately in awe of the director whom I look up to more than most Indian filmmakers, and at the same time, disappointed because for perhaps the first time ever, my emotional and cinematic connect with a Mani Ratnam film was sporadic at best. The mastery is still there, no doubt, but I couldn’t help feeling that Mani Ratnam’s heart just wasn’t into it this time round.

But, alternating between showing life in a village and telling a story, Kadvi Hawa manages to pace itself too unevenly to create impact. ","The opening sequences of Kadvi Hawa exposed my affinity to the colour and texture of dry, desert sand. The aridity is gorgeious, to the extent that I can smell it. Maybe it is the Rajasthani blood – for I haven’t ever lived in Rajasthan. Or maybe it is because I am not a farmer who suffers at the hands of drought. This is the kind of insensitivity Kadvi Hawa aims to point an accusatory finger at. Unfortunately, it spends too much time in showing us the village life that the intense, human story has little space to take hold. Kadvi Hawa treats the intense tragedies of drought and floods with the same aloofness as city-dwellers would treat it, “Yes, we know there are problems. Yes, they are grave. Yes, they require attention. It’s sad, very sad. But, they are not our problems. We have our own.” And it is quite human to do so, right? That is exactly what Hedu (Sanjay Mishra) and Gunu (Ranvir Shorey) do too. To alleviate themselves from their misery, they are okay with taking down someone else. But, each one has an extent to which they would do so. Both of them, stop short of going all the way. And this is brought about beautifully in the film.Alas, all this happens only in the second half. The entire first half is spent in setting up the scene for us. Look, they have no electricity. Look, they have no schools. Look, they have no water. Look at these other people, they have too much water. Look, the government is spending its time in sweeping macro changes when little is changing at the ground level. This would have all worked really well, had the story gone on along side. While the mute, still non-movement of the film had its own charm, it didn’t work for the film. And this treatment is a mystery because the story had so much going for it. The things people on both sides of the story were doing to stay afloat by itself was engaging. While one came across as mean, as an audience you could understand where they were coming from. Mechanisms of how loans worked and how deep the problem came across quite starkly too. These hard facts actually make you identify with the characters who are ultimately good people that have strayed away by their circumstances.Well written characters have been performed well through and through. Kadvi Hawa is not at all a dialogue heavy film. A lot is therefore left to these performances. Tillotama Shome, ironically brings life to a woman’s submission to her situation. So effective is Sanjay Mishra’s act that after a bit, you don’t even realise that a person with sight is playing blind. Ranveer Shorey’s character is in a dire situation himself but you don’t feel like empathising with him because of the spot-on performance. Even the mute Bhupesh Singh has a presence about him for the few scenes that have him. Just by its presence in the dialogue, the wind comes across as a character in the film. Hedu might not know the science behind how the wind works but he knows the wind is what makes and breaks his life. He is in fact, nostalgic about the wind that brought him the seasons because the winds today have made his life bitter. I am not too sure if this film works as a message on climate change because it shows only the effects and stays mute on the causes. I guess those are for us to ruminate over.

An experience that might seem incomplete if not watched on the big screen. ","Kahaani is a film that I'd just urge you to watch. You want to watch it for the story, you want to watch it for the character BVidya, you want to watch it for the actor Vidya.
Yes, it means I want you to drop reading this review and begin booking your tickets in the next window. Not only because Kahaani is a 'must watch', but more because I fear I might spill the beans. Any word I say (or not say) might give the film away and I'd feel extreme regret if I was instrumental in giving anything away that the makers have so beautifully guarded. Thus far. But Vidya Balan is something we CAN talk about. The lady just makes it difficult for you to pick a favorite from amongst her films. She just adds on to the list. Her character's vulnerability is indistinguishable from whatever the actor might have felt. So stressed is the pregnant Vidya while looking for her husband, that you want her to relax while saying, ""orre orre, shaant-shaant, nai to baby ho jobe"" (""relax else you might deliver"" in whatever broken Bangla I know). And this is in the first ten minutes of the film. Your emotions towards her get only more sensitive as the film progresses.For a thriller that solely rests on the shoulders of a woman character, Kahaani does a brilliant job of exposing just that little amount of material to both move the story forward and to keep you interested. It teases you, the seasoned thriller viewer, along the way too. But mostly by hook and sometimes by crook, it keeps you wanting to crack the puzzle. The smart writing took me as a viewer through a roller coaster ride in just one moment. A moment, a twist when I felt cheated. You know, how you engage in a thriller and you want to feel smart about yourself by deciphering the mystery from the material given to you. And then the writers pull something out from thin air and you are left sulking and feeling deceived. Kahaani has that one moment, but soon enough it recovers. It gives you enough justification that you don't feel like that big a fool after all. Sorry, but saying anything more would be unfair to the makers. In fact, merely naming the genre of the film is giving away a little more than the makers intended to, if the trailers are anything to go by. Interestingly then, while the editing and the background music stay true to the edgy theme, the pace of the story never gets too quick to disconcert. Similarly, the rugged, sordid texture of the film isn't something you'd associate with a thriller. Even more interestingly, the mismatch is either not noticeable at first watch or it doesn't seem to distract. You end up enjoying Clinton Cerejo's background score as you pick up R. D. Burman's popular songs from yesteryears, some of them in Bangla. In equal measure, you notice the quirky editing especially in the first 10 minutes - they'll put to rest any doubts you might have about the genre. Speaking of genres, Kahaani produces one moment of romance that entire 2-hour films dedicated to the genre aren't able to create at most times. Same goes for the couple of times it makes you laugh too. The rare humor blends in very well given the serious topic at hand. Kahaani also has a couple of insightful moments where comments are passed on the prevalent system and you wonder at their truthfulness, righteousness, politically correctness and the debate they open the subject up to. It might sound like Kahaani has it all tragedy, comedy, drama, romance. And it does. Not to mention one of the few times (first?), a mainstream Hindi film's camera has romanced Calcutta. But, it's all gentle and fluid. You are looking at it throughout the two hours and yet you don't realize it.

But, unfortunately it isn't a tight thriller nor does it have an unpredictable story. ","As suspected, the thriller bit is toned down a lot in Kahaani 2's story. This is despite the pulsating air the film carries about it. Even for a simple thing like a missed morning alarm (at the beginning of the film), the background music runs as if it is building up to the final stages of the big reveal. Yet, despite all the prompting by the music, the story doesn't make the heart race because what comes about is more or less expected. This predictability doesn't work for any story, even less so for a thriller. Sure, it wants to create awareness about an important issue. While it may feel like the issue is weaved into the story, whenever characters go into “talking about it” mode, it becomes evident that they are talking to us as the audience and not to each other. Having said that, one scene between Vidya Balan and little Naisha Khanna had me stunned. I couldn't move because the direct attack on the topic was unexpected and liberating. Even tied in with this video we made a few years ago. (Warning: Content of this video might give the movie away.) It is one of those movie moments that will stick. Of course, if it were not for Vidya Balan who spoke as naturally as any responsible mother would to an appropriately repressed Naisha Khanna, the scene wouldn't have been half as effective. But, that Naisha Khanna, the child actor, had to do such a scene where she confesses something that hopefully hasn't happened to her in real life - again raises a question about the ethics of child actors and the roles they play in some movies. I was waiting for the day I could use a word other than “furniture” for Arjun Rampal's act. Even if his personality is too polished for the gritty surroundings of a run-down police station, his facial expressions have moved to the next level. It is time now for body language and voice modulation to play a role too. I am sure with company like Vidya Balan, it is only a matter of time. Same goes for Manini Chadha. Vidya Balan herself makes being worried look like such an easy thing to do. She teases the audience exactly like the writer-director wanted her character to – building the suspense and suspect just right. The casting of the “villain” is spot on. Especially considering its consistency with the point the film wants to make. However, the two big reveals are totally predictable - the worst that can happen to a thriller. Beyond that then, the voiceover and flashback methods used to show the audience what happened is rather painful. This is where the baggage of the director's last film's success weighs in. You don't expect the extent to which these routes are taken. You don't expect there to be any real-life self-referencing in a film by Sujoy Ghosh, even if it's subtle. And thus you end up cringing a little more than you would when it comes about in a film where you expect it. Even so, Kahaani 2 isn't pulled down by expectations as much as it is by some lackluster writing. There are no real twists to speak of and the most of the other part of the story feels like an “awareness campaign” rather than scenes in a film.

524,622,622,622,622,Kai Po Che,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma reviewPreview47 Critic Reviews 4.5/5.0 5 Reader Reviews 4/5.0 159 Tweet Reviews 4.6/5.0,/movie/kai-po-che-review/,4.5/5.0,4/5.0,4.6/5.0,4.366666667,Kai Po Che is sketchy yet engaging. It is abrupt and half-baked but the performances and music alone make the film worth a watch. The rest is taken care of by the close-to-home themes.,"It's been a while since I thought a movie needed to be a little longer. Not necessarily because I was having a very good time or was thoroughly engaged, but because I wanted to see more of each of the characters. Every time I was involved with them, I was moved on to the next episode. No emotion was allowed to sink in. Yet, what the story is trying to convey, and the performances make for a certain one-time watch - if not in theaters, at least when it is out on DVD/TV.It is very likely that my need to know more about the characters springs from having found them interesting in the book, 3 Mistakes of My Life by Chetan Bhagat. The book has a little more about each of them, especially the side characters. On the other hand, they weren't well-fleshed out to start with either. So cutting out from what was already little felt rather sketchy.It was quite an ordeal finishing the book, but that's mainly because the language is too plain-speak. His words can get tiring with their lack of flow. (It doesn't help that I took it upon myself to read the book again before watching the film.) Yet, I admit, Chetan Bhagat does have interesting stories to tell, even if they are outlandish and superficial, the basic concepts are capable of holding interest.  It's a good thing then that film-making has grammar of its own and Abhishek Kapoor makes the narrative interesting enough to make two hours pass by in almost a blink. With so many themes that are so close to home for most of us, it is easy to hook us in - friendship of course, communal riots and cricket! Only thing missing here is Bollywood. With these themes as broad strokes, the director manages to get quite a bit of detail in his frames. The camera work is almost always jittery, not letting you settle in, in any one atmosphere, be it the romance between Govind (Raj Kumar Yadav) and Vidya (Amrita Puri) or Ishaan's (Sushant Singh Rajput) struggle with his adamant student Ali (Digvijay Deshmukh) or Omi's unsure personality being moulded into what his uncle (Manav Kaul) stands for. What keeps the film together, with its fluidity, though is the background score. It is lilting, melodious and subtle all at once.And of course, the performances are the glue too. Ace-rate performances by one and all make Kai Po Che worth the time, effort and money, by themselves. Each of their passions shone through be it business, cricket or politics. Their friendship worked too. Yet, I would now really like to see Raj Kumar Yadav in a role where he needs to speak slower, just so we know he can do it. Sushant Singh Rajput is refreshing and Amit Sadh has a screen presence without speaking much. I found, casting of Manav Kaul as the communal leader, the most surprising - younger and more polished than I'd have imagined the character. But, he fit in just right. Given the material they had, the tweaks the screenplay writers made, makes Kai Po Che really interesting. But, like with any film that is based on a book you've read, it is very difficult to shake the book off while watching it. There maybe debates (a few of which I heard on my way out of the theater) about what was added/deleted/edited from the book and whether or not that worked for the film. But as it stands by itself, the movie works because of the audience relates with the content. Only it felt like it was incomplete because it didn't delve deeper into each of the themes.Also, like with the book, the story starts out with friendship and its hardships and abruptly ends up becoming a larger national issue. But then again, isn't that pretty much what life is like? All dynamics change abruptly when a calamity hits you personally.Ultimately for me, the clincher was seeing a 600-seater full-house in a 'star'-struck nation for a film that doesn't sport any stars. Even the director isn't that big-ticket a name. Which means that people came either for the story they read or the trailers they saw. And I wasn't even surprised. This is a HUGE step.

525,623,623,623,623,Kaksparsh,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review25 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/kaksparsh-review/,,5/5.0,,4.7,"A lot of people may not find Kaksparsh the easiest film to watch, but Mahesh Manjrekar deserves a pat on his back just for the story that he has chosen to tell. A tale of love that transcends what is considered acceptable by society even today, this period piece is a credible film and a feather in Mahesh Manjrekar’s cap. ","""A film should be like a pebble in your shoe."" - Lars Von Trier Love stories come in all shapes and sizes. Some, like that of our very own Raj and Simran, make you root for the protagonists, they make you want the two to end up together. Then there are some, like my personal favourite, Casablanca, which make you feel like there is no love like one which is unrequited. And then, there is Mahesh Manjrekar's Kaksparsh, a complex love story unlike any other. Set across a time span of a few decades, the film starts off in pre-independence India, where Hari, a man of strict principles, is planning the wedding of his brother Mahadev, with the help of his close friend Balwant. Mahadev marries a teenaged girl, who hasn't even reached puberty yet. Tragedy strikes barely a few months later, as young Mahadev dies the very night they were to finally consummate their wedding. Then starts the journey of a complex, near-exasperating story - a love story. Kaksparsh can make some people uncomfortable, test the patience of some, perhaps even make a select few walk out. It poses questions for most of the narrative and resolves them at the end, only to pose new, larger and more difficult questions as it fades out. The most important of them - what, really, is love? Mahesh Manjrekar deserves appreciation, first for choosing this story to tell and then for the manner in which he has told it. The look, feel and mood that the film creates is first rate, even if the production design had a lot of scope to enhance the feel. One of Kaksparsh’s triumphs is the cast of the film. Sachin Khedekar anchors the film with a solid performance. Playing a stubborn man with strong opinions and principles is far harder than it sounds. For such a character to achieve any level of credibility is a task, and he more than delivers. Ketki Mategaonkar and Priya Bapat who play the young widow Uma in different stages of her life are extremely likeable and believable. Sanjay Khapre as Balwant is extremely competent as well. His face radiates the sense of stability that his character is meant to emanate.Kaksparsh holds your attention because of little details and moments. The customs and rituals of a Brahmin family in pre-independence India, little things like the language the older brother uses in a letter to his younger brother, even the historical connection that has been made with the character of Balwant, all these moments lend a texture to the film. Even more intriguing are the scenes involving the life of a young widow in the backward Indian milieu - especially a widow who has been bereaved even before the marriage is consummated. Love isn’t just about a man and woman having romantic feelings for each other. It is about how much you are willing to give up and how far you are willing to go for the person you claim to love. Kaksparsh deserves to be watched because the makers of the film dared to do something that few people do – tell a story that needed to be told, even if a majority of the audience will not identify with the characters and their motivations. It re-establishes Mahesh Manjrekar as a director with promise. Most importantly, it opens another trove of questions regarding what makes mankind unique as a race – the concept of love.

Fardeen Khan meets Uday Chopra to make Jacky Bhagnani, the 'dude'. Need I say more? And Riteish Deshmukh is a comic relief!?! The strike seems to have hit some story writers in their head!","Being a student of science is supposedly something extraordinary in the world of Bhagnanis. That is why they spend a significant part of the first hour in telling us how their lead hero is unique because Physics interests him. But actually what makes him irreplacable is that he knows how to sweep a woman of her feet, fight 5 ""machos"", have muscles that are worth showing off, move his feet to put the Hrithik Roshans of the day to shame...if you think I'm exaggerating, blame the writers of the film!If, so far, you haven't been reminded of the superhero of the 90s, take this. This story supposedly has comedy, drama, suspense, melodrama, romance, revenge, more drama, and I'm sure I'm missing a genre or two. And yet not one bit is entertaining. Each element looked like a part of a scene was first visualized and then the scenario was built around it with no connections to the scenarios before or after. Be it the fight sequences or the romantic ones. So, we have Jacky Bhagnani - an Uday Chopra look-alike who cringes his nose and expresses sadness with a blank face like Fardeen Khan. Giving credit where it's due, he can't do it as annoyingly as Fardeen. Then there's Vaishali Desai who is annoying because she's arrogant - for what, I haven't a clue. The worst-worst hit is seeing Riteish Deshmukh play comic relief and he doesn't get more than a laugh. That hurts, it really does. That Archana Puran Singh is a little less irritating than usual is hardly any consolation. Neither the hero nor the villain and none in between have interesting characters. The hero is of course the hero - ever-so-nice 24x7 with one and all, including people who insult him for no rhyme or reason. The villain doesn't inspire us to even raise a finger at him, let alone hate him. His motivations are unknown and we aren't motivated to find out either. Like most films of this nature, the songs come and go like guests as if the film was a cheap motel. No rhythm, nor need. The lyrics a tad better than one would expect in a set-up like this. The theater usher asked a girl who had just watched the film, ""how did you like the film?"" 
Her answer says it all. ""Sad..."" And you thought there was no tragedy in the film.

Such a shame to see likes of Paresh Rawal, Om Puri and Nana Patekar in such lame roles.","As expected, Kamaal Dhamaal Malamaal is everything we thought it would be – loud, ridiculously incoherent and annoyingly induces sleep. Yep, I strongly resisted my urge to nod off while waiting for the interval. I guess it was too loud to let me doze off.
It is such a shame to watch Paresh Rawal repeat himself endlessly and try to put his heart into it. It is so frustrating to watch Om Puri be at his loudest best. It is so disappointing to see Nana Patekar come back after such a long time and have nothing to do with his character except play emotionless, which of course he does well. And it is extremely upsetting to see Shreyas Talpade reduced to shouting in the name of acting. I am not even going to venture into talking about the plot and how it doesn't make sense, about the character transformations, etc. Any effort I put in seems like it would be more than what the writers could be bothered with. The minutest interest is triggered with how good-for-nothing and shameless Johnny (Shreyas Talpade) is. But that too wears off. How long can you hold on to yelling after all? What I am left with after the film is this ordeal of course of having to review it. But also with this thought. It's easy to pass a verdict and say that such films shouldn't be made. But, what if this is the only thing that keeps these actors in the game? And the trade-off is that it also keeps these directors/writers in too. Tough call.

What story, you may ask? And a good question it would be. I can't find a single nice thing to say about a film. Not a line, not one joke. What can you do when the maker's aim is to make an awful film? It runs literally dead slow and has not as much as an iota to savor.","An auspicious red and golden cloth flies across the bright blue Los Angeles sky. It is intercut between shots of the source and the destination - Sim's (Kareena Kapoor's) purse on to Viraj's (Akshay Kumar's) face. Creativity of the 50s-90s reproduces itself in Kambakkht Ishq. What were they thinking? Sorry, ""thinking"" is way too big a word. Usually, even if it's a bad film, I end up saying, ""at least it put some money in the flow, good for the economy."" But, I cannot stop hurting at the crores and crores of Rupees drowning from the drain to the core of the earth. What is it that prompted the supposed top-of-the-line stars of the country to entertain this no-line (ouch...just can't make myself call it a plot) and expect the film-starved country to be entertained? Unless the definition of entertainment has changed to - slo-mo entries, cake fight at a wedding, slap-a-thing-slap-it-again, leching, disgusting innuendos, and so on and so forth. The loud-louder-loudest, loud-louder-loudest contest between Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor, Aftab Shivdasani, Amrita Arora, Jaaved Jaffrey, Kirron Kher and basically the entire cast is insufferable. Kirron Kher and Jaaved Jaffrey should now retire from this genre. For that matter Akshay and Kareena will do themselves AND US good too by not allowing such projects to find its way on the screen. Kareena looks good but she almost always does. So, what's the value-addition made by this particular set of makers? Having the stalwarts of Hindi films cameo for your film is passé. Hollywood is the new trend. So, we have what looks like stock-footage of Bruce Willis to Angelina Jolie attending a ""Stuntman's award ceremony"". Then we have Denise Richards, Sylvester Stallone and Brandon do small gigs. And just in case you miss them, or don't recognize them, their name is repeated at every appearance. So, much for creative dialogue. The creativity actually lie in giving credits - Pooja Batra was credited for ""acquiring foreign stars"". Wonder who ""acquired the Bollywood ones""?The lines were bad, the jokes were lousy and needless to say predictable. The overall film cannot be called obvious because before you say the word ""film"" you know how it's going to end. Little did I know that the ""establishing characters"" bit was going to go on for the next 2.5 hours! I was wondering if the constant comments between Akshay and Kareena about each other's IQ was actually a hint at the audience who was still watching the film after the first 10 minutes. More often than not, movies of this scale have good songs and choreography with an aesthetic sense. Not here. Music is typical Anu Malik stuff. The lyrics although are a bit more interesting than usual. I don't remember ever having remembered my mom so often while watching a film. The brain went into a rhythmic pattern of internally yelling ""MUMMMMY!!!"" every couple minutes. The monsoon has set in guys. Go watch the leaves caress each other in the cool air. Certainly beats the awkward Akshay-Kareena lip-locks lip-pecks.

The focus on details of the shallow characters is sorely missing. Punch is forced into dialogue delivery to mask the lame lines. However, Shahid-Priyanka do well. ","The grainy texture, the stylish camerawork and finesse in the editing departments, do make it a different and enriching experience. Especially, if all you see is glitter and glamour of the Hindi film world. HOWEVER, this can't make-up for the lack of detail in the story and dialogue writing areas. And that's a huge let-down. Conclusion: I felt cheated by Kaminey.Yes, most certainly there are a few plot points which make the audience think and work its way through the cause and effect. And that's brilliant because I love being treated as an intelligent audience. There was also an underlying, witty political commentary which was both funny and insightful. But to counter them there are other plot points that have unexplained skips and jumps that can of course be explained by what I call Bolly-matic liberty. This also means that there is no 'twist' in the tale, everything goes as expected - as it has been happening over the last few decades. That's not acceptable in an action thriller. I wasn't able to give a discount to the fact that it has been done purposefully and offers appropriate tributes to Apna Desh and The Great Gambler. Moreover, though the climax ties the ends alright, it does so forcefully. To use a friend's words, ""the writer gave birth to a character, so he had to kill it."" Similarly, there are loads of characters that seem to exist just to increase the width of the plot, and add nothing to the depth. I liked the fact that they are all relatively small-timers in the crime-world. None of them was over-powering and each one was answerable to someone more powerful. The connections between them all worked too. But, each one had just one quirk to differentiate himself – some worked and some didn't. But they were all the same shade of black. Okay, except for the three main characters. I understand that one point the film was trying to make is that people in or related to the goon industry are all the same. Yet, finer details were missing. There wasn't anything that made you appreciate the writers' creativity. Surely, this is one of Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra's best performances. Both of them are looking and performing better by the day. I have to confess, though I found Shahid extremely attractive, taking my eyes off Priyanka was an effort whenever she was on screen. She is charming and vulnerable, strong yet completely dependent on her lover's affection and support. The other cast were a bunch of caricatures that didn't make me care for them. Despite all the negatives, the movie is a wholesome visual pleasure. We see a lot of handheld camerawork in non-Indian films and they usually tend to make me dizzy. I find myself complaining that the camera becomes the action choreographer in action thrillers abroad. Similar camerawork is used but I felt that the interval between cuts are just that beat longer to give me an orientation of who's hitting who, where and how. The establishing shots also add to the ambience.  A lot of my complaints could be because I don't want this in a Vishal Bharadwaj product. While walking out of the theater I wondered whether I'd be more accepting of any other lesser director. But, I remembered the first 30-45 minutes of the film, I was trying hard to like the film. It just wasn't working. It's been a while since I've seen a high-profile, much-looked-forward-to, Hindi movie 3 days after its release. Much after most of the reviews are out. Though I read none of them, that the general reaction was highly positive was difficult to miss. Not to mention, the original anticipation associated with the film. I'm guilty of not being able to go in with a clean slate. But, despite giving the film benefit of doubt for my high expectations, the film lacked the steam needed for an action-packed thriller. Most glaring is the writing department, especially the dialogue and then character development. Those are the culprits which kept Kaminey from being a wholesome experience.

Who would have thought that could be said about a 100% family drama?,"A close-up of an old couple holding hands – there are few moments that are as heartwarming as that. Kapoor & Sons is full of these. This in the midst of a good old family drama. Yeah, who would have thought a through and through drama plot-line could be likable. That too with its share of sexual innuendos and toilet humor. Kapoor & Sons is as good as any example of - if the “how” the story is told is done right, the “what” becomes secondary.Drama without dramatics – it has been so long since we have seen this that by itself it is refreshing. The first half of the film barely has any background music. And when things starts heating up in the second half, there is only a slight hint. That itself cuts the drama off to a great extent – keeping background music in its place. The “how” then is peppered with situations and a mix of snappy, funny, profound dialogue that fit the characters, the story, the milieu. In the end then, when you find yourself engrossed with the Kapoor family's problems – and not only because you identify with them – you are taken by surprise with how sentimental the film has managed to make you.Yes, you will see in the Kapoor family either your family or a family that you have been closely associated with. You will know why they feel better knit than a family that pushes things under the carpet. How their relationships are shattered by disclosures and how they, like any family, come together in difficult times – despite their differences, despite their personal anger towards the other. You relate to Kapoor & Sons also also because of its flawed characters and their portrayal by each one of the actors. The atypical dadu by Rishi Kapoor is more charming than both Rahul (Fawad Khan) and Arjun (Siddharth Malhotra). The two young actors themselves though play their own way of hiding or showing their inadequacies. You don't doubt it when other characters call Fawad Khan perfect or simple. Siddharth Malhotra slips up in a scene where he is angry but more than covers up for that in other instances, especially the one scene where he is dumbfounded. It is stunning how Alia Bhatt makes - being cool, sensitive, being both at the giving and receiving end of sympathy – look so easy. Rajat Kapoor and Ratna Pathak Shah play the disagreeable, frustrated couple/parents for you to think of real people they remind you of. And that is something Kapoor & Sons gets so right. When things get too real and serious, they edit smoothly into something that is bound to make you smile, if not laugh. This won't happen in real life, but hey – would they be stories if they reflected real life? The right balance between filmy and real is what makes Kapoor & Sons adorable despite its segue into borderline crass humor or even borderline melodrama. Of course, it is a tear jerker, like any family drama worth its salt ought to be. It is not about who gets the girl, or which sibling wins parent approval. It is also not about whether dadu lives or dies before he gets the family photograph clicked. “It's all about loving your family.”

","Marathi cinema has a long-standing, populist identity of being realistic. Very often, films nowadays are true stories, especially rural and social ones. Sure, there is no formula but filmmakers seem to be getting away with a lot. One, makers feel no liability to develop such stories. Two, almost everything goes under the mask of good intentions and realism. Third, these subjects help them garner enough sympathy to win big awards. This does what it needs to.As irrelevant as this maybe, Kapus Kondyachi Goshta claims to have won some 12 international awards. But that’s not the point. Its claim to have entered Oscar’s final list of contention is alarming, and that too for the ‘Best Picture' category. If indeed that’s true, how could it even manage to get there, when India’s best bet ‘Court’ couldn’t? A tough question, but not as significant as the actual worth of the product.Farmers’ suicide is an undying issue across the state. A lot has been filmed on their lives, more particularly in Marathi. But not sure how many of those focussed on families of the dead farmers. Death ends a problem for an individual, but what about the households that are left behind to endure the suffering? Kapus Kondyachi Goshta is their story. It’s an account of triumph over tragedies. And in a way, the idea itself is interesting and worth contemplating at the very least. But having potential is one thing and fulfilling it is another. As things stand, this film virtually covers all I said or missed in the beginning.A family of four sisters is coming to terms with the unpleasant life after their parents’ death. The entire village has abandoned them (for some unknown reasons).

","Marathi cinema has a long-standing, populist identity of being realistic. Very often, films nowadays are true stories, especially rural and social ones. Sure, there is no formula but filmmakers seem to be getting away with a lot. One, makers feel no liability to develop such stories. Two, almost everything goes under the mask of good intentions and realism. Third, these subjects help them garner enough sympathy to win big awards. This does what it needs to.As irrelevant as this maybe, Kapus Kondyachi Goshta claims to have won some 12 international awards. But that’s not the point. Its claim to have entered Oscar’s final list of contention is alarming, and that too for the ‘Best Picture' category. If indeed that’s true, how could it even manage to get there, when India’s best bet ‘Court’ couldn’t? A tough question, but not as significant as the actual worth of the product.Farmers’ suicide is an undying issue across the state. A lot has been filmed on their lives, more particularly in Marathi. But not sure how many of those focussed on families of the dead farmers. Death ends a problem for an individual, but what about the households that are left behind to endure the suffering? Kapus Kondyachi Goshta is their story. It’s an account of triumph over tragedies. And in a way, the idea itself is interesting and worth contemplating at the very least. But having potential is one thing and fulfilling it is another. As things stand, this film virtually covers all I said or missed in the beginning.A family of four sisters is coming to terms with the unpleasant life after their parents’ death. The entire village has abandoned them (for some unknown reasons). With no one to protect, farm or support, except a straightforward lawyer, they are on their own amidst the hinterland of cotton growers. The oldest sister knows the outcome of letting an outsider to farm their land. She thinks she doesn’t know farming. More so, she is unsure of entering a supposedly man’s territory.

Interactions between people from various backgrounds, ethnicities and age groups are captured gently. Not remotely as abstract as the title sounds.","Imagine you are visiting a friend or relative and they happen to have invited a group of friends. You as an audience are then just sitting in a corner and observing these people interact and react with each other. You know bits and pieces of their lives and are exposed to their prejudices and vulnerabilities. Karma aur Holi is not too worried about the pace. It doesn't at all look rushed especially considering that it's covering some 10-odd characters in just 90 minutes. And while a movie that covers so many characters usually jumps from one's story to another this one had a certain flow. That it was all happening in one house might have contributed to that feel. Because it's just like the audience is walking from one room to another. Also after a long-long time the characters accents felt real. The casting was just perfect. The gorgeous Sushmita Sen is perfect as the charming hostess, Mira. She juggles between being diplomatic and firm like any home-maker would do. Randeep Hooda, Mira's husband is trying to run a business while sticking to his guns. And then there are the whole range of characters from various age groups and ethnicities. I particularly enjoyed Rati Agnihotri's performance as the jittery, intolerant, middle-aged mother of a teenager. The teenage son was pretty good at what he did too! And I almost wanted to counsel Suchitra Krishnamurty's character as the suppressed wife to break the shackles and run for her life. One character we wouldn't have missed would be the voiceover narrator! He was so redundant. As usual, such stories feel a desperate need to have a resolution for each character. And the desperation shows. Thankfully though the closure for most of the threads is not forced. Except for the Rati Agnihotri-Suresh Oberoi angle. The transformation there was absolutely unwarranted and left a very 'this happens only in films' feel. And yet despite all the things that were good about Karma aur Holi, there was a 'no big deal' attached to it. The holi and suburban New York background had nothing to do with it really. The characters were all very similar either us or someone we know. That gives it a real feel but it also doesn't make it anything spectacularly special.

Unfortunately, they forget that they are supposed to maintain the depth because of which the same pace now seems sluggish. However, the twist is indeed worth the time because it's not 100% predictable. If nothing else Farhan Akhtar's ace performance is something you will relish for quite a while. ","The good news is that the film doesn't suffer from the first half-second half syndrome. The bad news is that it follows a bell-curve. It starts out real bad, gets very interesting, peaks and ends not only in jiffy but rather sloppily. Fortunately, the film is sprinkled with dialogues that are witty and crisp. 
The set-up is ordered with an over-dose of everything - an extra aggressive landlord who asks for extra rent for an extra small place; an extra-ordinarily hostile work environment that immediately reminds you of Rocket singh; an exceptionally mild protagonist Karthik (Farhan Akhtar) who everyone throws around. O-kay, got the point. So low and down is Karthik's life that the only way it can go is up. By now despite all the exaggeration, you begin to care for him. You want him to slap all the people around him - real hard. And he does. 40 minutes of this 140 minuter are done with. This is when it gets interesting. Obviously, a thriller is a thriller if you can't tell why is the character going through this. But, I like the ones in which you can't tell despite it staring you in the face. Of course, anyone can guess 95% of what's happening, but the next 5% comes as a surprise. Unfortunately, though you should've gone through a ""aaaah, like that"" moment what you feel is ""blah!"" when the mystery unfolds. However, the romantic relationship between Karthik and Shonali (Deepika Padukone) is explored in quite some detail and is extremely engaging. It touches upon girls wanting nice and safe guys to misbehave. :) The contrast between the two characters is set-up nicely too. One avoids mobile phones because for him they were invented to plague his health. The other smokes. One enters the office along with the cleaners, the other around lunch-time. Despite this the romance is believable and done in a jiffy compared to the pace of the rest of the film.Farhan plays the simple man whose world revolves around his job and his love interest (no rhyming words for nokri aur chhokri in English) to perfection. In my mind, he's still a director, but you see this man act and want to see every project he's involved in. The best bit is when Karthik gets into the loop and falls into a self-fulfulling prophecy. What is confusing to the entire world is plain and clear to him. Deepika too does a good job of playing out the hesitation Shonali goes through before getting into a relationship And that bit is consistent in the writing too, but then there is nothing more left to explore in the character. Except, at times, she shifts gear as if she's talking to a child. Even the ""I love you""s!The film has an exaggerated tone of gray in the gloomy situations, which makes the use of ambience a bit too in the face. So is the use of the Rubik's cube. True it has been used as a motif and a metaphor for what's happening with Karthik. But these things are supposed to be left to interpretation not shoved down the audience's throat. Let's not even get to the hurried way in which the technical aspects of the subject are handled - in a rush hoping the audience won't notice.Like I said, I'd watch the film just for Farhan's performance. And don't forget the concept is more than half-interesting. It's just a bit too long and yet left unexplained.

Bad news - We saw this almost 25 years ago and can watch it again at home any time we like!
Then, pray tell us, why would we want to see Himessss-bhai instead of chintu-mama?It's going to be claimed that the target is not the multiplex cine-goer but the ""masses"". Tell me, which section enjoys Himesh fainting down like every other pregnant woman in Hindi movies? And which section is going to be mesmerized by Urmila's fairy-tale-like vampish gait?Character sketches in movies like these are just amazing. For instance, the woman is given such an important place in the story line...after all our man is completely and unquestioningly smitten by her...and yet her function is less than that of a prop. She just exists. It must be some sort-of an art to make the object of 'true love' a bystander whose primary function is to lick ice-creams and go on a soft toy fetish. Damn, she doesn't even bother to offer support when the man of her life has disclosed the inner turmoil he's going through!In the 80's we thoroughly enjoyed if not thrived on the cinematic liberties taken. But hasn't the audience matured at least a bit since then? Even if each and every character, in sickness and in health, for richer or poorer, in Karzzzz have the best anti-aging cosmetics at their disposal. You are helpfully given 'then and now' transitions of brand ambassador Urmila Matondkar as proof. None of the characters manage an extra wrinkle, or an extra inch. I want whatever they are having!Oh, by the way, if you were thinking the makers were ingenious enough to only take from one movie made previously, get set to be proven wrong. Kabira (Danny Denzongpa) is given only lines from old Hindi movies to fit the particular situation. They are relevant enough so, it doesn't become painful. Though every time someone said ""kudrat ka karishma"" (nature's freak miracle), I felt like saying, ""not really, it happened more than 25 years ago (if not earlier).""
And then you have the blatant references to Deewar, Shaan, Mr. India. Not to mention the mimicry artist of a villain, bad man, Gulshan Grover doing a Feroze Khan-cum-Shaakal look. Of course, borrowing neither stops at dialogues nor at old Hindi movies. The songs are all seen there, heard that. No-no, I'm not referring to ""ek haseena thi"" or the signature tune from the original. (Although, the man actually sounds good when other voice-producing organs overpower the mighty nose!) I'm referring to the first song (""ishq is duniya mein"") that sounds like Himesh's compositions from earlier movies. And the second, third, and so on numbers which sound like the first. So, we actually have borrowing from the latest movie!The camerawork, background score etc. do try to give the movie a slick look - what with the action choreographer going for the home run with Himesh flying through a mansion. And however smart you make the movie look when it's about reincarnation, then the half-hearted attempt at logic/logistics in the climax makes you laugh only harder.One argument could be that if Karz is likeable what's wrong with Karzzzz? It’s the same story after all. But somehow, the balance tilts against a Himesh Reshammiya being snickered at by most members of the audience every time he attempts emotion.

However, the preachiness is bound to put off some.","Before watching the film, the most interesting pull factor about Kashala Udyachi Baat for me was that this was Anupam Kher’s first ever Marathi film. Perhaps one of the most under-utilized actors of our times (partly due to his own doing), the fact that he was said to have dubbed for the film himself was an added bonus. However, Kashala Udyachi Baat, in spite of having an interesting concept at its core, is an unfulfilling effort, primarily because in an effort to get its message across, the film takes to sermonizing.Aditya Pradhan, played by Sachin Khedekar, is an ambitious, career-obsessed IT professional who has no time for those who should matter most in life. For him, they are a cursory duty that he needs to fulfill on his journey to professional success. Fed up with him when he misses an important event in his daughter’s life, his wife, played by Mrinal Kulkarni, packs her bags and leaves for home with her daughter. Groundhog Day then takes over for a while as Aditya Pradhan is stuck in a time loop – he wakes up every day to the same day, a Sunday – a means for him to savour the finer nuances of life. In comes a mysterious blind stranger, who acts like a beacon for him in his state of the eternal Sunday.Directed by Pramod Joshi, Kashala Udyachi Baat does have its moments, something that goes without saying. A time loop concept will always be interesting, because there is always a magnetic charm to the idea of non-linearity in life. However, when the time loop is over-done, the concept can begin to grate, much like the cacophony of his neighbours that Aditya Pradhan has to wake up to every Sunday. Adding insult to the injury caused by the draggy screenplay is an item number that really finds no place in this film.Sachin Khedekar is a talented actor, of that there is no doubt. In fact, one can often see why he was chosen to play this part. He is a natural when it comes to showing the exasperation that an ordinary man can feel with his life. However, he is one of those actors who continuously needs to be reined in, because over-the-top comes as naturally to him as subtle does. Mrinal Kulkarni is another actor who I am extremely fond of simply because of the presence that she exudes. Though she doesn’t get much to do in this film, her appearance is always a joy. Anupam Kher does a fairly decent job, even with his Marathi, although it did seem a little stilted. I also often got the feeling that it wasn’t his voice at all, although that could be just my imagination. What is good to see is that actors like him and Naseeruddin Shah (in Deool) are featuring in Marathi films. Hopefully, this will provide the much-needed fillip to an industry that deserves it.Apart from the said item number, Kashala Udyachi Baat feels like an honest effort. What happens invariably though, is that the film veers towards being preachy and moralizing. Yes, there is more to life than work and success. But hammering it on the audience’s head might not entirely get the message across. The film looks and feels right, but mediocre writing will always sink a film, no matter what. The film is a half-decent effort, but a sharper, more insightful screenplay would have made it truly worth a watch. As it stands though, the film is really just something you could switch to on TV if the other options are re-telecasts of Golmaal or Ghajini.

Insightful, scathing and even a tad bit depressing at times, the film is crisp and thoroughly entertaining, but with also a rather pertinent point to it all.","Metro city dwellers who rarely, if ever, face severe power crises, probably take their access to electricity for granted. But for a large portion of India outside the biggest cities, daily prolonged power cuts because of deficits in generation and supply, are still a sad reality.Katiyabaaz, a documentary on the pitiful state of affairs with regard to electricity in Kanpur, is quite an eye opener. Not only does it succinctly and memorably highlight the key aspects of the subject it deals with, but it also is pretty much a reminder of what is wrong with India today.Narrated by following two diverse points of view - one of a katiyabaaz (a term for someone who provides illegal electricity connections), and the other of a bureaucrat who headed Kanpur Electricity Supply Company Ltd or KESCO - the film takes us through the gamut of problems that the citizens face, and the lengths they go to in an attempt to fix it.The former, Loha Singh, is who one you could consider the target audience of Salman bhai's Eid releases. He is flashy, funny, garrulous, belligerent and has a rather disproportionate sense of self worth. And yes, he manages to come up with some outrageous one-liners. But what one would notice most about him if one observes him carefully, is his willingness to tread moral lines. You see, here is a man who knows he's doing something illegal, but who feels he has the right to do so, because he has been screwed over by the system, the villain.Symbolising this villain is Ritu Maheshwari, who assumes KESCO's reigns at one of its worst periods. She is honest, intelligent and seems to genuinely want to change the system. One really feels for her, as she tries her best to set things straight, crack down on power theft so that electricity can be distributed better, and attempt to connect to consumers better through the use of technology. Yet, there is only so much a bureaucrat can do when the populace is stubborn and the political leadership is ineffective in providing better infrastructure.The film rather beautifully captures the flavour of Kanpur, which is as enchanting as any other place in Uttar Pradesh, never mind the sorry plight of law and order in the state. It is gut-wrenching to think of a city that was once known as the Manchester of the East because of its former glory days as a centre of industry, reduced to shambles as a place that suffers daily power cuts of as long as 15 hours. (Oh, and its former name, Cawnpore, has such an old world charm to it!)The film treads shaky ground, however, when you consider how it has been treated. Situations that would have been a surreptitious part of daily life in Kanpur take place in front of the camera, and hence they end up looking staged. Loha Singh in particular, while a hoot in his interviews, seems to be playing to the gallery when not talking directly to the camera. He seems conscious of the fact that he has a shot at doing what his cinema idol does - perform for an audience - and he seems to relish the idea. These portions of the film - the ones that appear fake (for want of a better word) - are where the film's intentions come into question, even though it carefully avoids taking any actual sides.Still, the film unfolds with the pace and style of a thriller, before it ends on a high that raises questions that one would really like to delve deeper into. If this is what it takes to popularize the documentary format in India, then so be it. But Katiyabaaz is a film that every Indian will identify with and learn from, if they truly want to.

A little comedy - slapstick even, the typical woo-ing and faking nonchalance, and a lot of lingering around with nothing happening. For some reason it felt like the run-time was decided before the script - the movie has to be this long no matter how you reach the number. Add songs, add random back and forth, add inconsequential scenes. No matter if they don't hold an iota of viewer's interest. It is understandable that there can be no logic when love is at first sight. But, doesn't a romantic film let you in on why the relationship has held together so long? You can tell why Madhav Kabra (Imran Khan) has fallen in love with the chirpy Paayal Malhotra (Kangna Ranaut) but you don't know her side of the story at all. Why is she with him?Anyway, we have to be convinced because he is convinced. So we accept and move on. But move on, he just doesn't. Yes, at least one end of a couple finds it very difficult to let go after most breakups.  Our man Madhav aka Maddy seems to be the one in this love story. And that is pretty much the story. That he doesn't give up. That his gut tells him what his eyes see and brain processes don't ring true. But, you get that in the first 10-15 minutes of the film while the film spends the next hour and more making sure you got the intensity right. Except that, it doesn't work on the intensity. It just asks you to believe the sulking Imran Khan. You don't feel the pain, other than the one when you realise it is not even interval yet. Other than the back and forth time-line that the film uses to go between Madhav-Paayal's present break-up era and the years gone by when their love blossomed, Katti Batti has very little to keep you interested. And that too gets boring after a bit. In fact, the criss-crossing time-lines seem to have confused the writer themselves and the “physical intimacy” chronology is a little difficult to believe. In the middle of a making out scene, Madhav claims he just wants to cuddle in response to Paayal's “You want to make love, don't you?” Just doesn't fit in. So, the makers try to make it up with different kind of picturisation for a few of the songs. It is intriguing, entertaining even. But, it gives the film a surreal video album kind of a glaze. Making the story even more unbelievable than it already is. 
That leaves all the onus of making something worthwhile in the film to the lead cast. Since what we can call the story is from Madhav's point of view, Kangna Ranaut hardly has worthy screen time. And the by the time she does have some meat to play around with, it is too late. Madhav on the other hand, has two modes in his point of view – sulk and smitten. He does play both reasonably well, but then again nothing we haven't seen before. It also feels like the romantic lead label for Imran Khan comes more from his chocolate-boy looks than actual romance. No romance, zilch comedy in this rom-com. Should they stop trying so hard to remake movies and try their hand at some novel story-telling if not original stories?~ ~ ~ps. A quick word about the use of FOSLA – Frustrated One Sided Lovers' Association. Way back in 1995-96, I am pretty sure, one from our group of friends had come up with this idea/concept. It was surprising to hear of the book, a rumor about a film and then see it in Katti Batti today. I guess, things had their own way of going viral back then. :D

You are more likely to find yourself laughing at the one-dimensional drivel harvested from newspaper articles rather than let real research work move you profoundly. Add a bland and unaffecting love story to the mix and you have a guaranteed recipe for disaster. Even Om Puri can’t salvage this one.","I couldn't review Khap because it didn’t release in Pune. And looks like I didn't miss much. Thank you, Danish, for covering this one for wogma! - meetuHonestly? Is it really that difficult to make a compelling, intelligent movie based on or inspired from real life incidents? ‘Khap’ should easily make a worthy case study as to how our filmmakers set off on “good intentions” only to turn a serious and deep issue into giggle worthy melodramatic drivel. So keeping in line with the USP of the site, I won’t give any details about the plot other than a brief outline. An estranged son, Madhur (Mohnish Behl) who works for the National Human Rights Commission, returns to his village after sixteen years to investigate honour killings supposedly carried out at the behest of the Khap Panchayat. Madhur’s father Omkar Chaudhary (Om Puri) is one of the heads of the Panchayat and father and son don’t exactly see eye-to-eye on many issues with the son taking a firm stand against the practice of honour killings. So after much posturing and speeches back & forth about the “pros & cons” of Khap Panchayats and honour killings, cinematic co-incidence rears it’s ugly head in the form of Madhur’s daughter, Ria who elopes with a boy of the same gotra. Boy oh boy! Get those pitchforks and torches ready.Last year Priyadarshan tried to tackle a similar topic with Mississippi Burning Aakrosh which again made a mockery of things by inserting such “credible” sequences in which Ajay Devgn slides under a moving train and stands atop a moving car dodging branches; but keeping the inherent silliness aside both Aakrosh & Khap suffer from a serious lack of research & good writing. Both seem content in painting a sensationalist picture of some serious issues which has more depth than the screenplay of any of these movies accords it; characters & situations aren’t credibly fleshed out but pointless love-songs run amok. I guess this kind of treatment does make you wonder what “good intentions” were the makers referring to. I have no love for the Khaps or their ways but can’t help but find their portrayals utterly one-dimensional; sneering, glaring, moustachio-ed, hookah smoking men talk about prathas & hamara kanoon. The movie tries to overcome this problem by presenting Om Puri with a moral dilemma thus setting him up for an inevitable cultural transformation. However it’s the lecturing back and forth between all characters that gets tiresome and preachy thus never allowing any of them to grow beyond paper-thin clichés; moral one, amoral one, misguided one, turned a new leaf one, blood-thirsty one…you see? The romantic track lays waste to what little chance of redemption laid with the other dramatic elements of the movie. It’s so bad & unconvincing that it almost makes you root for the Khap Panchayat to administer whatever punishment they deem fit and end our suffering right away. The camerawork, background score & art direction will remind you of television grade material the onus of which lies solely with director Ajai Sinha, who was the man behind TV soaps such as Hasratein and Astitva- Ek Prem Katha. So, he brings the same small-screen sensibilities to this project, effectively making a two-hour pilot for a future TV series instead of a feature film. Khap fails on every front, it’s ineffective as a social commentary, it’s overlong and preachy (not to mention unintentionally funny), it’s saddled with a love story which you hope ends as soon as it begins, though I would highly recommend Alok Nath’s little monologue about the dangers of inter-gotra marriages, it was the piece de resistance of the film and might be the funniest bit of cinema you might watch all year long.  What was supposed to send a shiver down your spine is more likely to tickle your funny bone or simply put you to sleep; avoid it at all costs.

The comedy is tasteless, and has no direction and the story serves no purpose. ","One would expect the Priyadarshan and Akshay kumar combination to be able to come up with something potentially entertaining. For my sake, while standing in the line for tickets I was praying Khatta Meetha would be the funniest movie of the year. It wasn’t. I’ll tell you what surprised me, though. Not the fact that people were rolling over and laughing on stale jokes, not even that the first day, first show was almost housefull. It was mostly because the audience cheered loudly, whistles et al, at intervals of 5 minutes for everything Akshay Kumar said. All there is to Khatta Meetha are a bunch of hyperactive characters, trying to pull off a “political satire” with slapstick comedy and no storyline. It is a remake of Priyadarshan’s original Malayalam film Vellanakalude Nadu, which was highly successful in 1989. Adapted to a Marathi setting the movie is about a notorious road contractor Sachin Tichkule (Akshay Kumar) and his journey through corruption and red-tapism. He struggles with his job, regularly cons people off their money, but it’s Akshay Kumar. He is the ever so earnest protagonist who is only notorious because he needs to make the audience laugh. His comic timing is just about decent but the jokes are too stale. Priyan’s stock characters, Rajpal Yadav and Asrani, are no better. Even his antagonists, Akshay’s brothers and brothers-in-law, have negligible screen presence, and all their interactions take melodramatic, loud acting to a new level. Trisha Krishnan seems like a dummy in the hands of the script, or lack thereof. It seems like she was placed in the shoot and asked to recite her lines, because she constantly shifts between being the girl next door-wannabe abhla nari, and a curt municipal official. She carries off neither roles, nor certainly a role that commands for her to be taken seriously.The most frustrating part of the movie is how earnestly it tries to comment on contemporary corruption issues. Priyadarshan tries to pull it off by shifting in a jarring manner between loud comedy and even louder intense scenes. None of which seem to fit in the larger context of the film. Sure, the movie brings out the truth about road construction and dirty politics, but what’s new about it? Rajneeti would have been a quieter option.Maybe we can give him some credit for trying, but I’m guessing that got washed away the minute we heard about the comparison between Sachin Tichkule and R.K.Laxman. For God’s sake, they are not the voice of common men in the same way. Sachin Tichkule is Akshay Kumar with a good comic timing but no sense of a good script, loud dialogues, a few provocative songs and a blind audience following. The movie attempts to say a lot in the 2 and half hours it runs, but with repeated action. It’s a cycle of noisy dialogues, slapstick jokes, cut to serious scenes with forced intensity and back to comic relief. The chemistry between Akshay Kumar and Trisha Krishnan is cold, with their constant bickering and his sexist attitude towards her. It seems like a bigger farce when they get together at the end of the movie, out of the blue, without any real explanation.  The only thing that seems mentionable here is that Akshay Kumar carries off the common man attire in an apt way. When you see him in a dull shirt, a cheap pen in the pocket and chappals, you believe he looks the part. When he screams in frustration that he cannot to afford to pay any more money, amidst his bureaucratic mess, you understand. But that alone is not enough to pull the movie through. It seems dated because it might have been blindly adapted from 1989 to 2010. The setting seems old; the women characters behave like they live in the 40s and the social issues have been overdone. Remember Hera Pheri? Surely Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar are capable of much better.

Even if it's only towards the end. By climax time if you don't want bad things to happen to the characters, however small their roles were, something has gone right somewhere. Only, I wish it got me involved right from the beginning. On the other hand, the closing credits themselves made the film for me, doubt they would have worked if I had not seen the story that was told before them. So yeah, mixed feelings because of the execution, and because it's a perfect history lesson. A must-know story with dull narration.","A chapter in history that begins with the geography of the country. The classroom effect is hard to shake off and is made only more difficult with Abhishek Bachchan digressing from a Math lesson straight into a mini-lecture on revolution. After this lame sequence, I didn't know whether I'd laugh or cry for the next 2.5 hours; all while the cast/crew wanted to inspire. The audience around me was laughing. And that grew louder with Deepika Padukone's entry. The lady just breaks into a song! BUT, things settle down. It's not that the unintentional laughter dies, but slowly, very slowly you are hooked. And it goes into 5th gear post-interval. The execution of the plan is engaging, despite the complete lack of depth in characters.There are some 60 odd revolutionaries, about 7-8 main ones. But none of them have any distinguishing character. They are all willing to give their lives for the cause, they all care for each other with heart and soul, they all want to make whatever little contribution they can. Maybe in that time and age the mob identity was their personal identity. And yet, the reactions by different people to the same situation is both eye-opening and touching. You will have to wait for the second half to see this though. Director, Ashutosh Gowariker's plan to keep the set-up of the grand plan in the first half, and focus on execution and aftermath in the second half is a huge dampener to the pace. The portrayal of the aftermath is the most interesting and well-executed part of the film and the end credit roll is as good as it could get. Another decision that either the director or the writer made is to assume that the viewer knows the history and the backdrop of the Chittagong conspiracy. This decision is what kept me from getting involved. Also, the narrative is like a father is telling a story to his son, ""this happened, then that happened, then this happened"". A flow is missing. A little background, a little rhythm to get the viewer into the atmosphere that the characters were living in would have made me care for the characters much sooner. And despite that, I was on board by the end. And that I think is what a good basic plot can do. As you realize by the end, there is no great dialogue, no room for brilliant performances, and yet you are with the characters. The pathos created in the last third of the film has gone a long way in doing that. So many characters and each is given its own room in the true story and thus in the film. So much so that, in this star-driven world of Hindi cinema, you don’t see either Abhishek Bachchan or Deepika PAdukone get in the way of their characters (until the end, where I guess they had to justify Abhishek's fee). And they all do just fine.  They were crazy. Anyone who leaves the comfort of their home and fights for a cause that is not necessarily theirs has to be crazy. They fought for our freedom. Who is to say that the struggle, which lasted a few centuries, wouldn’t have gone on for 80 more years? Who's to say we wouldn't have to stay out of the McDonalds and the multiplexes along with their dogs? We don't know why they were so passionate about our freedom, but they were. The least we can do is be aware of their story. So what if it's not told in the most engrossing manner. Not screwing up our freedom that they were eccentric about is too much to ask for, right?

But that is only if you HAVE to watch it in the first place. And I don't see why anyone would want to do that. ,"When a film is so over-the-top and the situations are so exaggerated, I tend to look for the spoof in it; the underlying comment; the cynicism. And of course, left to imagination, it ain't too difficult to find it either. But, Khichdi is so crass, that even when I laughed, I felt yucky inside. It's not the toilet-humor kind of crass. It's absolutely (hopefully-miles-away-from-reality) insensitive crass. I guess, it's their way of saying nothing is worth taking seriously - neither deaths and funerals nor weddings; and certainly not respect for the older generation let alone each human. And while they are at it, as is in vogue these days, a potshot at the media and the education system too. As if darker the joke, harder were the writers laughing at how seriously we treat the issue in real life. 
And thus, you can find social and philosophical commentary on almost everything - from asking the creator of the universe about the scarcity of water, to a human's love for creating problems for himself - a lot of ground is covered. And most of it using juvenile humor better known as PJs (poor jokes or more appropriately lame pun jokes). My affinity for such humor is obvious. In real-life and as an audience, they are all equally greeted with eye-roll after eye-roll. Yet I appreciated the fluidity of the situations. A film like this could very easily have been episodic. Even the most expensive 'comedy' films from India are episodic. But, Khichdi at least has some semblance of cause giving rise to an effect, rather than a backward calculation. Also, given the genre, I guess the lot of actors did a fine job of looking into the camera while acting! My palm was stuck to my forehead all through a scene in which the characters are giving each other acting lessons.Aaaye-aaye-aaye-aay-aay. What will become of this universe? Someone please tell me, Khichdi's huge following on TV is a analogical poor joke.

At times, that's a good thing, getting what you came for. At other times, like this one, it is loud and insufferable.","If I get bored out of my mind watching such films again and again, don't the makers get bored of making them again and again. Maybe, it's because each team/person doesn't make as many as I watch. Fortunately. Khiladi 786 is yet another one of those painfully non-sensical, supposedly comic ones that you'd hesitate calling a film.Khiladi 786 actually makes it too easy for a viewer to rip it apart. Every department is so awful at its job that you could begin anywhere to criticize it and that would be the right place to start. From action to editing to music to acting to dialogue to choreography - all you want to do is tear-your-hair-apart, but since you can't do that you just end up cringing. So much so that I am confident I could say the same thing about the story had there been an effort to write and tell one.Do not be fooled by the initial set-up where you have a fake, macho police officer who plays Robin Hood and wants a woman to woo (Akshay Kumar); a mafia-leader called Tendulkar (Mithun Chakraborty) who has a sister (Asin) he wants to wed off; and a want-to-be match-maker (Himesh Reshammiya). A couple of lies later, you know the writers thought that's all that's needed to make a full length feature film.Can you really blame a music director/singer turned actor turned writer to not know how to develop an idea into an enjoyable story? Not that that idea was great to start with, but we barely can tolerate him as a music director. And I want to erase the memory of Himesh Reshammiya trying to mimic himself by going double nasal in a song he sang for Akshay Kumar. In addition, his attempt at comic timing and pulling faces to draw a laughter from the audience only reminds me of school plays. Also, shouldn't it be a criminal offense to create a tune that is not only annoying but gets stuck in your head? I'm talking about 'khiladi bhaiyya, khiladi bhaiyya, khilaaadhi' which is repeated often enough in the film to get on your nerves and shamelessly flaunts its existence after you are out!Anyway, it's a shame to see Mithun Chakravorty and Raj Babbar in such pithy, meaningless roles. Even if it has all kind of Gunda references for the former. And actually, it's a shame to see even Akshay Kumar put in his all for this one. Asin gets to play the same-old loud-mouth, brash woman. No creativity whatsoever there.A lot of the fun is supposed to be had from the 'action' in such action comedies. And usually, I complain about the camera doing the action instead of the actors or their stunt doubles. But, funnily enough, here 72 Singh aka Khiladi 786 aka Akshay Kumar is a Speedy Singh. Which means he moves so fast that you cannot see him. And guess what? Shoddy editing is used to make things go missing to 'show' this action. It is outright insulting, patronizing and frustrating - all at once. Which pretty much summarizes all of Khiladi 786 - insulting, patronizing and frustrating.

","Good romantic comedies are few and far between. Well, of course, I mean the ones that make you laugh and go ""awwww"" alternately. There are others that try and you wish they hadn't. Khoobsurat has honest moments that make you want to fall in love all over again and times when you laugh out loud. That is not to say it doesn't have clichés and all things that go with the word Disney, prince and princesses. In that sense, Khoobsurat (2014) differs from Khoobsurat (1980) in one significant way. The focus is much more on romance here than it is on binding the family, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The further a remake steers from the original, the better its chances of working. The biggest surprise is Sonam Kapoor. It's like she has left herself loose, like she has finally gotten comfortable in front of the camera. In many ways, she reminded me more of Kareena Kapoor in Jab We Met and Katrina Kaif in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara more than Rekha from the original Khoobsurat. Doesn't help that the characters are all similar, but more to do with how stiff these women were in the films before these and these films saw them let go. There are a few other charming details (other than the prince himself, more on him later). The supporting characters from King Rathod's aide, Ramsevak to King Rathod himself; from the prince's little sister Divya to her mom, Her highness, Nirmala Rathod (her first name a nod to the corresponding character in the original film). The characters have slight flourishes to them that keep you interested and are played out very well by the actors themselves. The only sore thumb being in the form of Kirron Kher. Isn't she done playing the loud Punjabi mom just yet? I understand the Punjabi background comes in handy when you want to show that the genes transferred is what produces the uber-chirpy Mili (Sonam Kapoor). But, it is just tiring to see that stereotype. What it helps though is to accentuate the stark contrast between Mili and Prince Vikram (Fawad Khan). Fawaad Khan has a lovely restraint about his persona. It is like this role was meant for him and him only. While he needs to hold just one expression through most of the film, when he does need to deviate, he does it with the slightest change and yet makes it believable. What also keeps things believable in this palatial setting are some very day-to-day one-liners. The kind you and I would quip nonchalantly and laugh hard over. Some of the situations created and the way they are resolved are rather normal too. And normal in a way that doesn't bore you. That part of real life that you don't mind seeing on reel. Not to mention, for a change the voiceovers that start out sounding awkward turn into amusing train of thoughts that every one has, when they are thinking one thing and saying another. Another thing which though I really loved, am not sure if it went with the tone for the film was Sneha Khanwalkar's music. It has such a lovely quirky ring to it that you are thankful for its existence irrespective of whether or not it was meant for the said film. I don't if I should be happy or sad that they had someone else do the end-credit song. Where Khoobsurat misses out then is when characters transition. Perfectly consistent characters that have grown on you, change suddenly. It all seems a bit too convenient. A little too predictable with no effort at masking the predictability. The movie wasn't going to end any other way, you know it and so do I. But some effort at staying away from typicality would've kept the tone of the film through till the end.  Yet, it's something I would recommend for a light Sunday afternoon. It is guilty pleasure. It is saccharine sweet and fluffy. It is candy floss - it won't satiate your appetite, but will feel good while you are at it and a little after.

And there is always the generation gap to deal with. That’s serious stuff. The name of the movie is hilarious. The posters and the one promotional song that I had seen made it look like a slapstick comedy. Hardly…it is not even borderline-comedy! Not surprising, considering the movie is produced by an advertising agency. They really cannot exist without misleading marketing! Overall, the movie is a quite dull. There is something right about the execution, though. It is admirable that Dibakar Banerjee kept the characters simple and carefully avoided the glitter and glamour, the song and dance. Some parts are handled pretty well. For example, the way a dream is used to show a facet of a character; the way different characters react to an announcement that a member of their family is going to the US; the way props are used to intimidate characters; the way IIT-Delhi T-shirts are used instead of GAP. But then, ordinary characters that you can identify with…get boring! It lacks the intensity, the crispness, needed to make a movie out of the subject.The plot does not help too much either, nothing exciting happens through the movie. If the story had a couple twists, it could have kept the interest alive. Thankfully, the songs that play in the background, help break the monotony. Watch out for some good performances though. Anupam Kher makes your heart go out for Mr. Khosla. I especially liked Navin Nischol’s role and the way he has played it. Parveen Dabbas, Tara Sharma, and Ranvir Shorey show how they are learning with experience. Boman Irani plays a creepy property dealer. Now, the way this character is presented is irritating. For one, it is the character inconsistency. In the first half he had this street-smart personality and in the second half the simplest person pulled wool over his eyes. Then there is the acting itself. Boman Irani does this thing with his left nostril and smirks, to make him look his character. It worked for the first minute of screen time, but that’s how his nostril and half-lip stayed through the movie. In his opening shot, he has this cool lighting on the lower half of his face and bottom-up camera angle that makes him look sinister. But then the same effect is used on other characters and it loses its significance. While we are on photography, the wide angle is over-used. Also, it is annoying when the expressions of a character change between the close-up shot and a zoom-out in the same shot but from a different angle. Maybe, it is all deliberate and had a purpose in the larger scheme of things. But if while watching the movie, I have time to think about what the cameraman is doing, then, either the cameraman is not doing his job right or the director.

It feels like the crew took a break after each sequence and the loss of continuity shows. While the songs reflect the charm of the 50s, you might be better off just listening to them.","The characters do things abruptly, the story leaps from one point to the next without giving the audience any clue. It reads like chapters of a book with each chapter ending in a cliffhanger. However, when you start the next chapter you realize that the cliffhanger was not such a big deal after all. I don’t want spoon-feeding, but some hint of the transitions that the characters and their relationships are making would give the narrative a much needed flow. Soha Ali Khan, Shiney Ahuja, Rajat Kapoor, and Vinay Pathak are all good actors. But, here they come across as just going through the motions. It can be claimed that the movie is not really a story but just a comment on the lifestyles of the people it is about. But, for that to come across too, a certain amount of insight into the character is necessary.Khoya Khoya Chandrevolves around Nikhat and her relationships. But by the time you have figured that out, you have lost interest. Mainly because the screenplay meanders around trying to show everyone's point of view. I usually enjoy movies/stories narrated from various points of view, but here not one view is fully fleshed out. Even Nikhat's character doesn't seem completely thought out.Isn't it a shame that after spending over two hours with Nikhat you have no clue what she feels for the other characters in the movie? Or is that how she is? Clueless about her own relationships? Either which way, you couldn’t care less. The chops from one scene to the other are also very distracting. Before you can sink your teeth into what a character is trying to say/do/feel you are led straight into the next episode. I very rarely question why a person falls in love with another person. You know - ""love happens"". But, after having blindly accepted that, I think I deserve a peep into how the couple spends time together and how they grow apart. Nope, no such luck. I am just told, by way of plain dialogue or glycerin-filled eyes what transpired after the last scene. Khoya Khoya Chand is also about emptiness in the lives of people, more specifically of people that work in the film industry. It also shows the fallibility of the ""stars"" as people who are portrayed larger than life in reel-life. The irony is staring you in your face. Uh...so what? We know that. Our ""star"" who played the oh-so-lovable Munnabhai is in and out of prison for being involved with terrorists for goodness sake! However, I'd like to thank the director for taking us to the charming 50s-60s. (Except for the title song - which is the best, but it seems a little modern compared to the setting of the rest of the movie.) Especially the songs - music, lyrics, presentation. The music and lyrics are truly refreshing.Yet, I saw no specific reason for it to be set in the 50s. It might as well have been a present-day story. True, there are tributes to various actors, directors, music directors of that era. And there certainly must have been a few that I missed because I am not completely aware of what was happening in the personal lives of people from that era. Any which way, I found the lives portrayed very one-dimensional, very ordinary.And the other technical aspects are extraordinarily bizarre. The light seemed to be coming in from the weirdest places and gave many scenes a very artificial look. There were way too many close-ups and almost no on-location sets. It made me feel like I was trapped in low-budget Bhansali-land. And when the camera wasn't closing in on faces, it was going around in circles for no particular reason. More so, towards the end of the movie. Put together, they didn't create any impact at all. And what exact purpose were the time-transition title cards serving - ""One month later"", ""two months later""? Were they supposed to imply that whatever was shown after the last title card happened in one day? However, the title cards in the end said loud and clear, ""this is where we ran out of money, so sorry - story finish. khel khatam, paisa hajam (money digested, game over). Tata. Good bye. Go home."" Haven't seen a more abrupt ending in the recent past.  As I write this review, I am running through the movie again and again. It's a Sudhir Mishra product. There must be some larger point, where is it hiding? Or maybe the point is to show the pointlessness of existence. If so, it doesn't interest me, and so this one was clearly not for me.Parental guidance: When there is a good chance that adults might get bored, I doubt children are going to sit through it. Besides, the story is about adult relationships. Visually there are a couple mild love scenes.

The way in which the author's take on Islam - the use and abuse of the religion - unfolded, or that someone even dared to touch upon it so openly in the first place, that too in Pakistan. I think there would be very few makers for this kind of a story even in India - a secular state. And by the climax, I was amazed at the number of issues Khuda Kay Liye touched upon. We had the whole gamut. Atrocities faced by women at the hands of fellow-Muslims, double standards of Muslim parents living abroad (I have seen this with non-Muslim Indians too), injustice disseminated because of racial profiling, Jihadi's misuse of easily-influenced-relatively-meek youngsters to turn them into terrorists. Each problem is given its own space to breathe and develop.The parallels drawn between the racial profiling storyline based out of Chicago and all the other things happening in Pakistan were amazing. There are points where you can interchange the US law officials with the Jihadi leaders in terms of their unyielding attitude towards whatever they believe is the truth. How they all mince words to have people say what they want to listen to. And to make sure the audience doesn't miss the parallels, the similarities are directly shown towards the climax.The strong and clever dialogues had a huge role to play in the overall impact In the name of Godhad. I was wondering how much more effect it would have had on me had I understood the language completely. The use of Urdu is elegant, and at the same time not entirely overwhelming. Since the movie is more or less situation-driven you can make a fair guess from the context. However, there was a lack of the same aptitude in the departments other than story and dialogue. In particular, the editing was very abrupt and didn't render a smooth flow. The only exception was in the climax scene in the courtroom, where the cuts worked towards narrating the story. Similarly, while the songs were beautiful, the shifts in and out of western classical in the background music seemed pretty random. Most of the actors too came across as very stiff. Only, Shan (Mansoor) stood out with an excellent performance - from the inspired musician to a completely broken down man. Fawad Khan who played a confused youngster, Sarmad, did look aptly baffled. So it would be too soon to judge whether he can really enact other emotions. But, given the strength of the message all these shortcomings seem pardonable. The questions that I am left with are - Has it reached the right ears? Or at the very least have the people sitting on the fence convinced to keep from committing such heinous acts?

This one is surely one of them. It makes you contemplate. But above all, the experiment grips you throughout.","A thing with some social issue-driven films, which I hate particularly, is that they think they can demand sympathy and get away with their flaws in the name of the said cause. However, at times wonders happen – wonders which engross you through and through, wonders which express angst, pain without being dramatic. Khwada does that or perhaps even more. Raw, minimalistic, unconventional and straightforward on the face of it, yet effortless, engaging, thought-provoking and witty, the film is both a rare and difficult combination. Rare because very few get it so well, and difficult because it has strong chances of being labelled as either experimental or unprofitable, or both. Whatever the future holds, it marks a fairly decent debut, even so with blemishes that accompany it.A family of shepherds forced to migrate in search of a steady life doesn’t sound like a story told for the first time, nor is it the first to address the cause. But the moment you know how well they earn for themselves, you start sensing the difference. Given the interrelation between regional settings and poverty in our films, this one steps up its realism beyond conventional norms. However, having perfect characters is like hitting a bottleneck. No wonder you see their flaws or weaknesses generating ample conflict. They are homeless, strong-willed, but powerless against a system. Scapegoats of government policies, they desire dignified living in unstable times. Staying true to its essence, Khwada illustrates obstacles in life and the never-ending journey that ensues. Thankfully though, the subject doesn’t stand in the way of the narrative.If breaking down in one line, Khwada basically sums up as a good-versus-bad film with a difference. It follows an uncluttered format or no format at all. You witness hinterlands of rural Maharashtra. You see characters wandering with their livestock slowly and steadily, so much slow that you get enough time to brace yourself. In the absence of a standard plot, some beautifully-written elements unify as events which, in turn, help shape the bigger story. The pace at which both characters and events unfold befits the flow. This very much reveals Bhaurao Karhade’s familiarity with the topic and his understanding of screenwriting. His familiarity with relationships, psyches, backdrop, politics reflect well through his writing and to some extent on screen as well. He does whatever he could in his other task, pulling off a slew of noteworthy moments. That said, his inexperience does create a contrasting picture otherwise. Certain mannerisms emerge as staged. The good part is that these imperfections are not quite noticeable and you remain with the story.The visual beauty of this film dwells in its rawness, with each shot trying to create the unrest and act as a distinct character. But what I liked more is that the photography doesn’t hinder the storytelling. For a major part, a conscious effort is taken in order to make the film look dull, tedious. Camera tries to impart characters’ strain visually and you don’t even realise that for a long period. Perhaps due to the obstacles faced during the making, you end up seeing a few discontinuities from camera’s perspective to that of director’s. Despite the lack of resources at their disposal and some technical downsides, it deserves all the praise it has been garnering all the while.One thing that can perhaps defy one’s cinematic senses or disappoint entirely is its treatment. A well-conceived approach, calling it non-dramatic would be an understatement. A story of this nature sans classic drama could seem stale, but not in this film. Now what is drama and what isn’t is quite subjective, Khwada shatters our perception of it. In the age of musical overflow, at times you listen to nothing more than a low-pitched background score. But the absence of sound in the climax reaps the rewards. This is certainly not the first of its kind, but it’s good to see it used here.I generally refrain myself from festival-film or art house or masala to describe films. I would instead like to put Khwada as another good film. The film has enough potential on hold its own.

The uneven story and sermons take away from what the film wants to say.,"If you watch Ki & Ka as a film on gender equality you are very likely to be peeved off. However, if you look at it as a crusade for the “sitting at home” housewives, then it has a certain case to make. It looked like it was aiming for the former. And misses big time. Even so, if even a handful of us (not just men) took the “not just sitting around” housewives point home, it is progress. If a few of us took the “being comfortable in your skin even when you are sitting around” point home, even better. You can see Ki & Ka counter the very points it tries to make. While you could think of the contradictions as society's struggle with accepting a change in its perception, it feels like you are giving the film too much credit. They seem more like slip-ups in the writer's thought process. These inconsistencies are across the board - in the broader strokes Ki & Ka paints and in the way characters behave. Both Ki-a and Ka-bir go completely uncharacteristically berserk at different points in the film. The tantrums and the resolutions are jolting and seem off balance in an otherwise supposedly mature relationship. This is after accounting for the fact that they are humans - they are allowed to go out of character, once in a while. In that sense, insecurity creeping in, even if it is at its immature best, is understandable too. It simmers well before blowing up. It is the proportion that catches you off-guard. An insight at the end of the film sums it up really well.  Only, if only, it hadn't felt like a sermon. Then there is this one other scene that beautifully sums up all that Ki & Ka wants to say. I was in awe through that scene because of what we know from real life about the actors in it. Saying any more, will give the scene away, so I leave it for you to discover even if as a stand-alone clip on YouTube some day. The performances overall are quite in place. I am too warm with nostalgia to comment about Swaroop Sampat's performance. I'll just say this - she has a cool-yet-motherly presence about her. From scene one, where Kareena Kapoor's character does not want to dance to when she goes completely mental (even if it is out of character) she does well. In fact, you quite forget you are watching Kareena Kapoor as you are try to figure Kia out. Arjun Kapoor, as the laid back, 100% comfortable with being laid back Kabir, does well too. These performances are good enough, to leave the inconsistencies for analysis after you have seen the film and, to watch it for what it is for now. Annoyingly enough, you take the trouble of letting go and try to be a spectator to Kia and Kabir's life to suddenly find yourself in an advertisement. What is with all the product placements! Some subtle and some not so subtle. As jarring as they are you try to ignore them the best you can and try to grapple with this comment on the way we are. Confident go-getter Kia becomes insecure almost at the drop of a hat. And cool-cat Kabir is confident even as a man-child. Isn't this how it is? Many, if not most, women have to work hard to be secure and men are raised as confident people? Is this what Ki & Ka was getting at subtly? Was this intentional or coincidental?Even if it was unintentional, the choice to present that insight on being human, on relationships and the one scene that is pretty much unforgettable take Ki & Ka to a likable level. Yet, every time a thick wall was built between the earner and the caretaker, I was reminded of this couple I saw with a  baby recently. Everything was division of labour - I fed the baby in the morning, you do it in the evening; I put the baby to bed three days in a row, now you do it. Is that what relationships are? Two people can't do the same thing together? Both can't earn? Both can't take care of chores? Which is why Ki & Ka comes across more as a pat on the back of housewives. Much needed as that pat is - and I can't over-emphasize that - it doesn't make the film a rom-com and it certainly doesn't make it a balanced take on relationships.

553,651,651,651,651,Kick,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma reviewNotepadPreview30 Critic Reviews 2.8/5.0 5 Reader Reviews 3/5.0 59 Tweet Reviews 4.0/5.0,/movie/kick-review/,2.8/5.0,3/5.0,4.0/5.0,3.266666667,It is a Salman Khan film + a tiny little more. ,"It is that time for the year again, when I go through the futile exercise of reviewing a Salman Khan film. The thing is those who want to watch it, will watch it anyways and you couldn't pay those who don't want to watch it, to do so (why would you want to do that anyway?) Kick is as typical a Salman Khan film as it gets, plus a tad bit of a story, a tad bit of an attempt at keeping things sorted, a tad bit of an attempt at acting more than usual by Salman Khan (not that I was expecting it). He enters in style. He stays, he swaggers and he mouths his sytlish lines in style. No one else matters, though they technically do try and succeed if only the audience cared. I must confess, I think I finally get what the Salmania is all about. The very thing that gets on my nerves - his complete lack of acting skills. Tell me I got this right - he knows that he cannot act and he knows that he can get away with it - this is what makes Salman Khan, Salman Khan. Right? The over-confidence. When I saw him try to emote a little more than usual, even I felt like whistling. No, that's not the magic of Salman Khan. That's the magic of rock-bottom expectations. Oh and listening to him speak in English is refreshing too. It is such a relief not to listen to the lines that you see in the trailer, repeated every 10 minutes to remind us how cool Salman Khan is. In fact, some of the lines are actually enjoyable even if you discount for the fact that the rest of the entire theater is in splits or on a trip of its own cheering in delight, irrespective of what's happening on screen.  They are hooting in joy at anything and everything.Should I then, discount also my joy that the whole theater went into an uproar at Nawazuddin Siddiqui's entry? Even with his short appearance, he leaves a remarkable impression. As a part of his quirky character, he makes this sound every once in a while. It was hilarious to have the audience repeat the sound every time he came on screen. Now, that is audience engagement at a completely different level. Notice, how a lot of the film's experience comes from how the audience reacts to it (even if they have come pre-determined to have a good time). As I sit here, writing this review, I wonder if I'd have given the film any of the few points, if I hadn't seen a 600-seater enjoy it completely. Would I have enjoyed the film for what it is? Nope. Because ultimately, for me the film is about the story and how it is told. And both these bits were highly irksome.Yes, we are back to 'thinking' in a Salman Khan film. How do I stop my brain from working when I see Salman Khan's character, Devi beat the living daylights out of a bunch of people for being onlookers to eve-teasing before he beats the offenders themselves, when in the next sequence he is pretty much stalking a woman? The first half of the film is pretty much that. Devi wooing Shaina, a psychiatrist, one of whose first lines in the film is, ""Mental ho kya?"" (Do you have a mental problem?) No wonder this professional's dad is looking to either provide for her himself or look for a husband who will earn enough for her to live by. I would have tried to make an assessment of the lead lady's performance, but she is so inconsequential, despite having a good hour revolving around her, that it just doesn't matter.In that sense, Kick is actually two stories that is force-fitted to make a feature length film. One is girl-met-boy story, the other a good-vs-evil. So, disconnected are these that they don't even bother mentioning the latter bit in the first half and the former part only happens to be lying around in the good-vs-evil part of the film. The only connecting bit is Randeep Hooda's character, Himanshu Tyagi. He looks good and does his part with the apt amount of smug. Within each story too, there are enough continuity jerks and logical loopholes to make a 1000-word article of its own. When they do try fill us in on the logic, you wish they didn't. So, might as well stick to the aims and objectives of the audience is, ""leave brain behind, whistle and enjoy"", so what a waste of an effort would that be.Other than that, all of Kick feels stilted as if its very aware that it is a Salman Khan film. The songs come in and out in appropriate commercial doses. The cinematography is better than what you would expect from a film of the Salman Khan genre, but that doesn't give the film as a whole, too many bonus points. I didn't like Kick much + the other 599 in the theater loved it (with the two girls by my side, making plans to see it again on Tuesday) = what say, 300 crores?

The film does have its fun moments, though the treatment - similar to but not nearly as audacious as the first film – isn’t likely to find very many takers. ","The 2010 Kick-Ass, directed by Matthew Vaughn, caught attention because of how audacious it was in the violence and profanity-laced comedy it had to offer. It has since gone on to acquire something of a cult status. (If I remember correctly, it had also made it to Quentin Tarantino’s ‘Favourite Movies of 2010’ list.) Though I wouldn’t call myself a fan of the first film by any stretch, the film had quite amused me with its brand of no-holds-barred comedy and violence. (Not to mention that I’m always enamoured by the superhero concept, even if the treatment is tongue-in-cheek.)The problem with the sequel, which has a new director in Jeff Wadlow – and which one can question the very existence of, apart from obvious financial reasons – is that it sorely lacks what set the first film apart. Audacity. The violence, comedy and outlandishness of the plot have been toned down to make it a bit more dramatic instead, with high school identity problems, paternal issues and the likes taking centre-stage instead. The film does have a few laughs to offer, of course, and with its runtime just a shade over a 100 minutes, it mercifully doesn’t test your patience too much, despite the odd cringe-worthy moments. Though the pace of the film is largely brisk, it really slows down when it pretends to look at the serious issues. You’re always waiting for everyone to come to terms with their identities already, so that they can get on with what makes the film fun – the ludicrous humour and action. Every character stays well over-the-idiomatic-top and that really is what makes the film a tolerable watch. Aaron Taylor-Johnson reprises Dave, and is still adorable. Chloë Grace Moretz pretty much steals the show as Hit Girl, with her action as well as spontaneous lines. Nicholas Cage, who played Hit Girl’s goofy father Big Daddy in the first film, is sorely missed. But to make up for his absence is the presence of one of my favourite movie stars of all time. I won’t reveal who, because I must confess, I had no idea he was in this film before I watched it. In case you don’t either, then I don’t want to ruin the surprise for you; because I nearly jumped out of my seat to cheer when he first appears in the film.Apart from the appearance of said movie star, the best moment of Kick-Ass 2 for me, was a line that appears on Dave’s t-shirt late in the film – again, something I’d rather you discover for yourself. Though Kick- Ass 2 is nowhere close to the first film, if you enjoyed the Kick-Ass, there is a possibility that you’ll like this one as well. Otherwise you might find the film too profane, too violent or just too silly. Some, though, just call that ‘niche’.

555,653,653,653,653,Kidnap,Watch when on TV/online,wogma reviewNotepadPreview14 Critic Reviews 0.7/5.0 2 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/kidnap-review/,0.7/5.0,4/5.0,,4.35,The crime-related questions that Kidnap asks are worth pondering over. But the glaring loopholes don't allow you to get absorbed completely.,"Kidnap does raise interesting questions. What is a small or a big unintentional mistake? Who decides the proportionate punishment? What if the punishment is disproportionate? To what extent should the injustice be set right? What can set it right? Maybe there are straight answers theoretically. Now what if you are the wronged person? What if the stakes are made higher with your child/ person closest to your heart is involved? But, in the tug-of-war between asking these questions and adding commercial masala, the latter pulled harder. And we have a decent story with not-so-decent execution. Despite the superficial presentation, it's very intriguing to see the movie balancing in the gray zone. There's no hero and no villain. At the most there are two anti-heroes. You can't hate or love either of them, but somehow you aren't indifferent either. You want to know what they've learnt, and how they've changed at the end of the events. Sanjay Dutt perfectly balances between the street-smart, conniving businessman, Vikrant Raina and the vulnerable father. True Kabir (Imran Khan) is written in good detail, he is supposed to be cynical and all. But in the eagerness to stylize the character Imran Khan's dialogue delivery comes across as very forced. The mid-sentence pauses meant to add attitude, manage to add to the unnaturalness. The narrative, and not Imran's performance, show how a wrong or harsh decision by one person can affect another person's life. So much so that the latter is obsessed with completely bringing down the other person emotionally. Unfortunately though, other parts of the writing department leave gaps in the narrative. There are a few courtesy smart lines thrown in with a full dose of inanities. What was the point of the clues? It wasn't as if one was leading to another. How the clues are solved is not clarified. And later there are clues that are not even cryptic - they are direct messages. Then why even call it a clue?Also, there are women in the ring too, and they have reasonable-sized screen presence; but their characters aren't really serving any deeper purpose. Minissha Lamba absolutely behaves like a 18 year old spoilt brat, but she certainly doesn't look like one. How many ever wet-scenes-in-white she has or however unclad she is, she doesn't ooze oomph. Skin show is very in-the-face generally but there is something very ungraceful about it here. Her inelegant dance moves don't help either. And she certainly cannot take on Kareena Kapoor, Amisha Patel or even Aishwarya Rai in this department.I'm still in shock after seeing Vidya Malavade play Minissha's mom! Though it's a very courageous move, again the deep-necked business suits have been capitalized rather than her acting skills. So, the sum total of cleavage is tasteless and rather functional. The movie doesn't carry the rugged look that the promos have. It has a very color-saturated feel. That the kidnapped has a full wardrobe - matching shoes included - to her disposal adds to that feel. Did the kidnapper go shopping for her? Or did he take a pit-stop at her home on his way to where he was going to hide her? And who changed her clothes the first time? These things wouldn't usually make it into a review, but they are so blatant that they add significantly to the already unrealistic feel. Oh yeah, there are enough engagements and wedding anniversaries thrown in to have songs with lousy music. Unrealistic has its advantages though. A couple of actions scenes are really well choreographed and thought out. Bikes and cars are made to do a few imaginative stunts. And human beings aren't left out. The chase scene set in an under-construction building actually has Imran doing Spiderman moves.If only, they could have resisted over-stylizing it. Or maybe this is just a hangover from the director's last endeavor Dhoom 2 and this is a first step towards having an actual story in an action-thriller.

Add songs at random spots, loud background score,   louder dialogue delivery and you have a film that disappoints you with every passing frame. Kill Dil doesn't start out like that though. The opening scenes are actually perfectly quirky with slick cinematography and crisp editing. It makes you sit up and take in all that is happening on screen. Until, Govinda enters, which is about 5-7 minutes into the film. I'm not saying it is because of Govinda's entry that things go downhill, it is a coincidence that the moment the trio Govinda-Ranveer Singh-Ali Zafar start singing one of the title songs, that you wonder how come this sudden drop to slapstick zone? After that, for quite some time, I tried to make sense of the absolute lameness of how the story was moving until I caught myself trying too hard to like the film owing to the first five minutes.Every once in a while, there is an odd dialogue that brings a smile. Ranveer Singh's overt attempt at being cute, charms intermittently too. But, the overall plot, zero attempt at building any intrigue, the unremarkable characters topped off with outlandish songs popping in from nowhere, just kills any attempt by the audience to enjoy the film. For instance, Parineeti Chopra's character, Disha just exists. She has zero role to play in how the others are behaving but all the credit and discredit goes to Disha. Similarly, Tutu (Ali Zafar) is the protagonist, Dev's (Ranveer Singh) best friend, his alter ego too, but Tutu comes across as just incidental. Dev himself and more so his transformation seems arbitrary. Everything he does comes across as something a character in his situation in any film, ought to have done. His actions seem rather functional.Fortunately, the performances keep things at the borderline of tolerable. Govinda instills fear as he is supposed to but by the end goes over-the-top and the drama gets over-bearing. Ali Zafar is the most subdued of the lot. While it is refreshing to watch him in a non-chocolate-boy kind-of a role, facial hair taking it a long way, his performance very soon boils down to the same old expressions. Ranveer Singh, like I said, charms but the character is too loosely written for him to do much with it. The biggest waste of talent here is Parineeti Chopra. Not only because this is a role she must have sleep-walked through but also because her character is just inconsequential.You are left then with just a few one-liners strewn across that have the potential to bring a smile. Some stylish cinematography and background music in the first few minutes that resort to tacky and loud respectively by the end of the film. And the end itself of the film is pretty lame. Story lines like Kill Dil had started losing their charm 30+ years ago. I am still not able to get over the fact that Shaad Ali and team, couldn't add one new angle to make it look like a product for and by the next generation.

Gets a lot of detail right but lingers around a bit much.,"Adolscence is probably on the of the most unexplored phases of life in films. That is surprising considering it has a lot of nostalgic value and will appeal to a lot of adults. Killa manages to tug that chord. Yet, what stays after the film are the visuals - that is not necessarily the best thing that can be said about a film.Killa captures the gorgeousness of Sahyadris' coastal end with the gaze of a person who is in love with the plush seaside. And when it is does not have the natural beauty, the frame is lit and composed like it was a painting to be framed. A lot of detail is captured in the little things that you'd find in a lower middle class household of rural Maharastra. The little steel cups used to drink water; the way a lady sets up a gas cylin; the process a fisherman goes through before casting a net – are just a few examples. A lot of nuance is captured in the mannerisms of the actors and how they react and emote. While Amruta Subhash and Archit Deodhar are amazing with their restraint, Parth Bhalerao is simply mesmerizing by the way his jaw drops or his hand lingers. You instantaneously judge the kind of 11-12 year old boy he would be. I was reminded of watching an Indian Idol Junior show where my jaw dropped at a 9 year old performance, “how is that even possible!?” That's exactly how I reacted to Parth's act too. Beyond that Killa has a few moments that just get you to sit up and notice – whether it is a moment of bonding between mother and pre-teen son or a group of mischievous young boys. You are certainly going to find a moment or two of nostalgia – yes, the good ol' days.However, this phase isn't as romantic when you are going through it, remember? Puberty and the thousand tribulations it brings. Not being a child any more. Physical attraction. But, Killa doesn't touch any of these in detail. It just aims to be and is “a monsoon in the life of a young boy.” For a huge part, it seems to focus more on the monsoon bit than the young boy. While it is pretty beyond expression, the monsoon lingers on a bit too much for a film. I'd much rather spend time in nature than watch nature on screen. Of course, you do see young Chinmay (Archit Deodhar) take in the new world around him, you see him struggle to make sense of a world without a loved one, a world where he is forced to make new connections, again and again. Yet, Killa makes you feel you have seen very little, like a lot was left unexplored. This is without even brining in comparisons from films like Balak Palak or Vihir or Shaala or their Hindi second cousin like Udaan. In absolute terms to, Killa falls short after you've taken in the initial beauty of its frames. The question then boils down to how much more do you want your film to be above magnificent scenery – a little is good enough or you want a lot more? A little and a bit more, Killa gives you. A few months to come-of-age for a boy just about turning into a teenager – felt too little.

But if dark comedy is your thing, then Killing Them Softly is thoroughly enjoyable with some insanely sharp dialogue, good performances and a couple of super-stylish action set pieces.","Gangster Noir. Coppola and Scorsese showed us how it’s done. Tarantino turned it on its head. And every once in a while a Hollywood director comes along and screws it up, sending us running back to the masters for solace. For some reason, I expected writer-director Andrew Dominik’s latest film, Killing Them Softly to belong to the latter category. My expectations dove further south after a prominent director, the maker of one of this year’s most loved and talked-about Hindi films, tweeted saying that it was one of the most boring films he had seen. How glad I am that I watched the film anyway.Killing Them Softly is easily one of the sharpest, smartest-written films of the year. Dialogue-heavy, yes, but at no point does the film get boring. Also, the film has one of the best-ever endings seen in recent times.Two small-time thugs, played excellently by Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn, attempt a heist a little above their station – robbing a poker game involving the mafia - after an older operator manages to convince them that someone else would take the fall for it. The amateurs, however, don’t know just what they’ve gotten themselves into. A professional mob enforcer, a hitman – Brad Pitt, dressed in all black, effortlessly ‘cool’ - is roped in by the Big Guys to look into the matter and bring the perpetrators to book, so to speak. The razor-sharp dialogue, mostly tongue-in-cheek, manages to keep the long character interactions interesting at all times. And every once in a while comes an action set-piece that can make your jaw drop. Interestingly, the film’s timeline runs with the Barack Obama - George W. Bush Presidential race, the run-up to Obama eventually being elected President of the United States of America. What that does is give every character and every line a context. So there is generous talk of the recession hitting even the mob business, falling rates of pro-assassins in these hard times and of course, the fact that in the US, ultimately it is all about the money. What the film really gets right is the feel of it. The frames aren’t picture perfect; they are meant to be gritty. Every shot in the film has primarily been set up to create the mood. The cool it eventually oozes is a by-product of having good actors delivering great lines without making it go over the top. Brad Pitt is first-rate as the ice-cold, no-nonsense hitman roped in by the mob to look into the issue of the heist. It is the kind of role that harnesses Pitt’s natural charm, and his deadpan expression goes well with his uber-cool look. He makes a late-ish entry in the film, and his larger-than-life persona is largely kept in check, so that he doesn’t come off looking like the ‘hero’ of the film. James Gandolfini as the expensive hitman from out-of-town, now well past his prime because of his alchohol-and-hooker addiction is excellent as well. Also good to see is Ray Liotta as the gangster who runs the poker game that eventually gets robbed by the amateurs. However, it is easy to understand why the director I mentioned earlier didn’t like the film. Indeed, there will be more like him. And you’ll know in the first ten minutes if the film is going to work for you or not. Right from the word go, the lines mouthed by the characters are sharp quips meant to evoke a certain amount of quiet mirth. If you aren’t smiling at the coolth of it all from the beginning of the film, there is very little else that you are going to like about it apart from some well-shot action portions, which are few in number in any case. But if you are drawn in from the start, then this is the kind of film that you would be itching to watch again.

559,657,657,657,657,[The] King and The Commissioner,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review3 Reader Reviews 2/5.0,/movie/king-and-commissioner-review/,,2/5.0,,1.933333333,"Two behemoths of Malayalam cinema reprise their previous hit roles in The King & The Commissioner. Mammootty and Suresh Gopi rarely put a foot wrong in this otherwise tedious and tiresome film. While fans would probably find it worth a watch just for the ferocity with which the superstars essay their roles, this is not exactly the kind of film I would recommend to those new to cinema of the South.","The King & The Commissioner is a hard film to critique. While there is very little in the film worthy of a mention, almost of all of its flaws are pounded to a pulp by its two superstar leads – Mammootty and Suresh Gopi. But then let’s face it – that is pretty much what they do best – pound things to a pulp, with punches or with punch lines.The pair reprise earlier hit characters from separate films of theirs, only this time, they are brought together in the interest of the nation (and the producers of the film, no doubt.) Still brash, still arrogant and still stylish, Mammootty’s Joseph Alex is now a top bureaucrat. He has been put on a special mission by the Prime Minister of India (played by our very own Mohan Agashe) and is to be aided in his cause by none other than Bharathchandran, played by Suresh Gopi – now on ‘Special Assignment’ and yes, still brash, still arrogant and if possible, even more stylish.There is absolutely no denying that nearly everything is wrong with this film. Right from the opening reels of the film where Pakistanis with Malayali accents reveal their goal of terrorizing India, the film’s treatment and screenplay is all over the place. It is one of those bits of writing where it seems like a lot is happening, when very little is - too many caricature-ish characters, too much talk, but very little meat. Sinfully long at nearly three-and-a-quarter hours, it can be an extremely exhausting film to watch. Far too verbose for its own good, its woes are compounded with a host of unnecessary scenes and subplots that pepper proceedings right till the very end. The film should ideally (and could easily) have been about two hours long. The other big problem with the film is the technical aspect. Insanely over-shot and over-cut, this is the kind of film whose shot breakdown I’d die to get my hands on and whose editor I’d love to have a private chat with. It would be extremely enlightening to know exactly how he came up with the idea for those umpteen cuts where the screen is split into ways that would make a butcher feel terribly low about himself.Far more serious is the way in which names have been taken in this film. Pakistan is clearly the villain, with no attempt at being mellow towards them for the sake of diplomacy in the real world. If the promos of Agent Vinod got them riled up enough to ban it, this film could severely hamper Indo-Pak ties for good if they ever happened to chance upon it. Not to mention some vicious attacks on a few public figures who’ve been in the news in the recent past. This film has clearly been made to play to the galleries, which is a pity. The makers had two megastars who would have set the cash registers jingling in any case. They could have used this golden opportunity to make a film that was topical, relevant and engaging without resorting to needless sensationalism.But then, when the two stars are on screen, really, all else pales. The two are clearly in their zones in this film. They thunderously deliver the over-the-top lines with ease, often making you forget how unnecessary the lines actually were in the first place. Yes, both well past 50 and both have paunches.  The remarkable thing however is that they don’t look ungainly in action sequences at all. Suresh Gopi, in particular, looks extremely at ease decimating a dozen baddies without breaking a sweat. The two of them also have the phenomenal ability to make others in the frame look good, no matter how silly they otherwise are. Their presence radiates and enhances people around them, even if the people are mediocre by themselves. Nothing, really, can take away from the fact that these two fine National Award-winning actors are as much at ease playing these over-the-top commercial characters as they are playing real characters in sensible and sensitive stories.The King & The Commissioner as a film is a lot like some of the action scenes in it – two towering personalities standing in a sea of mediocrity. It is the kind of film that I would recommend only to those who would not need any recommendation to watch it at all – they would have watched it any way. For others, particularly for those who like to believe that they are above all the shenanigans that big stars in big films indulge in, I’d recommend settling in with a nice, quiet book instead.

560,658,658,658,658,[The] King's Speech,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review3 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/kings-speech-review/,,4/5.0,,2.6,"Watching The King’s Speech is like watching the gentleman’s game at Lord’s. It’s quintessentially British - every nip and tuck deserving of applause - carefully fleshed out to result into a genuinely feel good film about a King’s bond with a commoner to overcome his speech impediment. Brilliant performances by Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush, and a screenplay by the very gifted David Steidler, this film pleased the Oscar jury like none other. You may rush to the theatres to watch it while it’s still playing, and put a fashionable Facebook update :)","You know those lists newspapers recommend during Teacher’s Day? ‘Films based on the role of teachers’, etc., where they will mention films such as To Sir With Love, Black, Karate Kid, etc. Well, add a new film to that list - em>The King’s Speech. It’s a heartwarming, feel-good movie about a king resorting to an ordinary man’s help to overcome a speech disability, so that he can deliver an important speech to his countrymen.It’s what I call the ‘pure gentleman’s film’, steeped in British royalty, since it concerns the Duke of York (Colin Firth in an Oscar winning performance) and Queen Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter, the most gentle, kind and determined wife). Right from the background score, to the sets, to the wry humor about knighthood, to the psychological divide between the royalty and the masses - it is the most typically British film, I’ve seen in recent times. (The Queen was the last gem, that comes to mind.)The film works because of its performances, witty writing and the character improvisations. Colin Firth is outstanding, as is his speech therapist, Lionel (played by Geoffrey Rush). On paper, Lionel’s character is certainly far more interesting and this is established in scenes where the screenplay allows him to stand his ground and treat the Duke as a student / patient, than as royalty with whom he needs to watch his manners.Writer David Seidler uses Lionel not only to transform the Duke into a deserving King who can speak his mind, but also to make subtle commentary about the ridiculous customs of the monarchy, its values which have now outstayed their welcome in the 21st Century. The most remarkable quality about his writing is that despite being based on a true story during the World War, Lionel’s approach at dealing with the royalty seems extremely contemporary, rooted in the current times.A special word about cinematographer Danny Cohen’s characteristic wide angles used consistently throughout the film. And that special word is, marvellous. It’s spectacular how the camerawork adapts to the Duke’s speech correction - at the beginning, the wide angles almost bloat up his head every time he is facing the camera, a sign that he is losing his mind, in frustration of his stammering habit exposed to the public. As he embraces Lionel’s controversial methods of treatment, the wide angles slowly disappear and you begin to see a King, chin up.It is Colin Firth’s film, throughout. He is as convincing as a cat that has caught its tongue, and his transition from an embarrassed, nervous wreck, to a man who forges a bond with Lionel and becomes worthy of ownership of his throne, is classic. Mid-way through the film, I thanked my stars (and my tongue) because the realisation dawned that speech, oratory skills and language have been at the core of the greatest resistances and revolutions in history. And they continue to do so.The King’s Speech is undoubtedly a great film, but I do not think it is something you HAVE to watch on the big screen. I usually prefer films that do not require me to pause crunching my popcorn, just so that I have to hear the dialogue clearly. A deserving big screen watch is a film with some element of action, music, adventure or fantasy, that makes the experience immersive. The King’s Speech, largely filmed indoors, doesn’t present any of those attributes - and therefore, in my view, does not command compulsive viewing in theatres, especially not in near-empty ones its playing at, in the on-going World Cup season. I suspect the original DVD may release soon - banking on the Oscar acclaim - and you could have a far more holistic experience, rounding it up with the behind the scenes and how-did-you-pull-it-off interviews with Colin Firth.But before I conclude, I must address a crucial question: Did this film deserve the epitome of Oscar glory this year? My answer is a firm no. Not because it is not a good film - it raises many a chuckle, mostly tongue-in-cheek, but never a WOW.  The Social Network, Inception, Black Swan are some films that do make us go WOW, and on many occasions even make us cringe in our seats, shield our eyes and most importantly, forget that there’s popcorn and Coke on the armrest. That’s immersive, in the true sense.

In the bargain, America, of course, would save the world and validate the truth of the American Way and the American Dream.
In the Cold War it was the Russians, the Syrians / Arabs (check out True Lies) came next, and now it is the Al Qaeda and its free floating associates.  The movie is set in Saudi Arabia, the Kingdom in the title, with very few scenes in the US of A.  Peter Berg is a director who seems to be very fond of hand held shots, and uses them liberally, with the result that camera shakes and actors sliding in and out of the frame becomes de rigueur in the film.  This effect works well in the action sequences, and also helps in building tension in parts of the film, but overall it is a bit too much for the viewer.   The script is predictable for the most part and has oft repeated themes in it.    The Saudi police men and the American FBI agent played by Jamie Foxx (an African American, a casting choice possibly influenced by the need to be politically correct) are shown as family men, the Americans and the Saudis initially distrust each other but then bonding takes place, cultural gaffes and clashes are shown as the Middle East and America come together, and so are palace intrigues in the Kingdom.  The Saudi police force comes across as professional, but rather hamstrung due to internal politics, while the Prince of the Kingdom sees every event as a photo opportunity.  On the American side, it portrays politicians as the ones who prevent good Americans from doing their jobs; all of which are themes as old as Adam himself.  But it is the Americans obviously who know what to do and how to do it, and it is they who end up doing what it takes to promote justice.  The Saudi police are reduced to passive cooperators having accepted the superiority of the Americans.  This part of the film moves as a FBI procedural, where the American agents demonstrate their technical expertise to catch the bad guys.  The last half an hour of the film explodes into action and the script remains predictable throughout right up to the end, but the action is well choreographed, the intensity evident, and the actors look as if they are really fighting for their lives.  The last five minutes of the film are a surprise; one does not expect such a comment from a mainstream Hollywood action film.  But it is there, and this coupled with the decent acting and the last action set piece sequence lifts the film a notch above an average action thriller.

Does it make it THE masala movie to watch. Na-ah. Tastes bland despite all the masala. Save an interesting, unexpected twist there ain't anything to savor.","It's interesting that despite having the run-of-the-mill two-brothers-differ-in-attitude storyline, Kisaan manages to spring a couple of surprises. Despite having the masala elements, it manages to bring in a couple of tragedies. A family is torn apart by the distance between the village and the city. Physical, emotional, financial, etc. Education within agricultural background. But, the silly jokes stereotyping the city-citizens' arrogance and the villagers' ignorance get tiring. One brother's naïveté and the other brother's love for violence gets a bit too convenient to aid in wrapping up the film. Letting misunderstandings brew, being blind to manipulation is one's forte. And the other and his enemy just like snapping off anyone who offends them. And yet there are some interesting turns. But again, the climax is extremely handy. Very simplistic. Ultra-hurried.  None of the characters are complex enough to require any great performance from anyone. So, from Jackie Shroff to the Khan brothers to Dia Mirza they all just run through the mechanics. Whether or not any of them are capable or not, is another question all together. And yet amongst three men in the lead roles, Dia Mirza's character Priya has a role of some minimal substance. But everything from this to the main plot seems very superficial and cursory. I cannot leave this place without mentioning how annoying the background music was. People, just because it's Punjab you don't need a few hundred extra dholak-wallas in the orchestra! 
It's a debate. Whether to applaud the unpredictability they've attempted and partially succeeded at. Or to hate the predictability when they do the clichés. Had they done something more spectacular with the unexpected turn of events, it might have been worth a try. And since that's missing, there isn't anything I can ask you to look forward to.

Vidya Balan blends Janvi of LRM with Suman of Munnabhai MBBS. Shahid Kapoor plays chocolate hero, again! Aziz Mirza is still in I'm directing Shah Rukh Khan mode.","Staring at the computer. Checking the thesaurus. Wrecking my brain. Checking thesaurus again. There is really no other word for ""predictable"" that wholesomely describes Kismat Konnection's story, dialogues, character transformations, etc, etc, etc. The title clearly says that it's all konnected by kismat. So, no points for asking why it is set in Canada (or should that be Kanada?)Which also means that you are demented if you complain about all the happy coincidences when boy meets girl, loses her, wins her back or maybe not. But looks like, asking for 'unique' coincidences is asking for too much. Movies like these have been our staple diet when we were growing up, dear movie makers! It's high time you begin respecting that and show us something more. And just zip up on the tacky symbolic lights-out-luck-down, lights-on-fate-bright bit! It truly makes my eyes hurt from rolling.And the dialogues have the same effect, when my brain involuntarily says out the words two seconds before the characters do. Before, I can control it from doing so. Hell, let alone the dialogues, the lyrics of the songs are just prose set to tunes, and have no poetry. And, the music didn't work for me in the promos and didn't work for me while watching the movie. Well, it's not like this one doesn't have its moments. Juhi Chawla and the lines given to her had me in splits for the 7 minutes she was on screen. Then there's this one scene where Vidya Balan's character, Priya describes her idea of an ideal match, which culminates into a lovely romantic moment. But those are about the 9 minutes that I enjoyed in the movie. The other romantic moments are either as if no one in the movie's team has been romantic after the 80s (stuffed toys as gifts, p-l-e-a-s-e!). Or real romance is so cheesy that it's better to portray this dream world where a squeaky toy can make a heart-broken girl smile than think of genuine romantic situations.Vidya Balan is one actor who can convey sensuousness through her facial expressions and doesn't really need a 'hot' body to convey that. Which means you need no leather pants in your wardrobe, lady! She looks great though, or at least much better than I thought she would after Heyy Babyy. Thanks to the camera decisions of mostly focusing on her upper body and more so the charming face. And that's the end of intelligent or smart camerawork decisions. Because, the lighting had this uncanny way of making the streets of Canada look like they were studio sets. Or were they actually sets? And it's obvious that director Aziz Mirza has gotten so used to directing Shah Rukh Khan that almost through half the movie, I had to remind myself that it's Shahid Kapoor I'm watching. And it completely doesn't work when he tried to pull an Amitabh Bachchan from Namakhalal by spouting fast monologues on a sport. But then, there's this thing that Shahid's eyes do that make you wish he gets the girl even if it's the most expected thing to happen story-wise. Yet the puppy eyes fail to convince me that he's this struggling architect who magically owns a largish house in Canada, a convertible, a large screen TV and yet is broke. So, you're not allowed to forget that the operative word in the title is ""Kismat"" - luck, fortune, destiny, whatever you would like to call it as the opening, boring voiceover monologue by Shah Rukh Khan reminds you. klearly kommon kismat konnection is more like it.

Such is the whole drama that you begin to doubt your potential to fall in love, let alone caring about who the protagonist should fall in love with. All this in the 80s style of filming and loving.","Right from one of the cheesiest title sequences of the past few years, second only to maybe Welcome you can tell you are going to paraphrase the title from ""Who should I love?"" to kisse badla loon? ""Who should I avenge?"". But yet we are fair around here, so we don't pass judgment until we've seen it through to the end credits. No respite in sight. Oh well... What is so bad about the film? I think it'll just be easier to start with what's good about the film. Well, you can see Arshad Warsi's comic timing genius when he's trying to make the best of the sorriest lines ever. Especially when he tries to muster half-a-smile out of you with the references to masturbation. Why he does this to himself (no pun intended), I'm willing to give my right tiny toe to know. Ashish Chodary ... ok, now that's not a typo nor is it me trying to crack a good one, that's how his name is spelt in the opening credits! Anyway, Ashish - I admire him for his capacity to make a fool out of himself - film after film after film - playing a dog fetching biscuits or just acting human-silly. Anyway, you can't associate too much intelligence with someone who's signed a script like this. Ditto for Yash Tonk. The women do what women in such films do - play dumb, hold one expression throughout as if they are charged a fine if they changed it. Same rules seemed to have been applied to the costume designer who was told to make the most unwearable outfits possible. The story line of course is that these three are friends and generate loads of money though they don't really have a means of livelihood. Sorry, I digress. One of them falls in love with a girl who can't stand the sight of the other two. And so the battle begins. But since this is not enough masala to make a 80s film, we have a villain, an inspector, and a godfather thrown in. And since it is after all not a film from the 80s, we have random references to them sprinkled across. Actually it's wrong to call the references random because that'd be like saying only they are random. The entire product is one huge display of arbitrary  human misbehavior. What exactly is anyone thinking while writing, directing, producing something like this is beyond me. Just plain incomprehensible.

But the story doesn't fly that high. The twists and turns are mere ploys to get to an end that was decided before the first chapter was written.,"Perdón , Hrithik Roshan fans. Really sorry, your wait for a good Hrithik film just got longer by a few more years. The setting is beautiful and so is the cast. The beginning also makes you eager. I was completely bowled over by the rugged and necessary clueless look Hrithik wore in the opening sequence. And this was despite the absolutely captivating cinematography. The standard set by the beginning was really exciting. Hrithik is in trouble in the sandy deserts of Nevada, we don't know why. His voiceover introduces us to the small-time crook that he used to be on the strip in Las Vegas. But, all doesn't end well. I'm ok with the climax by itself, but getting there was like being on a sedative.I won't say that it went into downhill mode immediately after the first few minutes. Dramatic editing crept in once or twice, followed by the mandatory song and boggling dance by Hrithik-Boneless-Roshan. These hints should have warned me not to take the film too seriously, despite the obvious effort. And there were a few more too. But, the interval felt like it came much earlier than expected and that's usually a good sign. The pace was just about perfect - the romance lingered and I could sense my ""aawww""; the mini-twists came with quick and sharp jerks. And I was really looking forward to an enjoyable fare. But you must have guessed how this story went. The thing is, a cliché is a cliché in any language. It remains so even if is in the sexiest accent. And it continues to bear the same character even if it is sub-titled. The dialogue is pretty much inane. And while there are some really cute moments and there are others where you can see the attempt to make it ""different"", there are some very ""typical"" situations. Usually, a premise for a film or any story, in fact, is set up. Like say, ""What if an Indian boy meets a Mexican girl?"" And then you play around with the possibilities. But here it's more like esimerp (ok, sorry, bad one!). It's all reverse engineered. Looks like first came marketing - Rs. is passé, $ is what we want - and make ourselves sincerely believe that we are doing it to bring Indian cinema to a world audience. Next, let's have this particular climax of the half-dozen ways in which a romance can end. Now let's play conflict-conflict. Eureka let's twist the standard by 2.5 degrees. Caste no bar, money no bar, religion no bar, whole-freaking country no bar. Let the objecting parties be a third person's family! And let's chop from situation to situation whenever we cannot get any more unreasonable. I shudder to think what the shorter English version will be like. Though the non-linear narration is used with style to create interest, the focus is at the wrong place. The ""what's happening now"" was much more interesting than ""how we got here"". But, the weightage given to both the sections needed to be reversed. Also, the twists that come in the last half an hour are lame and predictable due to the one-dimensional characters created. Kabir Bedi, Nick Brown and Kangna Ranaut is trying hard to be dysfunct. The ""trying"" part is because this section of the cast is too stiff. Every emotion is pretentious. And anyway, even if we feared the villains  the story completely punctures the anticipation. Hrithik and Barbara Mori do a fair job. The thing is that they look so good, that half their work is done right there. The rest of the stuff is taken care by tight close-ups. So, no body language needs to be used. Some of these tight shots work really well. Eyes mating, excitement brewing between the couple, the urge being kept under control unwillingly - all come out brilliantly. The kisses and making out are done with utmost comfort and is a much needed skill in Hindi films. On the flip side, was this done just to give the film an international appeal? If so, that's pretty lame, because they've been there, done that. Literally and figuratively - without the ""supposedly"" Indian moral bindings of undying love. Maybe that's what crossover cinema is all about. snicker Kites has super-slick production. Ace photography, definitely apt background music, intelligent editing, decent acting. I just cannot take anything away from the fact that it has outdone Love Story 2050, Blue and Drona, in terms of hopes created for high-budget visuals/effects and actual product.Uhhh, but…story, por favor?

As soon as that caught my eye, I decided to watch the film again (because the first time around it did nothing for me) – and I realized that maybe I was closing my eyes to the easy fun that this film proves to be. Hypocritical and narrow as that may be, it got me to realize that we might be just be too uptight towards film that are just breezy and fun and we end up being ignorant and accepting of genuine brain-dumbers. ","Leave your brains at home, is a phrase I detest. Unfortunately, I keep hearing it with regard to the many illogical films that have been resurfacing off late. As much as I wanted to make my protest loud and clear, I realized it might just be a bit premature. We all have our brainless entertainers, only assuming the term brainless means different things to different people - precisely why I thoroughly enjoyed the slick, pointless yet charming Knight and Day. In Knight and Day, Tom Cruise plays Roy Miller, a CIA agent on a mission. He meets June Havens, your average neighborhood girl (assuming all average neighborhood girls look like Cameron Diaz) at the Boston Airport, and while he uses her as a mule to carry an important device, here they begin their adventure. He whisks her from Boston to Brooklyn to the Caribbean and to Austria, now that she’s involved in the mission, and they fight out the mafia, FBI and miscellaneous villains. It’s a typical Tom Cruise film – and you’ve got to love it. While the film gathered more or less negative reviews, it got me thinking – since when did Tom Cruise films go out of fashion? He’s stylish, easy to please, and his charismatic presence makes you forget about logic and relevance. But who’s complaining? We jump from state to state, and mingle between their flirty-ness (which is admittedly a little damp between Diaz and Cruise). Each escapade later, Roy comes back for June, saves her from perennially being under the radar, and we find ourselves falling for him again. How can you not? Even Diaz, with her wide-eyed feminine glow makes you smile. Well, maybe if you find yourself feeling indifferent to the overt charm that this film oozes, its flaws will stare you in the eye. For example, no character apart from these two seems developed. There’s tons of pointless action, superhero moves on Cruise's part (hey, I’m trying to be neutral here) and most of all, every plot point in the film is guided by some illogical band-aid move to throw it forward. For example, you’ll notice in every tough situation, Miller will suddenly drug June, so she can escape having to face the situation. Cut to, June opening her eyes at home next day and we aren’t told how the situation was handled. The DVD has some fascinating extras – and hold your breath – it’s called “Wilder Knights and Crazier Days”. Some rib-tickling interviews with Cruise and Diaz, followed by on-screen bloopers and also a look into some of the stunts that Cruise and Diaz did themselves. The latter is an interesting watch, as we watch Diaz take on a car stunt for the first time, while Cruise, who’s known for doing his stunts by himself, breezes through. It only makes the film that much more believable and fun. Director James Mangold (of Walk the Line fame) seems to have his agenda straightened out. Knight and Day has a great looking pair, some crazy (flirtatious and charming) dialogue, theatrical action sequences and just charm, charm everywhere. The adventures are dramatic, over the top and ridiculously comical – in a good way (also depends on how you chose to see it). If you’re in the mood for it, Knight and Day will give you exactly what you want. It’s a genre that brings nothing more or less to the table – question the flaws, but enjoy it nonetheless.

Had I been able to get over that, I might've enjoyed the film for what it was trying to say. Even so, how it said the message and the baggage of righteousness it carried would have been a hindrance.","Hindi movies are repetitive and predictable. And yet they manage to surprise you. Knock out actually managed to get an awful performance out of Irrfan Khan. Yep! Disheartening, no? At first, I thought it was his ridiculous hairstyle I aren't being able to distract myself from. But, with the passing minutes it was difficult to let the haywire curls shoulder all the blame.While watching Irrfan Khan deteriorate, Sanjay Dutt's usual stylish, confident, goon act seemed like an award-winner. Kangna Ranaut? Oh, you mean her shrieks, weird dialogue delivery mechanism aka her pout? I just wanted her to go back to her drugged out, mentally ill characters. In fact, looks like she was missing those days too. She tried to pull one of those looks off, in a scene where she's supposed to be scared. After all of this there is only so much Sushant Singh's cool atitude can pull off? Also, one of the other main characters, the phone booth was way too lavish to portray the character's internal struggle or the claustrophobia he feels because of the person he is. Despite all of this, I'd say Knock Out is far better written than your average thriller. With any fiction, there still is a realm of reality within which the story should/or at least try to stay. The way around this, is ofcourse to spread the acceptability sphere so wide, that almost anything is possible from within. So, the whole world is at Sanjay Dutt's disposal. By definition, his act is so well planned, that you cannot question his capabilities of being ready for almost anything. When you cannot question the character's capacities, all you are left with is the bare bone plot. Knock out had a strong-ish hold on that one till they gave way to all of mother cliché's children. The spiels wouldn't stop and to ace it, you had one character actually say, ""I haven't called you to preach!"". Yeah, right! Yet, Knock out covers a lot of ground. It touches upon the cool aloofness of the CCD-generation towards bomb-blasts and such everyday happenings, till something completely out of the ordinary happens - like a suited-guy does a ridiculous dance in the middle of the road. It goes on to show how self-centered we are in our roles - whether we are news reporter or a police officer. We want to keep control, irrespective of the life-and-death situation at hand - as long as it is not ours. This becomes clearer when a direct question is posed ""my career vs. nation's future"" The character chooses the latter and you go 'baah!' Which is when I realized how truly self-absorbed we are when we cannot even accept our fictional characters giving up on personal aspirations. Yet, towards the end I was thinking. So, what if, what happens in this film actually comes true? What will we as a country do about it? How will we as citizens hold the new people in-charge accountable? Now, when a movie has made you think that one bit about the topic it's about, it has done something right, even if it is a teeny-weeny bit.

568,666,666,666,666,Kochadaiiyaan,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/kochadaiiyaan-review/,,5/5.0,,2.933333333,"Kochadaiiyaan, hailed as 'India's first photo-realistic performance capture film', is a sore disappointment primarily because of the poor quality of animation and VFX. A potentially interesting story and the presence of Superstar Rajnikanth all but go to waste in this brave but failed effort.  ","If you watch Kochadaiiyaan, before and after the actual film, you'll see snippets of how this film was made - how the cast had to wear special suits meant for performance capture, how they had nothing to react to in terms of their environment and surroundings. It reminds you just how tough filmmaking is. It also inspires awe for actors like Superstar Rajnikanth, who are willing to embrace new technology and go the distance in order to narrate a story that they believe in. Unfortunately, these 'making-of' segments are also the only things truly worth watching in Kochadaiiyaan.The culprit, not surprisingly, is the quality of the animation and visual effects. Stilted human figures, lifeless textures on the environment, unrealistic camera movements, and so many more; Kochadaiiyaan is a thorough visual disappointment. Of course, those comparing this film with the likes of a big Hollywood summer blockbuster must know that the entire budget of Kochadaiiyaan would be a fraction of how much it would cost just to get Hugh Jackman for X-Men: Days of Future Past. Still, that doesn't ease the disappointment.A pity, really, because the story, though not truly out of the ordinary, had enough meat in it to make for a fun watch. Two warring kingdoms battling the ghosts of the past and the threats of the future, as one hero straddles the burdens of history, loss, deception and love. It had all the makings of a bit of a minor epic, to be honest. Unfortunately, apart from the visual let-down, the film also suffers from mediocre music by A. R. Rahman, and a rather placid screenplay. The twists never really grab at you, and you always wait for at least a glimpse of Thalaivar - the real one - he who makes you believe in the impossible; but it never happens. He has a flourish or two here and there, and he also gets to rattle a few dialogues (including some self-referencing I suspect, if you watch the film in Tamil) but you always miss him. Fact is, there's just one of him in flesh and blood, and no amount of technology can change that. Of course, there are so many shots in the film which just couldn't have been executed in live-action - Rajnikanth's entry, for instance. Alas!Soundarya Rajnikanth Ashwin must surely be lauded for the brave attempt, but Kochadaiiyaan deserved to either be as good as the best performance-capture animated film ever, or it deserved to have not been made at all. This technically shoddy film that has come out of the attempt does justice to neither Thalaivar nor his fans. And what they've made of gorgeous Deepika Padukone's face added travesty. That is the sad truth of it.

571,669,669,669,669,Krishna,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review,/movie/krishna-review/,,,,2.9,,"Parents can use this movie as a substitute story-teller. The kids might not mind, the adults though are certainly not going to enjoy this show! This is a great story with a whole lot of sub-plots. It is really sad that it has not been explored to its full potential. The movie starts out with titles that look like a PowerPoint presentation.  It looks like it was decided that 50% of screen time will be devoted to the Krishna's birth and Kansa's death, the rest  will be used to fit in as many stories related to Krishna as possible. The pace simply drags as Kansa's end gets closer. The screenplay is patchy and the transition from sub-story to sub-story is not smooth.
The animation is outright bad! Budget constraints cannot be used as an excuse for equal-sized, blunt fingers and sharp, angular shoulders for all characters. Once you see this and the first five minutes of the movie have passed by, you let go of any expectation you might have had of seeing more than three expressions on the faces - sad, happy and angry. Colours too have not been used to their fullest, especially in the background and there is undoubtedly ample scope for colour in this story! One thing that does stand out though, is the ripples on the water surface, they have been done really well. 
It is very clear that this one is directed towards children right from the disclaimer in the beginning. Then why is the music not geared towards them? The songs are so drab that the song used in the credits looks out of place though it is made with kids for kids. The background score is good though, especially the way a chorus breaks into ""Krishna…"" each time Krishna slays a demon. 
The only reason to give this the middle rating is that it is a good way to introduce and narrate the details of Krishna's fables to children. It is certainly worth showing it to the kids once with the hope that they have not established standards for animation just yet.

Less good, more bad. Even the keen, should wait for the DVD release.","Superhero vs. End-of-the-worlder - there are only so many ways this theme can go. Krrish 3 goes exactly that way - predictable down to the last scene and detail. Even so, well-written superhero films have something about the hero's dilemma or the situations he has to go through, to keep you interested. Krrish 3 shows potential with such situations a couple of times, but then they fizzle away. Krrish 3 just fizzles away.Actually, the film is somewhat of a surprise from what you expect. I didn't expect there to be much of a story - expectations set by Krrish. But, even though they aren't remotely logical, a few things that are cute. Just that the thought was put into it when it wasn't expected - reaches out to you. For example, the manner in which our end-of-the-worlder, Kaal (Viveik Oberoi) gets his army together. Also, as laughable as Rohit's (Hrithik Roshan) pet project is, the concept itself is used adorably. On the other hand, I expected the VFX to keep me glued but they turn out to be shoddy for way too many parts. The special effects in the first 20 minutes or so shocked me. The inside of an aircraft's cockpit reminded me of how drives in a car were shot in the 50s! When Krrish (Hrithik Roshan) flies, it's just that the fastening cord that holds Hrithik Roshan has been edited out, else you can pretty much tell it's there. However, there are a few special effects that work too. Despite a thousand and one inspirations Krrish 3's VFX are rather disappointing. There is only so much you can blame on the low budget. At the very least, they shouldn't have attempted the effects and action sequences that they couldn't do well. Mediocrity in this area from an action film of this stature is not acceptable.One of the other main things any action film relies on heavily is dialogue. And Krrish 3 has absolutely nothing going for itself in this department. ""Fusion is the Future,"" really? It's almost as if it were written for reviewers to fill a paragraph with. Then, you have Krrish sending across public service announcements and blatantly advertising way too many brands. Neither of them - be it noble or money-minded - have a place in a film. They instantly, bring you back to the real world, which is very jerky considering the fantasy world Krrish lives in. For a few minutes, I was impressed, even if with a fair share of amusement, with the Krishna vs. Kaal metaphor going on in the film. And then of course, they had to spoon-feed it and make you wonder if the villain was named Kaal just so that, a supposedly cool line could be said by Kaal. Oh well.That besides a child gets an absolutely unacceptable line. Interestingly enough, I didn't mind the performances at all. It could have to do with my mental preparation for an onslaught of hamming. But the 2.5 hours passed by with very few cringes, at least owing to the acting. Hrithik Roshan's transition from Rohit (dad) to Krishna (son) to Krrish (superhero) makes you admire him. It must not be easy to modulate your voice and keep it consistent the way he does for Rohit. Now, if only he didn't flare his nostrils as a sign of anger and/or disappointment and/or fear. Priyanka Chopra has very little to do, but there is this one glimpse and it stays for half a fraction of a second, which makes you wish she had been given more to do in that zone. Viveik Oberoi does do a decent job of instilling fear as the mean villain - for about two minutes. After that you just lament for what the character could have been. I guess you cannot fault the actor for that. But that gives him precious little to do. Kangna Ranaut's character, Kaaya too suffers from the same shortcoming in the writing department. Else, she could've been a really interesting character and Kangna was doing a fair job with it too.But then, if the makers had spent more time on the characters, they wouldn't have had the time to find abrupt places for songs to be inserted now, would they? That besides, the music, lyrics and worst of all the choreography (except for a few steps by Hrithik Roshan) take you straight back to the 90s. Now, where is the need for that?So, given what I liked in the film, would I watch it again? Not a chance! Do I regret watching it once? I don't regret watching any film once (well, almost - exceptions here and here).  Would I mind it if my kids watched it? Not really, only once, though. If you are a Hrithik Roshan fan - Happy Diwali! For the rest of us, don't watch it and have a Happy Diwali any way! :D

An effort by a group of debutantes. And what we have is a good film which talks about obsessed beyond reason, a mania that sees no necessity for reason. Yes, it gets abstract, yet it stays very well within grasp as it points at and makes us think about our own obsessions. ","Do you remember the days from when you were younger, when you went crazy about something or the other? Trading cards, dolls, a cricketer, a film star, a fellow classmate? Through most of Kshay, Chhai's (Rasika Dugal) obsession with Goddess Laxmi made me think of her as that obsessed child. One who would claim, ""you don't understand!"" to anyone who tried to talk him out of that mania which he thought was perfectly valid. And slowly you see a few adults you know in Chhai's eyes. Their obsession might be different money, power or fame - but the similarity is stark. And while you realize it is counter-productive if not shallow, they don't give up. Kshay is a story that symbolizes exactly that.The parallel doesn't stop there. The irony, that to please Goddess Laxmi, the goddess of wealth - even though she's not asking for it - requires money, never leaves you. Also, Kshay's fixation with people who are fixated for only one thing and none else is shown through the black and white palate, like no other color exists for them, like life has no other shades. Though the same cannot be said about its charactes. Chhai, her husband Arvind, their neighbor Shruti - all are varying shades of gray. They are real, they reach out to you, and you worry for them however tiny their role be. The villain is surely stark black, but then again he is representing the concretized brutality of the business world, this once the construction business. Arvind on the other hand is the perfect example of the guy chasing a dream, one who looks so tired from the chasing that he's willing to accept a compromise, were there someone making an offer.Yet, there are some dots in the script that seem like they don't connect and I it is indeed perplexing. But, if you allow yourself to accept Chhai's fanaticism, you realize that in her world the connection makes perfect sense. Or greater still, her world requires no connection. But, even if she is visibly mentally disturbed, she is supposed to resemble us and our own obsession.Therein lies my only but biggish problem with Kshay. It is not because Kshay can disengage you in the first few minutes with its non-standard and thus absurd sounds and overt attempt at being abstract. It is this niggling feeling that I have with most films that fall in this realm, why do they go that extra length to make the audience figure out the point of the film. I'm not saying you should spoon-feed us, but why do you have to go out of your way to make a simple objective look something more intellectual than it ultimately is. Isn't there a gray between the black and white? The good news though is that once I accept that that is the route Kshay has taken, it is an engaging film.  A film that certainly should be lauded as an indie project that saw light after four years of effort by a group of debutantes.

But, I doubt they'd see themselves run silly behind a stranger with a gun.","An educated, bored housewife homemaker is taken for granted. Not a very unfamiliar situation. You feel bad for her. You want her to reach out and do something exciting for herself. Can a day in her life actually make an interesting film, even if it is an unusual one? Not really. Especially when it's done in a mostly, disjointed way.One way to enjoy most films, or at least give them a fair chance, is to give in to the writer's leap of logic. I mean there is no way you can even begin to understand the basic premise of Kucch Luv Jaisaa if you cannot accept that a middle-aged, supposedly-smart woman would strike a conversation with a stranger at a coffee shop and ask to spend a day with him. So, accept we shall. But within the confines of those logical aberrations, there should be some rules, right? The weird just keeps getting weirder. And Kucch Luv Jaisaa is almost as boring as a woman-going-through-mid-life-crisis' life. Some endearing observations - minor and larger, societal, topical ones - and awesome performances by the lead pair that keep it from being a satisfying snooze experience. I have loved Sheffali Chayya Shah, ever since her Banegi Apni Baat days. She has a screen presence that very few character actors can boast of. And she carries that off in Kucch Luv Jaisaa too. Rahul Bose is her glum, introvert and perceptive companion. If only their characters had better motivations or even their motivations had better details, the film would have been enjoyable. Let us assume, the aim of the film is not to engage us in the aims and objectives of their lives. In that case, at least what they observed about each other needed something stronger, anything to involve us that one bit more. And what was with getting issues like ""how to talk to your teenage daughter"" doing in the middle of all this? Or rather in the end of all this? To show the stuck-at-home woman is after all ""cool""?You pick a dull housewife, you pick a gangster. Chalk and cheese spend a day together, we get that. You try to tell us that it's not fun to be either. Maybe they need to find an in-between and that's where they'll find peace and happiness. Yeah, right?

Of course, you still have to figure a way to keep yourself out of it.The tag-line reads - Why should boys have all the fun?

But obviously, the only fun thing to do is to get various types of beauty treatments. Someone here needs a better exposure to girls!!! It’s sad to realize that these actresses agreed to portray their gender in such light. The story starts at a good pace with three friends  (Rekha, Vasundhara Das, Kim Sharma) wanting to find the fourth one (Mahima Choudhary) a groom. It finishes with trying to make you feel sorry for Rekha’s selfish character and her four failed marriages. The second half is like you are in a car driving uphill in fourth gear. How it travels from the first to the second is something you can live without watching. I am not sure whether the gorgeous Rekha “needs” to do this or not. What I am certain of though, is that she “should” not do such movies. We should thank the director for letting her be on her own for most of the second half where she plays the darker shades of her character. But it was too little and too late. Also, he took it too far and let her do it for too long, making it boring. Though I have my reservations about the use of ‘din dhal jaaye’ (the classic from Guide) for that particular scene, Rekha has sung it beautifully. Yes, you read that right, the lady can sing! And as always can seduce. That too, being fully-clad – full-sleeve blouse, sari, et al. Compared to the other barely-clad women who could hardly deliver a dialogue, let alone successfully seduce.  The technical values were off too – dubbing, music, make-up, cinematography (half the movie looked like it was shot out of focus), and dialogues (five half-funny lines don’t count). First half – loud, second half – sermonizing, whole movie - pointless: doesn’t quite work for an audience that wants to be entertained. Oh, by the way, you also have to make sure that the friend we were talking about does not read this review.

Been there, seen that. But Kuku Mathur Ki Jhand Lag Gayi tries its hand at being different. It goes about the ""coming-of-age"" bit in a non-conventional, non-likeable way even. It adds a little zany to it. But, unfortunately in the end, it plummets into the worst kind of run-of-the-mill.Kuku's cousin Prabhakar helps clueless Kuku in a very Bawarchi kind of a way. He just happens to be around to help anyone who needs help in Kuku's family. His means might not be the most honest ones, but get the Mathur family members what they want, they do. Kuku Mathur Ki Jhand Lag Gayi has its share of annoying, loud characters. Their existence seem to be to make the film feature length from a short. The satirical bits of the writing induce some humor. But, they are stretched so long that you wonder if the writers were only being satirical or they really believed in the hocus-pocus shown. The borderline between spoof and using spoof as a medium to show exactly the same thing that you are spoofing. Interestingly, this humbug is where the craziness of the film begins. I am all for quirk in films, but this one gets too literal instead of staying subtle and it comes a bit too late in the film too. Then you are left with the performances. Siddharth Gupta and Amit Sial are the only ones you'd remember after you walk out of the theater. And maybe Pallavi Batra for the loud character she plays annoyingly and aptly. None of this enough to make Kuku Mathur Ki Jhand Lag Gayi a watchable film. And what's with the seemingly profanity in the title? Or maybe I don't want to know.

We are well versed with the characters, Po the endearingly overweight Panda, the Furious Five - Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan) Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross), their inter-personal relationships and how the uncanny situation of a Panda being the Dragon Warrior came about to be. While the first movie was about Po’s training and redemption, this time around Po’s nemesis Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) is sly and sinister, as opposed to the magnanimously dangerous Tai Lung of the first movie. We see Po venture into his past, to seek his identity while trying to destroy the enemy of the country.Po’s victory becomes sweeter for the audience because it’s that much more satisfying to beat a creepy villain. We know how it's going to end, but Po's clumsy idiosyncrasies pull you through a laughter-ridden hour and a half, as Po proves himself to be an entertaining yet worthy Dragon Warrior.A must-mention is the intricate 3D animation – even as a layman you can tell the details are remarkable and as imaginative as it gets. The expressions and voiceovers blend almost perfectly while absorbing you into their world of honour, colour and humour.Although the sequel allows Po to be a savior, and a convincing one at that – this time around his goofy instances are cut short and much time is devoted to funny dialogues. He’s still the same old Dumpling-loving, bouncy Panda. What I love is that the success has not gotten to his head, but the sense of him being an underdog has considerably reduced. This makes the plot slightly predictable, as Po has the same eureka moments as the first installment; the humour is on the same level with just a shift in the story. However, the ultimate moral self-belief and hidden power manifests into 90 minutes well spent. It’s undoubtedly charming and funny, just not funnier and more charming than the first movie. You could watch both movies back to back and think of it as one long film. That stands as a victory for Kung Fu Panda 2, in a world where sequels and 3D movies are clouding pretty much every aspect of a film. If you are confused about whether to go watch the film, don’t be. You will have fun; you will remember why you loved Kung Fu Panda and you will find the idea of a sequel seems exciting.  Even so, Baby Po is so adorably animated in Po’s flashback, you’ll want to freeze the frame and just cuddle him to sleep. Baby Po is adorable, bouncy, funny and his eyes speak of an upcoming legend. Much like the film.

578,676,676,676,676,Kurbaan,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma reviewNotepad50 Critic Reviews 2.8/5.0 9 Reader Reviews 2/5.0,/movie/kurbaan-review/,2.8/5.0,2/5.0,,2.366666667,"All but a couple Muslim's are terrorists. Is that what we need to hear in this day & age? Predictable to the minutest detail and utterly-butterly s..l..o..w. You sure have better ways to induce yawns now, don't you?","""All Muslim's are terrorists."" In order to prove that the Western world thinks that way, Rensil D'Souza and Karan Johar go that extra mile to showcase the very same thing. And, hopefully inadvertently, complete the circle and cast the despicable stereotype in a deeper mould. Why are good Islamic citizens left out? Ok, I'm taking the same route and exaggerating a bit here. But only a bit. A couple of Muslim characters in Kurbaan are not fundamentalists and are not blind followers of their religion. But just 2-3 between 12-13 main characters can see that their faith is being misused. That's a gross overstatement of the human race's irrationality. And even if I'm naïve that that's how things are. How does decorating that fact with a star couple help? Saif Ali Khan plays Ehsaan and is rather stiff. Somehow, he doesn't seem at ease with the character. Except for a few scenes with Kareena Kapoor (Avantika, the girl next door). And those scenes are really well-done. Kareena looks the prettiest without make-up on and is by-far the most huggable sight when her character is supposed to cry. This woman can act. It's a pity only a few directors find her potential size-exponential worth exploring too. The rest of the cast except for Vivek Oberoi are just doing their drill. No record-breaking performances asked for, none given. Physical intimacy is not something Indian filmmakers are very good at. But, here there's nothing crude and both actors fit just right. Now, whether the scene was a ""script ki maang"" (need of the script) or not is very debatable. And clearly, this much-talked about scene is as predictable and lame as ever. The pre-release attention that the scene has been intentionally awarded with makes the timing even more obvious. That still doesn't take away from the fact that it is worth every marketing penny spent on the skin-show. Delicious! And these things are major let-downs after the slick title sequence. It's so refreshing, especially when you are expecting a Dharma Productions product to bank on a crisp, fresh view of the New York skyline. Thankfully, the smart production values continue after that. The background score and actually, the lack of it for almost two-thirds of the film is not only worth a round of applause but it also tried its best to keep you focused on the acting and reacting. Some great work by the Foley artist. Similarly, the framing of individual shots are very engaging. They are different and try their best to build the curiosity.  But, neither sound nor visuals can take the place of the story and more importantly of the details that make the story. They all take the beaten path. The community that the terrorists belong to feel marginalized and the only way to deal with that is to shoot on sight - even people belonging to their own community, it is martyrdom after all. Every time someone on screen said that, I felt my skin crawl. I'm sure the line, like many other done-to-death dialogues, was a really strong statement when it was used the first time. But, now you know that argument and want to hear the real people talking. Especially because the makers are very clear about making this a serious, dark film. How in such a case can a small terrorist group act in a void, by themselves, with no apparent help from outside? And it's not like we are following one or the other character's story. It's all plain and stagnant. They want to kill, kill, kill and they kill, kill, kill. Over 5 hours after the film and I still can't figure out what the purpose of the film is. 
To entertain? It got way too many unintentional laughs, right down to the convenient glass of milk showing up as expected. 
To tell a story? Whose? 
Avantika's? I know nothing about her except that she's a professor in psychology with no apparent insight into human nature. Though her struggle to be in love and the resultant helplessness is obvious. 
Ehsaan's? Maybe. But how much do we really know about him? He is in dilemma. Sure, but what about it? I don't empathize with him, I don't hate him, because I haven't a clue why he does what he does.  
The story of a terror attack? Which one? The one in the planning of which I wasn't allowed to participate? The games and counter-games seem to be serving no particular end.I don't like the tone of such films that almost feel like they take pleasure in reinforcing the stereotype. Where's the balance? Where's the grey? Where's the human face of cold-blooded murder? It does have one, or doesn't it? Are our film-makers claiming that there are absolutely no non-Muslims involved in these acts of terror?

Give it a go for a rare, decent war film.","Hindi war films are a rarity. Well-made ones even more so. Kya Dilli Kya Lahore is a welcome change just for that. To top it off it is a more-or-less two man act and yet, manages to engage you through the 100-minute run-time.Both sides of a dusty, rugged section of the India-Pakistan border find themselves with one soldier each. Interestingly, both the soldiers belonged to the other side before partition. It is easy to understand why their allegiance is confused. You empathize that they are put in such a situation at all. You, in fact, find yourself changing sides for both seem like protagonists and you could take either side as the film moves from one mini-event to another. Kya Dilli Kya Lahore doesn't move much. Not only in its physical space or the time (it is set over a period of about 24 hours), but also in terms of what actually happens in the film. The movement is in emotions rather than events. This gives the film fluidity which feels so different from the episodic nature of many a Hindi film. Given these circumstances, the film does run the risk of becoming repetitive. After all, there are only so many ways in which an Indian and a Pakistani (even if they are newly so) can sling mud at each other. Unfortunately, Kya Dilli Kya Lahore does fall prey to that. But, the pace is such that it gets itself out soon enough.Also, characters go through a back and forth in emotions which is believable but could have very easily gotten iterative, but for the brilliant performances by Vijay Raaz and Manu Rishi. From the word go their act seems so effortless and natural that you take it for granted. I caught myself thinking of it as a performance only when I deliberately focused on it. Till then and immediately after it was a given. Kya Dilli Kya Lahore is not only well-shot, but is also almost background score less - which again is a rarity in Hindi cinema. With only frog croaks and the sound of the wind in the background at many times, when the songs blare (most likely to break monotony) it is jarring. Other than that, the film brings about the vanity of war and the impact of macro level decisions made by politicians on the common man soldier just about well - with a tinge of dark comedy too. It could be called cliché too, but every once in a while cliché works. The last Hindi war film we saw was, War Chhod Na Yaar and it was well, not too good. Kya Dilli Kya Lahore is not only well-intentioned it is well made too. Certainly worth the 100 minutes.

All this is what I expected. But Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum isn't even any of that. The indifference with which I could watch the entire film was pretty saddening. I didn't even feel like disliking the film, like it didn't even deserve that kind of response. Sure, there was lots of loud cackle in the theater. Yet, it wasn't as much as I thought there would be. There were a lot of slack times when there was no puerile pun, no supposedly adult joke, no mockery of gay people. They were just drab spans of few minutes each when you could sense the boredom in the theater, assisted ever-so-slightly with a loud remark, ""stop boring us."" However, when there was laughter, it was so hard that I, for a second, wished that I could enjoy the 'non-veg' jokes the way some of the people in the audience were. It is a release to have such a hearty laugh. But all I could think was, really, THAT was funny?But, this was soon overcome by feeling bad for the lead male actors. Riteish Deshmukh and Tusshar Kapoor try hard, you can see the amount of energy such a performance needs, yet all you can feel is sad for them. They've had to regress mentally by a good 20 years. You can imagine how sorry I felt when I saw  Anupam Kher address dogs as humans and sulk when he sees them mate. Yes, there is a lot of dog-mating talk in the film.The women, have to sit pretty and look gorgeous and they do that all well. And well, of course, dance. The songs are peppy and energetic but the lyrics felt like they were trying too hard to make sense. What I found the most hilarious was they actually tried to have a plot to string all of this together. Along with being mockery telemarketing, Rohit Shetty brand of films, and almost everything else that can be considered intelligent, Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum ends up being a mockery of story writing itself. Like always, I find myself trying too hard to make sense of films that weren't intended to be taken that seriously. But then again, I am a part of that audience.

And yet, the entire set-up kind-a, sort-a works.","Usually when a film mixes genres and/or issues, it gets annoying because it doesn't manage to do justice to any one of them and spreads itself thin. Rock On 2 however, manages to subtly touch upon many a point relevant to the world we live in today. Now, if only its writing didn't rely so heavily on coincidences and a generally sloppy plot. Rock On 2 shows glimpses of both urban and rural dystopia. One corrupted by consumerism among other things and the other by corruption itself. The disconnect between the two worlds can be felt when Adi (Farhan Akhtar) visits Mumbai after a long hiatus from the city. He seems to immediately long for the world he got out of, even if he left it when it was in dire straits. The universal societal issue of generation gap is touched upon too, even if it has a rather unsatisfying climax.  And of course, there is friendship and the strains that a true friendship can wade through.As you'd imagine there is no respite from seriousness, as hard as KD (Purab Kohli) might try. Rock On 2 has a very intense air about it. So glum are three out of the four leads through the film, that you barely get a smile out of them - other than maybe in a flashback, which makes it sorrier because now, you too wish their past returned unbroken.The transitions from one thread to the other are seamless. Thus it doesn't feel like the writers have taken on a lot and aren't able to be fair to any one sub-plot. This doesn't make the use of voiceover from start to finish or the ridiculous coincidences any easier to digest. Also, despite the seamless switches, the film has uneven writing. For example, the parts that sew the first part to this sequel are written well. For a change, a sequel feels like a sequel – characters have aged and grown up and yet they give you a sense of “nothing has changed”. On the other hand there are those jerks in story-writing that the smooth screenplay covers up for. Efficient direction tries to mask some of these shortcomings, but in that attempt, the film becomes a little too long.  Individual scenes/sequences linger on a little longer than needed thus reducing the effect and increasing the length. This also makes the film seem like it wants to say something, make a point, in every minute of the film, instead of just telling a story. For a film that relies heavily on music, the music is well below average. The songs of course, appear more or less randomly, the music they are set to doesn't have a punch or repeat value. The lyrics of “woh jahaan” are worth looking up again, but the rest of the songs seem to have taken the beaten path. The grand climax starts of well, but loses steam till Magik takes stage. Interestingly, the finale does make you feel like you are at the rock show but it is not shot half as well as “jaago”. Also, it is ironical that Farhan Akhtar's voice as a singer was heard so often during the film, despite it being so flat. Shouldn't a better singer have gotten a chance for playback? His character, Adi is right though, their band, Magik does need a new lead singer. The actors all do well even if they are at the borderline of looking like they are trying a little too hard to be casual, serious, anxious, morose and so on. But it can pass. Even Arjun Rampal does his bit convincingly. It is nice to see Shashank Arora on this stage even if he's playing a character who seems to be lost – it gets a tad repetitive but will do till his next film. Shraddha Kapoor has a lovely voice and I wish we had heard more of her in the film. In the acting department, not a lot is demanded from her and she takes that load well.In fact, there's this one scene that has little to do with her but it tugs at your heart. The events around her shock you and you see it reflected in her reactions. There is this other scene with Arjun Rampal reacting in a similar way and you sense a lump in your throat. Who would have thought he could have that effect on you. There are a few, little surprises of this kind in the film. Also, it feels so good to see so many North-Eastern actors (even if some of them are non-actors) in a mainstream film. If only, Rock On 2 had better music and a little more effort in the parts of the puzzle that bring the film together.

","The could'ves, would'ves, should'ves of life. Should I have taken up that interesting but lower-paying job instead of this higher paying, soul-sucking one? Could I have done something more to avoid that breakup? Would any of it have mattered? La La Land aims to approach these questions but brings them up a little too late in the film. Till then, it has other things on agenda - a lot of other things - that all distract from each other. The all-encompassing theme is retro. All along, La La Land wants to doff its hat to Hollywood from decades ago, to romance from those times. It never lets you forget what it wants to pay a tribute to – if talk about the dying interest in jazz doesn't pass the message, it reminds you through costumes and so on. This is along with the omnipresent 50s-style texture that the film carries.Of course, La La Land continues this homage with the romantic story that has touches of  a musical – especially since the latter is becoming such a rarity. However, here it doesn't go all out. The music drops in the background as the film progresses into its second hour. The story itself broadly follows the path of any romantic relationship's arc – the initial excitement, the spring in the step, the bright and sunny days, next comes the fall with a drop into a cold wintery night. Whether it stays there or not is immaterial given there are only one of those two outcomes possible. I have lost hope in finding  any surprises in love stories. My issue is with the  broad stroke. While I don't want to live with the couple through each defining moment of their relationship, I wanted more insight about their motivations, a deeper look.It is strange that I know what the making or breaking points were in the relationship. But, there is a gap of how exactly they got there, that left me unconvinced. That La La Land is also about the clichéd yet constant see-saw at play between “following your dream” and “being practical” takes away from the romance that a musical brings. It doesn't help that there isn't much power in the dialogue. Except for the once when it goes meta about not worrying about what people think when it comes to following one's passion - the writer/director's passion for the era gone-by is in plain sight, after all.While the lack of detail in the story is a big shortcoming, a lot of it is compensated by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Not just their presence, but because of who they make you believe they are. From the first time Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) talks about jazz, you know he could do anything for jazz. And then you see him fall in love and change the definition of his passion. Emma Stone takes your breath away every time her character, Mia auditions for a bit role, especially the first time around. Emma makes you believe Mia is giving it everything she has even though she is frustrated. These two aren't the best pair in the film though. The other couple - the camerawork and editing – give the film a huge lift too. The camera, with its long, long shots, moves as lyrically as the songs. The smooth, rhythmic cuts dance in sync with the tune. 
All put together, the look and feel of the 50s is undeniable. However, I don't see why I should see a film that wants to remind me of films from the 50s, when I could as easily see the films from the 50s! Then instead of an out-of-context, old-school romance set in current times, I would get a proper story set in the right context and time.

588,686,686,686,686,Ladies VS Ricky Bahl,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewNotepadPreview38 Critic Reviews 2.4/5.0 5 Reader Reviews 5/5.0 171 Tweet Reviews 3.4/5.0,/movie/ladies-vs-ricky-bahl-review/,2.4/5.0,5/5.0,3.4/5.0,3.6,"Wow! Is the film fraternity celebrating woman's month or something? While Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl is no where close to bringing all things feminine to screen as The Dirty Picture was, Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl does attempt at portraying various shades of women without stereotyping or caricaturing them. Yet, though the film is interesting it is not entertaining enough.","""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."" But a woman is a woman after all. These are the two lines you are most likely to read in every other review of Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl. A woman is warm and compassionate but you wrong her, and she is capable of making your life hell. But, she will turn back to her warm and compassionate self at the slightest chance. While this is an over-generalization of course and Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl is guilty as charged, I was slightly charmed by the three women representing the three facets of a today's woman - strength in a man's world; old-school simplicity; superficial & so? - and there is a fourth woman who combines the three. Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl started making its way into my good books because the writer spent time in thinking about his women.  But, there is no spark. And no, spark doesn't mean adding absolutely irrelevant songs that bump you out of the stories. The strategy might have worked for Yash Raj Films earlier. But then the music was worth listening to and the choreography and colors were worth being shaken in and out of your film.It's a shame that throughout the first half, I was wondering if a few better known faces for the three women - Dimple, Raina and Saira - would have engaged better. I was thinking about non-top actresses who could've added spunk to the three women's decent performances. They all acted well, but there was something very plain about how their stories came across. It kept bothering me that the stories were interesting, the actors were apt and yet they weren't able to engage me. The mostly basic dialogue is to blame. Except for the lines given to Parineeti Chopra, which were funny and completely in-character, the others were pretty much functional. Parineeti Chopra adds value to it by her comic timing. Also, extra credit to Aditi Sharma and Dipannita Sharma for having done well with the dialogue that they had. There is a lot going on in body language and emotive eyes to convey what was not written. And yet, I can't shake off the feeling that maybe supporting actors from say Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na  or Wake Up! Sid would have added the spirit that is missing. Interestingly, both Ranveer Singh and Anoushka Sharma do nothing new, except maybe show their calendar-photo bodies off. I guess, no one will complain, because nothing major was really being expected from them. Of course, they are two major characters in the film and all that, but you don't come out with a feeling of them being special for the film. In fact, if I hear the twosome utter the word "" partner"" once more, I might mark that against the film, for lack of originality. However, there are a few ""different"" thoughts in the film. I don't use the word ""original"" because I'm sure someone somewhere has done it before. But, there are these sly comments on commercialism and hypocrisy that are brought about in a very casually - a comment about how we don't our Rs.30 wine from our Rs.30,000 wine but are willing to gulp it down, if its packaged in a 5-star environment.  Unfortunately, along with this is the usual problem that goes with any ""con"" film. Everything works out too easily and the climax is usually a cop-out. Add to that predictability, having to ask whether you were just conned into thinking this was a woman's film?

Deepika Padukone and Neil Nitin Mukesh showcase all the masala, and yet it doesn't become too much for the palate to take. A film jis mein emotion bhi hai d-rrrama bhi hai t-rrragedy bhi hai (a popular dialogue from Sholay which translates to has emotion, drama, tragedy) and comedy and action too - and all in good portions. ","Sincere aplogies. To the writer, director, and actors for being so apprehensive about Lafangey Parindey. I made some promo-based assumptions that were completely off. And boy, am I glad!! It can be argued that I liked the film because my theories were thrown out of the window. What's done is done. I came out of the theater shaking my head in disapproval at the climax but with a generally happy feeling. And that's how the score stands. Lafangey Parindey is of course, a to-the-core love story. And there is absolutely nothing extraordinary about the one-line plot anyone would use to describe it. The climax is a forgone conclusion. Also like any of the basic seven stories that exist in the world, it’s how the characters get where they are, their ups and downs that matter. Lafangey Parindey engaged and made me care for the protagonists. In fact, even a couple of side characters (Nina and Faizal) got me interested. Lafangey Parindey is a fairytale with the appropriate dose of villains, witches and simplified-real-life in their own little world. The main characters have shades of grey, which make them a little more interesting than your commonplace Jack and Jill. The villain is not all out bad but he doesn't go all-out soft either. Each of the characters get what I call, ""presence of mind"" dialogues - natural, use everyday language, have common-man wit in lieu of filmy-wit. Like some sudden but expected character-transitions are masked under a smart line or two - like a mom who doesn't believe in her daughter's aspirations suddenly calls her daughter phataakaa when she's successful. Some of the details in the writing give a nice touch to the second layer of the film. With an overt statement that each character has a person to look up to who they aspire to be like, there is a covert line pointing to the fact that none of the ""role models"" remain the person they used to be. It's disheartening then that the climax is a major let-down. The signs do start showing post-interval, but the nosedive into blah in the last 15-minutes came as a shocker. Or was it their way of catching us off-guard :)? What was with the sudden rush to wrap it up? Anyway, the characters engage you and that's where the film connects with you. Our hero, Nandu is played by Neil Nitin Mukesh, who could easily have passed off for a 'chocolate boy.' But, the writers recognize that this grown-up audience now needs their filmi heroes to be more than that. So, this once, the Mumbai milieu is chosen to add to Nandu's character and make him more palatable (too-sweet leads to diabetics after). And it sort-of, kind-of works. Neil has a range of expressions, which he does really well - confusion, awe, guilt, when he's keeping a secret, and a few more. Outside of this though, his face is frozen. His body doesn't move much anyways. Also, this range fits in Nandu's character - he's a hunk from the slums, who uses his muscle for an adrenaline rush and makes some money off that too. He hasn't given his future a thought, but can go from being a boxing fighter to a bar bouncer to what his girlfriend wants him to be, apparently very swiftly. Don't get me wrong, this is not entirely illogical, or out-of -the-blue. It is gradual, and an attempt is made to indicate motivation, albeit not entirely convincing. Under the 'not entirely convincing' headline will also be a 'Deepika Padukone in the tapori-world. Like I mentioned in the preview, the tight backbone, the long mane, the stance in general give away that she's not really a girl who lives a lousy life. But she makes up for, or let's make that - tries to make up for that with her attitude. Her character is a strong girl who won't take 'no' for an answer even from the Almighty. Yep! A proper mainstream movie made by an ad-film maker for a leading production house has a beefy role for the lead-lady. She has her entire range of ups and downs too. I wouldn't have imagined Deepika-Neil as a pair. Somehow, together they look like what aunties at weddings might choose to say about the marrying couple, ""He doesn't suit her"" or vice versa. But, mainly because of Deepika's performance, they seem connected and you want them to be with each other and live happily ever after. The side characters are a mix. You have Kay Kay Menon entering and exiting his role as if he owns the place - the hero's self-appointed caretaker (His make-up is also awesome.) And you have the unbelievable heroine's brother with no soul and mind. Also, the second half unnecessarily shows a couple of caricatured characters. The frames and the way they are edited make Lafangey Parindey look really slick. The music is contemporary and likable. The songs are choreographed with soul and are not the regular 1-2-3 jerks. The action, especially the bike-thrills spell - DO NOT TRY AT HOME. And the story in general is also, ""NOT TRIED AT HOME"" because the real world doesn't work this way. But along with the laugh-out-loud moments there is a warm, very human story inside. So, then just like it might be considered non-conforming to dislike the   new wave cinema  will it be considered out-of-fashion to like Lafangey Parindey for what it is? Ps. is it a criminal offence to have a hero wearing sunglasses that are not RayBan? #JustAsking

Finally, we have been treated like people with thinking capacity and have not been taken for granted as an audience. Thank you Mr. Rajkumar Hirani for entertaining us wonderfully!!! 
This movie is about non-violence and is, as contradictory as it may sound, very contemporary. It is about using Gandhian principles to deal with the common man’s current day-to-day problems. And here is the beauty of the script, it is not preachy! Smiles, laughter, misty eyes, tears are abundant on both sides of the screen. 
Munnabhai and Circuit are adorable, articulately sketched out characters. The characterization is maintained in the songs too – from the music and lyrics right to the simple and sweet choreography. Not only do Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi play out their characters as if they are living them, it also felt like they enjoyed every bit of their roles. You sense their energy. The chemistry between them is exceptional, especially in scenes with just the two of them – both at dhobi ghat and outside. Vidya Balan’s smile brings freshness to the screen, especially while paying tribute to Robin Williams (Good Morning, Vietnam). Boman Irani playing a bitter-sweet character has his comic timing as right as ever. Dilip Prabhawalkar’s voice modulation is spot on and kudos to the make-up person too. Familiar faces from Munnabhai MBBS bring warm memories from the first movie in the Munnabhai series.  
The songs, for a change, add value to the script since the lyrics of almost all songs are very situational. However, that means that they may not make sense when you are only listening to them. The story and script skillfully avoided certain things. For instance, the generation gap problem was not over used, the psychiatry element was not left unexplained, and the love angle did not go through misunderstanding after misunderstanding. It is also refreshing to see that there is no unnecessary show of snow in Switzerland using a dream sequence as an excuse.  
This is a product of excellent teamwork. The director could not have done it without the actors who in turn could not have done it without the dialogues and lyrics, and of course the dialogues would be worthless if it were not for the story and the script, which in the first place could have been ruined through improper execution by the director.  
Of course, nothing in life is perfect, right? … there are a few lapses but they are worth ignoring. There is a little extra melodrama, a few extra tears, a couple improbable coincidences, an overestimated use of World Space, and a few unnecessary dialogues considering the audience is being treated with respect. Also, the dancers on the side could have done with a few expressions.  
This is no doubt a feel good movie, but it has that something extra which you begin experiencing once the credits start rolling and the ‘EXIT’ lights turn on. The issues raised will stay with you after you leave the hall (unless of course you are a skeptic). All-in-all a must watch for one and all!

Of course, we need truce but not sure if we need a movie on the issue with the backdrop of a sport that seems to mean more war than anything else.","Most of the sports-themed films I've seen have been based on a sport that I've enjoyed watching, at least a bit. I always wondered how differently the film would appeal to a person who is not interested in the sport, or doesn't know the rules. Today, I was a part of that audience. It is difficult to say if I didn't enjoy the film because I don't like the sport one bit or it was a not-so well made film. My problem with boxing - any kind - is not only that it is a brutal game but also it seemed like the wrong one to pick for a theme of peace. I know, it can be argued that the irony was the whole point of the film. But, that didn't go down well with me, at all. I can imagine why the film was banned in Pakistan. I'm sure we'd have a furor here if we as a country were shown as evil, manipulative and cheaters. And to top it off, if that same film had all Pakistanis doing the right thing at the right time. Also, how much sense does it make to show individuals from each country hating the other while the government is using its machinery to end the war. Maybe it's closer to truth. Scary but I still don't see how this helps the process of peace. The film in itself has a very standard story. You win some, you lose some. You drive home a point. I actually liked the way in which the conflict was resolved, as a concept. But, the way in which it was done, the bulk character transformations just were too much to gulp down. As a far-fetched possibility, the character conversions would have worked had the actors done a half-way decent job with their acting. Interestingly, Aanahad was good with the growling during his boxing games as compared to the stone-face and body he carried even when he was supposedly being playful. Some of the most awful dialogue delivery possible. And what can be done when the only inspiration around seems to be Nafisa Ali. Sushant Singh, Farookh Shaikh and Saurabh Shukla are good in their support roles but can't make up for the expressionless cast around. So, the theme didn't appeal to me, the performances had nothing to hold my interest. The only thing that worked for me was the camerawork. It really accentuated the well-choreographed action sequences. How true they were to the game, I wouldn't be able to tell.A slow narrative of how a family hurt by a person from another country deals with the situation. It uses the usual means, no new moves. And I don't see why that should engage, educate, entertain?

Important stories to know, strike a chord. A must watch, even if you don't want to make a trip to the theater. ","Lakshmi's synopsis on Bookmyshow reads -Lakshmi, a 13 year old girl is kidnapped and sold into prostitution. Thrown into this horrific, inhuman world where she is raped and brutally beaten she struggles to survive with the help of the other girls and her own will to never give in.It makes Lakshmi, the film, sound like a run-of-the-mill struggle to victory story, which it very well might be. The film though sensitizes you to horrific human trafficking and how helpless the situation is. At the same time, you do realise that real-life must be only worse. The bravery of one girl, Lakshmi sounds unreal and that is what sets the film apart - it is based on true life. Lakshmi's bravery is real.The narrative feels so real that many a time, it feels like a documentary. Yet, it is difficult to judge if this would have come through if it were not for the brilliant performances - from Monali Thakur, to Shifaali Shah to Satish Kaushik to Nagesh Kukunoor himself. You feel hatred towards the pimp, Chinna played by Nagesh Kukunoor as strongly as you feel Lakshmi and Jyothi's pain through Monali Thakur and and Shifaali Shah respectively. Equal weightage has to be given the unavoidable crass language. It's not just the curse words but the brazen lines with which prostitution and related issues are portrayed that hits you but not in a wannabe way. It is perfectly in tune with the subject in hand.When it comes down to stories based on real life with soulful narration, there is very little to say other than, ""go watch it, because you need to."" Of course, Lakshmi is a very difficult and intense watch - for women, for sure, and hopefully for men too.

It's done in a rush and tries too hard to sell itself to the audience who is presumed to like loud background music and unnecessary drama. Overall, it loses out because it's neither subtle nor loud enough to be a crowd pleaser.","After watching 2 brilliant films back-to-back,Tere Bin Laden and Udaan, I was all set for a hatrick. But Sanjay Dutt's slo-mo entry with loud background music showed my expectations their place. But my heart still hung on to the hope that Rahul Dholakia will surely make a strong commentary. And commentary it was. Lamhaa is a revision of Kashmir's saga from 1989 and a running description of how nothing has changed since then. It’s not boring but doesn't get you involved except for the last reel or so, where the atrocities of the jihaadis are very effectively slapped on your face. It is arguably an insurmountable task for a film to address the nexus of one fascist faction, another faction, Indian government, Pakistani Government, idealists, military, and the common man - each of them with their aspirations, filled with back-stabbers and double-crossers. I'd assume it is only understandable for the film to rush through this all without much attention to details - characterization, plot and pace. But this is accompanied with a notion of typical, shrill music in the background and dramatization techniques  that should be reserved for infant-amateurs. And that is like drawing one more straw, if not the last one. The last one would be the predictable dialogues. It was disheartening to see actor after actor repeat the same thing in the same words over and over again - ""No one cares about Kashmir and her real issues, everyone has their own agenda masked by some altruism."" What starts out as a history lesson, ends up in an attempt to brainwash us with repetitive mention of the current state of affairs. Within this, the name 'Strong' and its derivatives are used so many times that you get desensitized to the beauty and the terror of those 2 syllables. (Geeky joke warning: Someone seems to have briefed the writer that google ranks videos according to number of times a word is repeated in its content!) So in line with dialogues that exist as filler, as if a silent frame is penalized, there is a choppy screenplay. The performances aren't out of the ordinary, nor are they extraordinarily bad. Anupam Kher, of course, comes out really well as the inspirational leader. Kunal Kapoor is more or less flat as the principled leader of the masses. Bipasha's emotional outbursts are very involving. But she neither brings glamor quotient nor does she fit into the role of someone who has grown up in a conservative environment. She's too straight and her gait too city-girl like to be entirely convincing. You could've taken all of this in your stride if the story that evolves in the second half came a little earlier. In the attempt to start macro and narrow it slowly down to one event, the writers lost track of time. From characters that represent entities the plot gravitates towards individual A&Os. This focus on people that belong to a group is very intriguing, but it's too little, too late. It is remarkable that the vanity of an issue with global repercussions comes across, despite all the flaws. By the end, your heart goes out to the Kashmiris and you are touched. And that, is Lamhaa's true success.

A lackluster narrative, despite the over-dramatization, which Manoj Bajpayee somehow tries to hold together with his performance.","A film less than two hours and yet you get bored - that tells you whether or not you should watch the film. But, here go the details, anyway. Bored with the story because it just won't move. Whatever needs to be said about the characters is said in the first 25-30 minutes and that too in slow motion. After that, it's just a wait for the inevitable to happen. Sure, there could have been some interest generated by how it transpires, but not here. There are a few twists leading up to the predictable climax, but what good are twists if you can catch up with them between power naps. No, I didn't sleep, but it'd have been so easy to. Bored with the mostly uni-dimensional characters and the monotonous performances. Jaswant Sisodiya (Manoj Bajpayee) is a egomaniacal political hoodlum you'd love to hate. Manoj Bajpayee does invoke disgust towards Jaswant but you get used to that revulsion towards him soon enough. He also thinks of his obsession for Anju as his love for her. Anju (Tia Bajpai) is the damsel in distress and pretty much stays so. There is no attempt whatsoever to show her pathos except for the one mandatory scrubbing-her-rape-off shower scene. Other than that, it is her silence and voiceover that we have to interpret as sadness. And who knows, maybe you do go dead in face and voice if you've been sexually exploited the way she has been. The third angle in the triangle is that of character-who-is-not-named Arjan Bajwa who enjoys the most layered character of them all and this is not saying much. His demonic anger gets to struggle between gratitude towards Jaswant aka bhai-sahaband empathy for Anju, which in turn makes him, rediscover his human-side. Even though it can be argued that the characters sound interesting, the problem is that what I have said in these two paragraphs is all that there is to them. Add to that the dramatization due to an OD of slow-motion and loud background music.What's a story about women being exploited in the little towns of India without showing too much of the one woman it's talking about let alone a glimpse of other such women? If you haven't evoked an emotion for the protagonist, how can you make me feel anything for the issue?

They have chemistry, but it’s mostly in the moment. The film doesn’t have a USP, nothing new or fresh and is easily forgettable. It’s like everybody behind the film desperately tried every trick in the book to make a marketable, summer rom-com but forgot the main ingredient - relatability. ","Gone are the days when romantic comedies meant falling in love with a person who is the stark opposite of your personality – memorizing their dialogues, their looks and just living their lives with them. Before we knew it, When Harry Met Sally, Serendipity and Notting Hill is now No Strings Attached, What Happens in Vegas and the likes. Somewhere you wondered where the romance of everyday people in magical circumstances got replaced with quirky sex comedies where “love” became a dangerous drug you happen to sniff by the end of the film. The promos of Larry Crowne brought back the nostalgic feeling of the rom-coms of the 90s with a contemporary lime-twist. Tom Hanks is Larry Crowne, a popular middle-aged man working at U-mart and Julia Roberts is a teacher who’s lost her passion for the profession. Crowne gets fired from his job because of his lack of college education and he meets his teacher, Mrs. Tainot, at the public-speaking class she takes.They’re immediately cast as opposites. He’s charming, cute in a middle-aged way and she’s uptight and cynical – just like the good old days where one character made up for the lack of qualities in another. Predictably so, they take their time to warm up to each other. But once that’s through, the background score, the dialogues everything gets lighter, the lead pair seems pleasant with the make-me-feel-alive kind of chemistry. Oh yes, Hanks and Roberts have chemistry, which is a breeze to see. But there’s nothing beyond the chemistry. It’s like the whole film circles around that once aspect, branching out every now and then to throw in some sub-plot. It’s not a memorable film, the kind you wouldn’t mind watching on TV while switching channels. It’s an old-fashioned, character-driven love story, and even talks about contemporary issues like the economic crunch in the US, but you could walk out of the theatre feeling unaffected and forgetting why you went in, in the first place. More importantly, both lead characters seem to strike a friendship more than a fairytale romance. They seem like the kind who would have great conversations over coffee and a fireplace. The palpable chemistry is attributed to the well-written characters and good acting on Hanks and Roberts part, but a romance was unnecessary and just seemed forced. Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts are a marketable pair; it would have been a far more interesting film if it broke the stereotype of the compulsive need to make a lead pair fall in love. Otherwise, Larry Crowne is an average film, which you wouldn’t feel for whether you watched it or not. Watch it only if you possess undying love for either Hanks or Roberts.

597,695,695,695,695,[The] Last Lear,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewNotepadPreview17 Critic Reviews 2.5/5.0 2 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/the-last-lear-review/,2.5/5.0,4/5.0,,3.3,"Is it a play? Is it a movie? Whatever it is, it's a collage of brilliant performances. If only story had some clear direction!","I'm sure at most times, our mind works in moments, switching threads with or without connection, fluttering around various compartments of our lives. The Last Lear appears to be a peek into the writer's thoughts. We get glimpses playing out one after the other. Only, these glimpses are enacted by the most talented set of performers we have. What is it about? Broken trust? Guilt? An inside look at the passion a man feels for his art? Manipulation another equally passionate artist is capable of? The lives of three women and how one incident has marked their lives? A comment on how working women are treated by their men irrespective of the economic strata they come from? To bring about the difference between plays and cinema? A little bit of each, a whole lot of ultimately nothing. Now, whether this aimlessness is a result of Utpal Dutt's writing or because of the way it is adapted for screen by Rituparno Ghosh and Co. - I don't know. What I do know is it comes across as meandering all over the place. And the only undertones I can interpret are way too contrived to even mention here.The word 'realisitic cinema' is mentioned in the movie. True the characters and their situaions seem real. But there's one thing I don't understand about so-called 'realistic cinema'. Granted, they save us from the bright, eye-torturing color saturation. But does painting it all jaundiced yellow make it any more real? The nicotine tinge wouldn't have bothered me that much if any of the relationships were given apt attention. Also most of the Shakespeare verses sounded more mysterious than meaningful. And since I couldn't decipher the mystery, I sure hope that they were used in context with what was going on in the story at that point.Maybe the parallel narration could be blamed for adding to the patch-work feel. But, I liked how we know Harish Mishra (Amitabh Bachchan) bit-by-bit, sewn together by memories of various people who knew him and the warmth each one feels for him. But that's the narrative style; the character itself is more-or-less one-dimensional. Similarly we know very superficially, what the other characters are going through on that particular day. Shabnam (Priety Zinta) is confident yet vulnerable. Vandana (Shefaly Shah) masks her tender devotion with an arrogant poise. Just because Ivy (Divya Dutta) doesn't react doesn't mean she's dumb or heartless. Yet, I feel cheated, deprived from knowing them more, knowing them better.Despite this, the actors perform with such passion. And this is not just for Amitabh Bachchan. Priety, Shefali, and Divya are so convincing that for me the movie is more about their characters than Harish's. This is certainly the most I've seen Arjun Rampal's facial muscles move - he can actually do it! What a shame that it has taken so long!?Sir Bachchan - what do I say? That his performance was eloquent, his voice modulation articulate, his body language mesmerizing, his diction immaculate, his talent...? Such shallow words they are. Overacting? Maybe - in an off scene here or there. But, I was in awe, rubbing my arms to get rid of the goose bumps during his audition for the director. This in spite of the so unnecessary and out-of-place melodramatic lighting and camerawork. My favorite moments were those when he switched from Harish to a Shakespearean character and back in what looked like single takes.  'Moment' - that's the key word throughout. As Harish mentions, ""you never know when 'the moment' will come"". And you see them trying hard to create that perfect moment. But so engrossed are they in doing that, that the motivations of the characters and the movie remain blurry.

The film doesn't rise above them, but they don't let this silly, charming, boys film down either.","Men will be boys will be men. Will be boys. No matter how old a man gets, he's never old enough to have a spot of fun, even if life catches up with him sometimes. In Jon Turteltaub's Last Vegas, four 'boys' in their late sixties decide to get together and have some fun in Las Vegas, because, obviously, the last of them is about to get hitched.If The Hangover didn't end at the trilogy and went on and on and on, then in a few decades, you'd end up with Last Vegas; it is as easy a film to dismiss as it is to warm up to. What keeps it going is some honest camaraderie between the film's four lead characters, and some clean humour that never transgresses into 'haha' territory. (By clean, I don't mean sexually, because there's a lot of 'guy' humour, sexual innuendo and the likes, in the film. But clean in just the way that there seems to be no malintent in the way the film attempts to charm its audience.)Archie, Paddy, Sam and Billy have been friends for 60 years now, and they still share the same bond as they had as teenagers, even if some of them have had their ups and downs along the way. All said and done, they stand up for each other when the time comes.Each has their own issues in life, be it physically or emotionally. And this trip is, in a way, cathartic for them. Each of them enters as a different person, and for better or for worse, leaves a different man - and that's pretty much what the film is supposed to symbolize for each character - a snapshot of their own personal journeys with their best friends for company.Treated with a continuous stream of humour that has largely to do with their ages, the film doesn't have to try too hard to make you smile. The dialogue is never downright hilarious, often relying on just goody charm more than anything else. That, the veteran actors and their respective characters' quirks are enough to ensure that the film succeeds in being the frothy, breezy watch that it is meant to be. There are the occasional leaps of faith that the film expects you to take, but you don't mind them because it is all meant in good fun.The writing is nearly always predictable, and Turteltaub's direction isn't much more than functional. This is where the four veterans come in to save the day. Make no mistake, none of them is particularly outstanding in their roles. Just that these are men who've been doing this for years. The material doesn't challenge them one bit, and their natural talent and timing does exactly what is required to make it work.Kevin Kline steals the show as the adorable Sam, who has taken 'permission' from his wife for some hanky panky, if he is so lucky. Michael Douglas plays Billy, who is, well, pretty much Michael Douglas; suave, sexy rich bloke who's marrying a woman half his age. Two of my absolute all-time favourite actors - Morgan Freeman and Robert De Niro - seem to have made it their lives' mission to pick films and characters that aren't worthy of them. Last Vegas joins that list, but not before they each have at least a couple of scenes that genuinely make you smile, just because it is them.    The boys ensure that Last Vegas is watchable, and more so because it has become much easier to accept Hollywood mediocrity as long as it isn't a big franchise film. Last Vegas isn't an absolute must watch, but watching four grown boys have a bit of fun isn't particularly a bad way to spend a couple of hours either.

But, that is a fleeting moment. Other than that, it is a run-down version of a domestic bickering which is as baseless as many a domestic quarrels. Not that fights like these don't make for good stories or even movies. But when you don't empathize with the petty and selfish lady and the smitten boy, there's little hope. I'm all for negative characters as main leads and I like seeing the not-so-nice side of our heroes. But, these just don't inspire any interest.The performances could've been blamed had I gotten over how superficially written the characters were. For a bit, I did consider the possibility that the characters were intentionally made to be so inconsiderate towards the people around them, to portray the apathy of the urban youth. But towards the end, it is difficult to believe that was the intention.The rest of the writing, and movie too is as generic as it could get with hardly any meat in terms of dialogue, supporting roles, music, etc.Lekar Hum Deewana Dil is one of those films for which you can't even say that it could have been better or it had potential. It's more a case of been there, seen too many of those.
