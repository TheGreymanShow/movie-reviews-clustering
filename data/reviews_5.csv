0,700,700,700,700,Lessons in Forgetting,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/lessons-forgetting-review/,,,,3.0,"A film that talks about some of the most important gender issues plaguing India today, albeit one that is set in an interesting narrative, Lessons in Forgetting engrosses you because of what it is about as well as some of the performances. A film I’d recommend you watch, even if it makes you a tad uncomfortable while doing so.","Based on a novel by the same name by Anita Nair, Lessons in Forgetting, directed by Unni Vijayan, speaks about so many issues, big and small, but all pertinent and relevant, that it at once becomes an important film that must be watched, as well as a film that doesn’t make for an easy watch at all. The film gnaws away at what we know and think we know about relationships, people and society, through the journey that the characters in the film undertake, as they deal with loss. Set primarily in Bangalore and in a tiny coastal town in Tamil Nadu, the film also has a perceptible flavour of the setting, which makes it seem far more ‘real’ than most films we’ve seen lately. J. A. Krishnamurthy is an NRI who is back in India, because his daughter Smriti has suffered a severe, near-fatal accident. As he digs into the cause behind the accident, trying to get to the root of it, he also discovers that he knew his daughter far lesser than he’d ever imagined. Meanwhile, Meera is a middle-aged mother of two whose husband walks out on her without the slightest of warnings. As she deals with this, Meera and Krishnamurthy’s paths cross. Fashioned as a mystery that is in reality a human drama, a commentary on relationships and societal stereotypes, the film is rendered most relevant by the fact that it takes a long, hard look at the manner in which Indian women are seen in society today, and about another, far more gruesome and worrying truth of gender politics in India – the fact that to this very day in the 21st century, the interiors of India are still opposed to the birth of a girl child.But that is in rural India; we all know about that don’t we? All of us engage in social media outrage against the lack of education amongst the ‘other’ India about gender equality. How about in urban India, then? A man walks out on a marriage, but even the teenaged daughter holds the mother responsible for it, without a second’s thought. An outspoken, friendly, educated girl wants to wear a tank top because it is hot, and by nature she’s friendly with every guy she meets, but that automatically makes her an object that the men want to ‘own’. “She’s my girl,” exclaims one of her over-enthusiastic male friends, without ever bothering to find out if she feels the same way. The film offers no solutions; but then why should it? I’ve gone hoarse saying that cinema mirrors society, not the other way round, no matter how much people blame the portrayal of women on screen to be the reason behind men objectifying women in real life. The malaise is deep-rooted in our society, right from the time the girl is born. Before we begin eradicating the problem, we must recognize it. That, precisely, is what the film offers us; it holds up a mirror and reminds us that we need to change from within. In fact, there are portions in the film that will make your blood boil, as we see the just how spineless yet savage Indian men can be, when it comes to how they treat woman.The film also has an interesting narrative technique, albeit one that can sometimes work against it. It is non-linear, not just in space and time as it cuts between the present day and place where Krishnamurthy is and the lead up to what happens to Smriti, but it also has continuously shifting points of view – the past is carried forward bit by bit through the people who Smriti encounters along the way. However, this constant back-and-forth may tend to make you restless; the present day portions often seem like speed-breakers in the narrative. In fact, for a film that is only 96 minutes long, it actually seems far longer than that. The pace of the narrative sags often, with the screenplay meandering in the present day portions. Still, because of the nervous anticipation that looms large throughout and the performance of the lead cast, it still doesn’t bore you. Adil Hussain, who plays Krishnamurthy, is excellent. The desperation of a father, yet the sense of calm that he exudes even in tough situations, (contributed to, perhaps, by the fact that Krishnamurthy spent so many years in the US), those tears that he fights so hard to keep within, everything about his performance is almost perfect. I found his English dialogue delivery tinged with an ever so slight accent, but it is still heartening to see that an Indian film that is heavy in English largely stay away from terrible accents. It was also good to see Roshni Achreja after so long, and she was extremely natural as Meera. Some of the supporting cast did seem to struggle, especially the younger ones. Raaghav Chanana, last seen in that disaster Rangrezz as Jackky’s friend, has a good presence, though I couldn’t help wonder if that baritone was indeed his.Maya Tideman, who plays the pivotal role of Smriti, is a bit of a mixed bag. While the manner in which she emotes and delivers dialogue is often a little raw, she has a presence that seems to strangely do justice to the complex character that she plays. Your heart reaches out to her character not only because of the gruesome things that happen to her, but also she makes a connect with the sense of idealism and purity she radiates. And when I say purity, it isn't some misplaced sense of 'feminine purity', but just that of being a good human being.Despite some of the issues in pacing and the questions that you ask of the screenplay, Lessons in Forgetting is an important film because of how brave the film is in terms of subject and narrative. The only way our cinema is going to get better is if we whole-heartedly support films like this. So whether you choose to watch it in the theatre or whether you wait for the DVD to be released, I just hope that you pay to watch the film; Lessons in Forgetting deserves it.

The narrative is as flat. Nothing out-of-the-ordinary happens and you are left dissatisfied with the build-up and finale. The choreography and dances are nothing to swear by either. Some capable new actors brought on board though.","an unknown cast and makers, there's not too much the audience goes in expecting. A movie called Let's Dance the only thing, I guess you think you might catch a glimpse of are some new moves. Unfortunately there isn't anything spectacular or graceful about the choreography or the dancer. It ain't bad either, just the regular fare. I actually admired how the actor playing the protagonist, Gayatri Patel didn't come across as stunning or gorgeous. She is actually short and not stout but could be considered so compared to the other model-turned-actresses of today. She and most of the other cast had a very regular mannerism of talking except for Anjan Srivastav whose lines were delivered a little exaggerated. The cast otherwise looked like normal people going about their daily lives. This could also translate to boring. The official website boasts of six-year old Nikuunj Pandey as being ""by far the most experienced actor in let's dance."" Okay, there's it'd have been great fun to make full use of that information to trash the other actor's capabilities. But other than Aquib Afzaal's and Gayatri's accents the cast actually does a pretty decent job. And there is a non-trivial attempt at masking them accents too. All the actors bring across the character's traits. Aquib's attitude, Gayatri's sincerity, Ajay Chaudhary's chocolate boyishness, Master Abhaas Yadav's simmering frustration, and Sugandha Garg's practical approach to life - all add to the facets of the story. Unfortunately though the story doesn't move forward much, and when it does, it stays there for so long that it feels like no progress has been made. There are a few interesting elements in both the main and the sub-plots but they are extremely predictable. So, when the expected happens it is the usual feeling of anti-climax. It doesn't feel like the sort-of conflict leads anywhere because of the forgone conclusion. The transformations and events are all too convenient and basically a cop-out.If at all a little more was put in, in terms of creating an engrossing atmosphere, this film could have triggered a little interest. Alas, a good-natured plot and well-meaning characters can take a film only so far.

2,702,702,702,702,Liar's Dice,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/liars-dice-review/,,,,2.166666667,Lovers of indie cinema and fans of Nawazuddin Siddiqui should watch it if they have nothing else on their mind and are willing to put an effort.,"Another one from the Netflix catalogue, Liar's Dice is written and directed by Geetu Mohandas, who has earlier also acted in several Malayali films. The film is partially set in a remote village of Himachal Pradesh, Chitkul, and it intrigued me that a director from Kerala came to situate her debut Hindi film so far off, and that too with such nuance and conviction that it won two national awards in 2014 -- best cinematography and best female actor. Not just that, it was also India's official submission for the 87th Academy Awards in Best Foreign Language Film category.
Later, I learned from an interview that Chitkul was, in fact, a suggestion made by the film's cinematographer Rajeev Ravi (Chandni Bar*, Dev D, Udta Punjab.Mohandas uses both his suggestion as well his craft to her advantage. Cinematography becomes a great hook to begin with. A nicely framed abstract starting shot opens the film. It is abstract in that it is not connected to the story, as much as it is connected to the place, but it casts a strong, puzzling foreshadow. It's almost like a harbinger of times to come, events to unfold. This shot is followed by a slow paced montage of snow clad mountains framed by vernacular architecture, which plants you into this breathtakingly scenic village, and lets you soak the aura before you get entangled in the story. It also sets the pace of the film. Slow.The other strong anchor of the film is its beautiful, nimble but frayed female lead, Kamala, played by Geetanjali Thapa. Through her appearance and expressions, Thapa is able to remarkably convey a range of emotions with ease - uncertainty, vulnerability, helplessness, suspicion, determination, and courage. This isn't a dialogue-heavy film, so most acting is subtle, and Thapa excels.Yet another favourable point is the presence of Mr Nawazuddin Siddiqui in a major role.
With beauty, poignancy and talent thus stamped all over it, Liar's Dice makes a promising start. However, as it leaves Chitkul, it gradually loses steam and becomes cumbersome to watch. Content-wise, there's slowness in the development of events, repeatedness in the nature of interactions between the characters, and a prevailing sense of futility of it all. Technique-wise, all this is caught on camera at an unusual frame rate - I am guessing 30fps, which is higher than the conventional 24 or 25 fps. Due to this, most of the middle portion of the film loses cinematic appeal and beauty that was promised at the start. Together, the shortcomings of pacing and ill-effects of adopted frame rate make it difficult to retain interest.But wait you must, if you can, because, well, it is worth it. The ending is impactful and leaves you concerned, boggled and immersed in thoughts. It thematically links back to where it started but leaves some aspects unresolved, causing its inherent sense of foreboding to linger and haunt you. This, to my mind, is a good thing. I have always enjoyed being jolted by movies and remaining absorbed in a film after it gets over. But will you? In this case, I can't say.I have never been more unsure of recommending a film. On one hand is the rarity of distribution of this film, plus all the accolades it had gathered. On the other is the need for audience engagement. Depending on what you weigh more, you may or may not watch it. Lovers of indie cinema and fans of Nawazuddin Siddiqui should watch it if they have nothing else on their mind and are willing to put an effort.

Random, haphazard, rather pointless.","No doubt there is something very charming about a story line that starts with different threads and merges into one coherent story by the end. Life Ki Toh Lag Gayi kills that romanticized idea. It is indeed painful to write a review when you have only bad things to say about it. Except for the one quirky character Ajay Ghosh, Life Ki Toh Lag Gayi has nothing going for it. And this is despite having a cast that consists Kay Kay Menon and Ranvir Shorey!They do try their best, but what can they do with the little their individual threads do to contribute to the film. Individually a couple of their scenes work really well, but that's about it. But even that much cannot be said about Manu Rishi and Neha Bhasin's thread unless you call a hearty laugh at the writers, for calling Shakti Kapoor 'innocent looking', entertainment. Yes, it gets that crass at times. At others it alternates between plain silly and boring. It's difficult for me to get angry or hate something that a small budget film with a new director has tried to do. Life ki toh lag gayi only made me indifferent towards, which as is said, is worse than evoking hatred.

4,704,704,704,704,Life of Pi,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/life-pi-review/,,5/5.0,,3.15,"Rarely has a film looked and sounded as beautiful as Ang Lee’s Life of Pi. The Taiwanese master’s latest film is an enthralling theatrical experience, but could be a tad disappointing for those expecting it to be as philosophically deep as the book it is based on. Nevertheless, Life of Pi is something that you should experience on the big screen.","With an enviable filmography that underlines his terrific versatility, Ang Lee's cinematic adaptation of Yann Martel's Man Booker-winning novel Life of Pi, was easily one of the marquee films of the year, especially once the trailers of the film were unveiled. A gorgeous, visually stunning film that tries hard to retain the essence of Martel's novel, the film does succeed on that count, but only in some measure.Pi Patel, who seems to have an enchanting story behind every facet of his life, starting with the one behind his name, spends the formative years of his life growing up in idyllic Pondicherry. A fascinating boyhood, that includes devouring the works of Camus & Dostoyevsky and a unique tryst with religion amongst other things, is uprooted when his family decides to set sail for Canada, for good. Disaster strikes on their voyage, however, and Pi is stranded on a lifeboat, mid-ocean, with just a rather large, carnivorous feline and his spirituality for company.Make no mistake - with the best use of 3D since Hugo and with some truly exceptional CGI, Life of Pi is a sumptuous visual treat. Jaw-droppingly beautiful frames abound in the film, enhanced with a subtle, melodious and haunting background score. Life of Pi is a complete victory for both vision as well as execution, as far as recreating the world from Martel's book is concerned. The alternating rage and calm of the sapphire-blue ocean, the hypnotic sunsets, the nocturnal marine bioluminescence, everything visual in the film is a work of art.The peak of this is the tiger, which takes CG in cinema to an astonishing new level. Fur has historically been the toughest detail for animators to crack. Here, the fur that embellishes those beautiful, strong sinews is perfect. So realistic is the tiger in this film that, apart from a few chinks vis-à-vis scale and perspective, it is nearly impossible to tell that it isn't real.That said, Life of Pi is by no means a perfect film. It takes a while to get used to Irrfan (adult Pi) and Adil Hussain's (young Pi's father) horrendously awkward, fake Indian accents. It dampens the otherwise excellent performances from the two. Also, Ang Lee seems to have pushed himself in a corner attempting to direct so many actors from such varied nationalities in the same film - some of the side characters, in particular, are extremely wooden and unconvincing. Tabu, in a brief role as young Pi's mother, has a calming presence. Suraj Sharma plays the shipwrecked Pi, and he does a good job of it. But the non-CG cast doesn't hold a candle to the tiger with the charming human name - discover it for yourself if you haven't read the book - who steals the show.But really, the reasons why the film didn't meet my expectations were on a different plane altogether. Apart from all the hype this film has generated the world over, one of the reasons why I was really looking forward to this film was just how topical and relevant it is right now, particularly for us Indians. With two high profile deaths in the recent past, those with opinions and a medium to voice it spoke out loud, invariably with extreme views on each, particularly with respect to religion. But the opinions that were heard were, at the end of the day, minority opinions. The truth is that a majority of us are still grappling with what to make of God and religion. Life of Pi, the book, has the power to at least give our own views on religion some food for thought, to set the ball rolling so that we at least consider discovering for ourselves just why this essentially human construct has the power to sway minds the way it does. I went in expecting Ang Lee to achieve that same effect via cinema, and I walked away a tad disappointed. The task was daunting, no doubt, but it seems like Lee and screenwriter David Magee played it too safe with the issues they chose to concentrate on and the ones they chose to skirt. There is so much to like about Life of Pi, the film, that I would recommend it to anyone who loves cinema. But if the film manages to evoke some curiosity about the book and inspires at least a handful of people to actually read the book, delve deeper into the philosophy behind it and then question what they really know and feel about God and religion, that would be the real victory that Ang Lee would have achieved with what could have been his magnum opus.

5,705,705,705,705,Lincoln,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/lincoln-review/,,,,3.15,"Daniel Day-Lewis becomes Abraham Lincoln in Steven Spielberg’s cinematic portrayal of the final few months of the life of one of the best-remembered political figures in history. Profound in its depiction of Lincoln the man and daring in its treatment of the period, the film may not appeal to everyone because of its pace. Nevertheless, it is an important film, one works because of the performances and its outstanding authentic period feel.","Staying away from the constructs of a traditional biopic and concentrating on perhaps the most important months of Abraham Lincoln’s Presidency, Steven Spielberg’s Lincoln is a riveting character study and political drama. Widely regarded as one of the greatest American Presidents in history, Abraham Lincoln was an American hero, yes, but wasn’t one to shy away from playing political games when he knew that the result would be of benefit to the nation. Spielberg’s film takes a close look at this facet of Lincoln’s personality, showing him to be a man simultaneously of impeccable ideals as well as of great political acumen, something that seems like such a rarity today. Undeniably though, the greatest takeaway from Lincoln is the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role. Be it his look in the film - an uncanny replica of the real Lincoln – to his every mannerism, Daniel Day-Lewis virtually disappears beneath Abraham Lincoln. His creased face, that instantly recognizable beard, that slight hunch of his shoulders subtly showing the burden that the highest office in the country brings with it, the confident use of his hands, the reassuring smile masking a pensive state of mind – here is a master class in acting from one of the very best.The film is set in the latter half of the 19th century, during the American Civil War. The year is 1865 and President Lincoln has just been re-elected for his second term, while the nation grapples with the bloody effects of the war between the Union and the Confederacy. The Thirteenth Amendment to the United State Constitution, aimed at abolishing slavery, has been passed by the Senate and is now before the House of Representatives. A two-thirds majority is required for it to be passed in the House, but Lincoln’s Republican Party has only slightly over half of the number they require; the rest have to be obtained by winning over Democrats to vote in favour of the Amendment. In the tense political climate, the will and ability of Abraham Lincoln is tested to the full.What is remarkable about the film is how characters who are against the Thirteenth Amendment openly proclaim that all men aren’t created equal, how certain races are superior to others and how the ‘coloured people’ are meant to serve as slaves to the White Man. The dangerous, politically incorrect ‘N’ words are used freely, as it was in the period when the film is set. Seeing as how, even today, Indian cinema and audiences are subjected to naïve political censorship based on the whims of fanatical groups and spineless political parties, it is heartening to see a mature film-going audience that understands that one of the purposes of cinema is to inform as well, and how is one supposed to inform if one isn’t permitted to show the truth as it happened?The look of the film is a plus; the period feel is captured beautifully through the art direction and production design. Also, other than the gargantuan effort by Daniel Day-Lewis, there are other performances in the film that stand out as well, notably that of Tommy Lee Jones as caustic Congressman Thaddeus Stevens and David Strathairn as Lincoln’s Secretary of State. Sally Field and Joseph Gordon-Levitt do well in their roles as Mary Todd Lincoln and Robert Lincoln (Lincoln’s wife and oldest son, respectively) though one wishes that they had larger roles to play. Having said that, Lincoln isn’t for everyone. The film isn’t a collection of highlights of Lincoln’s career. It is, instead, a deeply rooted study of one particular phase that acted as a test of character for President Lincoln. It takes its time to unfold, because it is, almost at all times, long scenes of groups of men sitting together and talking. But that is probably how politics ‘happens’ in real life as well. The President himself often strays off course to deliver an anecdote invariably tinged with humour before making the point that he wants to. The film isn’t slow, because something is always happening. But what is happening isn’t action-filled; it is human minds at work. Thus, clocking in at two and a half hours, there will certainly be those who find the film boring. Lincoln isn’t the kind of film that will find universal appeal amongst theater-going audiences in India. But it will certainly appeal to those who are fascinated by history in general and by the character study of historical figures in particular. And for those who want a ‘fun’ film on Lincoln, there is always Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.

Otherwise, it's a disaster of proportions that can only be dwarfed and saved by the magnitude of great man's aura.","There is only so much that the searing, blistering persona of India's biggest superstar can do, when the film surrounding him is an ordinarily written, poorly directed and shoddily produced mess. The fact that Lingaa, directed by K. S. Ravikumar (director of one of Thalaiva's biggest hits, Padayappa,) is unworthy of the phenomenon that is Superstar Rajnikanth is no surprise, because very few films are. The disappointment lies in the fact that it fails to enhance or add to the legend of the great man - something that every 'commercial' film built around him now must strive to do.It can't be too hard, really. The very presence of Thalaiva means his fans will lap up absolutely everything with unconditional joy. Why not risk doing something that will push the envelope to unheard of places - the kind that will take Indian cinema itself to the next level? Shankar - the only Indian director who at least comes close to possessing the vision to match the Rajni aura - did it to some extent with Sivaji - The Boss and Endhiran. Even Soundarya's Kochadaiyyan was a film that at least tried something unheard of in Indian cinema. In the wake of these films, Lingaa is an unmitigated disaster, when seen purely in cinematic terms.The strange thing is that one can't accuse the film of not having a story, because it has one, and it is one that had potential. A thieving hoodlum and his sidekicks come to a village that depends on a dam for its livelihood - a dam that is tied intricately with an aspect of the man's past. There's a plot angle that it shares with Kochadaiyyan as well, though I don't want to reveal it here. Not revolutionary, but the story definitely had potential - especially since it gives the film a lot of openings to talk about issues that have been plaguing India all through its past and continue to do so even today.Thalaiva gets to play saviour yet again, and that's always fun to watch. The problem lies in the juvenile screenplay and some truly atrocious VFX - the kind that an intern at a mid-level animation house would be able to achieve with some amount of hard work. The film has so many in-jokes, so many references and hat-tips to the Thalaiva legacy, that it becomes hard to take seriously at any point. Superstar is what he is because of the characters he plays in cinema. To have a film that tries to be too clever with its references means that you're always breaking the illusion for the audience. They may be clap-traps, but they destroy the film in the long run.Another disappointment are the regressive sidetracks involving women. One would love to see a Rajnikanth film where the women have something to do apart from being objects of curiosity, and I'm sure Thalaiva himself would gladly acquiesce to be a part of such a film. Even the most hardcore and male chauvinistic Thalaiva fans wouldn't mind seeing him do such a film. The problem is the filmmakers who make their living by mooching off the Thalaiva aura clearly don't seem to think that women matter in the larger scheme of things. Sonakshi Sinha, who plays one of the two female leads in the film, plays the same ditzy girl she plays in every film that she's been a part of, save for Lootera. I'm surprised she hasn't exploded yet with the weight of the sheer same-ness of her existence.Is there a redeeming factor in the film? Of course there is - Superstar Rajnikanth himself. His screen presence is blinding, the conviction with which he emotes is inspiring, and the pure magic that can be the only explanation for the unlikeliest man becoming India's biggest screen god is on full display. There's no one like Superstar Rajnikanth simply because there is nobody like Superstar Rajnikanth. Everything else, including K. S. Ravikumar's slipshod film, pales away.

7,707,707,707,707,Lion,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/lion-2016-review/,,,,3.4,The film succeeds without resorting to too many contrivances or needless manipulation,"Lion is a good primer to the world of Charles Dickens. And - as if you'd need it as a cinema goer - to the world of Steven Spielberg. Dickens for its poignancy. Spielberg for its sophisticated simplicity.
Lion is a different movie depending on who is watching it. For South Asians or those familiar with the region, the story is a slice of life tale from the neck of the woods - told with sincerity and restraint.For anyone outside of that milieu, the film can be an emotional roller coaster - a tour de force which will wreck you and make you sob like well, a baby, by the end of it.As a visceral experience, the film succeeds without resorting to too many contrivances or needless manipulation. Even where it may seem a wee bit manipulative, it does so in a way that seems fair and transparent.The cinematography is lush and sweeping, capturing the earthiness of central India whilst the background score complements the tense narrative without being overwhelming.Sunny Pawar as the young saroo makes you fear for him and root for him at once. Priyanka Bose leaves a big impression in a small role - with eyes that only mothers seem to have - the kind that does not know but the way she looks, you know she knows.Dev Patel's face is a consistent index to his mind - and he shines and holds his own with the fabulous Nicole Kidman, who has only one strong scene and makes it the strongest and the most important stretch in the film.
Eventually, the movie is perhaps a little less than the sum of its constituent parts - then again, when it is Dickens and Spielberg in question, underplaying is the natural order of play.

8,708,708,708,708,[The] Lion King 3D,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review2 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/lion-king-3d-review/,,4/5.0,,3.4,"It’s a Disney classic; with traditional, hand drawn animation and good old motivational background music (given by Time Rice and Elton John). To release The Lion King in 3D is technological irony but it proves to be a decent effort, culminating the wholesome visual experience of 3D with a classic animated film. Watch the grander version of The Lion King if you’ve been a fan of the film, and run to theatres if you haven’t seen the film before! ","The guy who sells 3D glasses at the ticket counter must be thanking his stars right now. Every Friday a new film is added to his list of 3D films – the demand is increasing. To him, it doesn’t matter that most films are not shot in 3D, hence they end up with projection problems, dim viewing due to the tint of the glasses, and not to mention a headache that most walk out with. When news of The Lion King being released in 3D came around, there was panic. The original film released in 1994, uses traditional hand-drawn animation, which is 2D is nature. There was my childhood; virtually every moral lesson I imbibed, being re-released in 3D. Anybody would panic. But I had to watch it, it was a compulsive need – to compare and rant and crib about what the world had come to, in the name of commercialization (which is a bit hypocritical, I realized, because I owned every merchandise of the Lion King that existed.)Viewing the movie, however, makes you forget all of that. The epic sense of the film comes thoroughly, with the 3 D version (provided the projection is up to mark) and because it offers a new dimension to viewing the film, the re-release works. However, the experience is only mildly different; if you’re a fan of things flying at you and the sense of grandeur that you would inevitably get with the 3D effect then, the 3D version will  give you your money’s worth.  The Lion Kingis set in an anthropomorphic jungle in Africa called Pride Rock – where the royal family headed by King Mufasa is loved and respected by all. Life in the jungle is dutiful and simple and the movie begins with the birth of Mufasa’s son Simba. The family’s rival, Scar (also Mufasa’s brother) is constantly trying to overpower him to become the king. The film traces their story – of love, betrayal and honour.For those of you who have already watched the film many times over, the same points will make you cry, Scar and the hyenas will still manage to scare you, Simba and Nala’s growing love over Elton John’s classic ‘Can You Feel The Love Tonight’ will still make you smile with fondness and you will still feel a void when you walk out of the movies – at the end of the 2 most precious hours of nostalgia.Funnily enough, the voice-overs of side characters include familiar names like Rowan Atkinson (voice of Zazu, Mufasa’s right hand) and Whoopi Goldberg (voice of the female hyena in Scar’s army) and the background score is given by Hans Zimmer. Elton John and Time Rice have written and composed 5 songs in films – all of which have been re-touched and performed countless times at Broadway and live concerts. It would take you an entire day to listen to the various versions of the songs.For many (including me)The Lion King being released in 3D was essentially a revisit to our childhood - of days when Disney was about 2D animation and classic cartoons, and a time when we hadn’t heard of Hanna Montana or The High School Musical trilogy. Re-releasing the film in 3D, undoubtedly gives you that added advantage of watching the film on the big screen with effects and wholesome viewing experience. Otherwise, The Lion Kingin 3D includes your favorite moments, your favorite characters and another excuse to watch your favorite film, regardless of the visual dimension

The topic isn't broached often enough in films. But once it is, we know where it's headed, making this film predictable too.","It is only apt that the censor board wanted to censor a whole lot – it is about women's liberty after all.  When husbands and boyfriends, fathers and brothers, some times the women in their lives too, extended family, society, governments – all want a say in that liberty, why not the censor board?The metaphor of a “burkha” is underlined, emboldened and italicised – just in case you miss it. Every dialogue, every frame is a social remark, especially in the first half. The comment is that about oppression under the garb of protection, tradition, culture and so on. Fortunately, the stifled voices don't get preachy, even though they are empowered, alright. The comment is left at that, in stating the fact as a fact. This stays true to the texture of the film too. If the film provided an over-arching solution, it would be quite out of place. In that sense, Lipstick Under My Burkha has a perfect climax. Also, well done by the writing department is the dialogue and its delivery. The lines are snappy and people talk like people and not actors. The main characters – none of whom are “right” in what they are doing. If only, the “villains” of their lives were not so one-dimensional. Then again, that is what these people become for stifled women – villains, be it a father or the society at large. That is how these women make you feel for them. Each of these women – Leela (Aahana Kumra), Rehana (Plabita Borthakur), Shirin (Konkona Sen Sharma), Usha (Ratna Pathak Shah) - do what they really want to do. Yet, it is the struggle they have to go through, both internal and external, which makes them even more real.Of course, that is all due to the spot-on depiction by Ratna Pathak Shah, Konkona Sen Sharma, Aahana Kumra and Plabita Borthakur. Ratna Pathak Shah has the most difficult task at hand. The biggest bit is to depict the sexuality of a 55-year old, but her character is also the strength of many around her. This contrast between being a support system and yet needing a hand to hold is very rarely seen in Hindi films. This is the kind of greyness in character that makes you identify with the film's characters. Even if you are not 55 nor 17 like the characters; even if you are not a suppressed housewife or an outgoing woman with desires of her own, you know an aunt, a cousin, a friend who is/has been there. Which is what makes you let go of the skewed take on gender. For that aunt, cousin or friend the world is indeed a dark cage. Does it mean we paint all men with a broad stroke of black then? That doesn't seem right or real either. It is this, even if not overt, male-bashing and the self-pity that it masks that bothered me after a while. Like many “social issue” films, it is difficult to look at movies like Lipstick Under My Burkha, as just a story - like say a story of these 4 women of different ages, from different religions, with different support systems who happen to live in one area of a big city. You cannot not think of the issue they want to discuss. The movie clearly has an agenda and flaunts it on its sleeve. If it is the agenda then, I know it, I live it. Men are not all mean. The level-headed ones might not be living it, but they know and are supportive of it – at home, in the workplace. The other men are unlikely to see the film. Even if they do, they are more likely to laugh at Ushaji (like the few men in the audience where I saw the film) than become sensitive to her desires as real. How does this help? I wouldn't have asked this question had it not come across as the one thing the film wanted to do – sensitize the viewer. Even so, Lipstick Under My Burkha can  be watched for its snappy dialogue and sensitive, intense performances.

Watch in theater, not for cinematic brilliance but for a story well told. ","Mature love, love between a mother and a daughter, insecurity that a child might feel about her parents however old she might be - all this weaving in and out of memories as a theme. Listen...Amaya has to be one of the sweetest films I have seen in the last few years. Yes, there are moments of drama and there are very few moments that you wish were done better. But, for the most parts Listen...Amaya is a warm, touching film that keeps you engaged with its characters and how relatable they are.Amaya, Amaya's mother, Leela and the friends they make through their cafe are all very urban characters which make them very homely for us, the multiplex audience. It poses a few questions. The questions themselves or the fact that they were asked has the potential to make even the most liberal of us consider their appropriateness. What can make an adult daughter of a modern mother, both women of today, uncomfortable?The insight of some of the dialogue, small one liners stay with you when you walk out. The rest of the dialogue is the everyday kind you would hear in any of the city households and yet it is not mundane. The dialogue is made fresh by some wonderful performances by the lead characters. Deepti Naval and Swara Bhaskar are so comfortable and make you so comfortable about them that you forget you are watching a movie for a bit. You are completely involved in their interactions, so invested in their relationship for most parts of the film. Farouque Shaikh brings with him peace and stability as his character Jayant goes in and out of frames. You really begin to care for the aging Jayant, and his failing health. If only, the side characters could match up or even be half the potential of these three leads. Everytime, anyone other than these three is on the screen you are jolted into reality that it is only a film after all. Then there's a song that comes out of nowhere, ill-fit despite it's old-school-ness. Also, maybe for the build-up, the one necessary character transition came a little too quick. But, the manner in which the film ends makes up for the things that it misses. The matter of death of those you love and how different people deal with it differently, how time heals and how we associate loyalty and memories is brought about beautifully. A small gem like this makes the word 'genuine' spring for itself. A sweet story that would've meant nothing but for the performances. Performances which would have meant nothing if the story wasn't what it was. A film that makes your day not seem like a waste.

11,711,711,711,711,Little Black Book,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/little-black-book-review/,,,,3.866666667,"Aren’t we all tired of the same formulas churning out of chick flicks? Agreed, it serves a guaranteed purpose, but personally, on some days, I would like a film that swerves from the conventional ‘love conquers all’ motto. You can’t say if Little Black Book intends on being a satirical film on love, and you shouldn’t expect a cinematic gem out of this one - but it ends up putting a smile on your face because it allows you to relive those jealous, insecure moments of your relationship with absolutely no apologies.","Brittany Murphy was weird looking – she had a cute face, but bug-like eyes. It’s a pity she didn’t do any horror films in her time, bless her soul. She certainly had the eyes for it. And therefore, I had my reservations about seeing her in a chick flick. So I picked up a rarer film (she’s also done Uptown Girls and Clueless), because sometimes you can find the best performances in a film that many haven’t heard of.Little Black Book traces Stacy Holt’s (Murphy) dream of being a TV anchor. She works as an associate producer on an unsuccessful show – and she has an insecure relationship. Perfect fodder for a witty but fairytale-ending chick flick, right? Well, Little Black Book debases your expectations from the film – which is big win for me. But not in a manner that leaves you spellbound. We walk with Stacy as she spies on her commitment phobic boyfriend, by browsing through his Palm Pilot (Blackberry-type device). With a sloppy pace, we sift through Stacy’s insecurities as she meets with each of the ex-girlfriends and meticulously compares herself to them. The funny element in the film enters here. Probably the strongest reason for you to pick up the DVD (if you’re in a Sex in The City kind of mood that is) is this entire theme of unapologetic insecurity. Murphy  pulls it off perfectly and the credit goes entirely to her looks. While she meets the girlfriends, there is an entire laugh-worthy voice over that dominates the film. It’s raw, unapologetic and director Nick Hurran  does a great job of making the tone absolutely non-judgmental. The DVD of the film has only one feature (among extended trailers and theatrical posters), a making of called ""Live & On The Air: The Making of Little Black Book"". It’s a fun, entertaining watch because there’s a 3-min interview with Murphy where she’s asked if she would indulge in this sort of snooping around. Her calculated, diplomatic answers deliberately hide that tone of guilt which is exactly emblematic of the film. Little Black Book has the same kind of unabashed, satirical tone on self-righteous relationships in the eternal strife to be perfect. That way, the film is unlike most chick flicks. It almost promotes the snooping and the crazy neurotic behavior. In 2009, Murphy died of a cardiac arrest and most remember her as the strangely petite looking girl from films like 8 Mile, or the commercial-singing freak from Clueless. However, it’s in Little Black Book that she seems unnervingly charming in all her self-talking, insecure honesty. Little Black Book isn’t a great film; it has no real “story” which mostly overpowered by the need to make mush moments and be a winner among the chick flick lovers. We have flat performances; the side characters barely contribute, including the boyfriend Derek. But it’s in this sloppy film that you can see a sneaky, neurotic and underhand side to a relationship – a truly original interpretation of romance!

There are no great situations, but a couple of good lines here and there may give you a laugh. Do not compare to the predecessors, because sequels are almost always worse than the originals. ","‘Sequels are worse than the originals’ – is a clichéd statement. And so is Little Fockers. The story line is filled with the same old fight between two patriarchs over what the family culture should be like. Egos clash, and that makes life hard for Greg Focker and his family. The miscommunication and unbending attitudes in a relationship takes a toll on the family. But in a supposedly funny way. So even if each of us can’t identify with the situations, we can definitely identify with the reactions.There is very little of Little Fockers in this movie, though they are present all the time. The twins, Samantha (played by Daisy Tahan) and Henry (Colin Baiocchi), don’t look like twins but do justice to smart-kid and silly-kid roles respectively. And though this film is more about adults and their problems, the director has managed to drag in the kids on all occasions. Acting is generally mediocre. Ben Stiller is good, fed up of the father-in-law trying to bully him. He and Robert De Niro put up a good duet in the given situations. I was expecting much more screen time from Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Steisand, but looks like Dustin Hoffman didn’t like the script and accepted to shoot only 6 scenes. Well, after the movie I feel he was right. Jessica Alba obviously looks great – so if you are a fan you may want to catch this film. Some of the jokes are good, though there are also some irritating old ones. The best part is the slight flavor of The Godfather and Jaws. Just the right amount of reference was given which reassured me that this was not a spoof, and yet enough to make me smile remembering the classics. Although, it has one of the most uninteresting closing scenes ever. I mean, ending on a good note or a bad note is one thing. But an end which almost bores the audience, what sense does that make? The film certainly misses the hilarious situations that Meet The Parents and even Meet The Fockers had. So try not to compare if you want to have a laugh. Catch on a TV if you are really out of options. An empty mind might help getting over the frustration of ‘why on earth did they make such a film?!’

A good film and an important one, which needs to be supported and encouraged.","It is a challenge to distribute indie films in India. Seldom do they find a screening opportunity beyond a few film festivals. A case in point is Konkona Sen Sharma's directorial debut A Death in the Gunj (2016), which, even after being lauded across festivals, hasn't yet found a theatrical release. In such a scenario, when Netflix picks an even lesser known film like Loev, it is a moment to cherish. Yes, it isn't a theatrical release, but it is out and accessible. And that's what matters. (Netflix has got some more indie films in its collection, should you want to watch. These include Miss Lovely, Gandu and Brahman Naman, to name a few.)Love can be complicated and Loev doesn't make any attempt to simplify it for you. It doesn't even set a pretext. Instead, it takes you straight to its protagonist, a shirtless young man, preparing for a road trip, harrowed by the forgetfulness of his flatmate.Beginning there, the film gradually and slowly unravels a triangular romantic equation between three young men. And rather than dwelling on how they met or what may happen to them, Loev stays focused on the equation while using conversations as the key storytelling device to expose just enough details about these characters that seem to matter to the story. In between these conversations, it takes pauses to glance at the lushness of idyllic settings. The film is shot on location in and around Mumbai (Wai and Mahabaleshwar) but manages to very cleverly avoid the cluttered touristic places with the use of high-angle long shots. The cinematographer doesn't seem to meddle with the setting too much to get a perfect shot. It just lets nature be, and captures its vastness in an unhindered way by distancing the camera as much as possible. Similarly, the director doesn't meddle with the characters too much, just lets them explore nature as well as, maybe, the nature of their relationship. Not much really happens. And am glad that the screenplay allows the men to wonder, wander, think and agonize more than I have seen in some other LGBT films.But if it was just about platonic exploration, the film might have become boring. So, the director has thrown in ample amount of sexual tension to keep the audiences hooked. And in dealing with sexual tension, Loev doesn't succumb to clichéd homoerotic depictions (remember Dunno Why Na Jaane Kyun from 2010?). Instead, like old romantic movies, it weaves a profound atmosphere with threads of vulnerability, muted agony, and unrequited desire. Loev thus hinges mostly on the sublime side of love. I say mostly because the carnal isn't completely ignored. It is included as a significant plot point, which, although tackles the burgeoning sexual tension, also gives rise to a muffled cacophony of diverse emotions. These were a little hard for me to fathom, so I felt lost a bit after this point. Luckily the story had already reached its denouement by this time, so the confusion didn’t last too long. Nevertheless, the silence of idyllic pauses could still manage to ring through the layers of conflicting emotions, establishing that the true grit of Loev lies in echoes of those quiet moments. The actors deserve to be appreciated, especially the two leads Shiv Pandit and late Dhruv Ganesh. I had noticed Shiv in Shaitan (2011) where he had held his own among a rather skilled ensemble cast that included Kalki Koechlin, Kirti Kulhari (Pink), Niel Bhoopalam ([24]) and Gulshan Devaiah (Hunterrr). I haven't seen any other work of Dhruv Ganesh. It was heartbreaking to learn that he passed away before the release of this film. The mischievous spark in his big eyes symbolised youthful energy, and coupled with some really good acting skills, he expressed sincerity, boredom, uncertainty and pain effortlessly. He was superbly talented. What a loss!I was also saddened to read that the movie had to be shot in secrecy because of the growing vigilantism against homosexuality in the country. Loev is a good film but given this news piece, it becomes an important film, which needs to be supported and encouraged. However, if you still live in denial of same-sex romance, it may not be an easy watch. So, do exercise your caution.

Great subtle humor yet a punch is lacking.,"Each character sketch is a stereotype. Each dialogue is sharp and smart and works towards setting the stereotype deeper into the mould. Not a word wasted. Each member of the cast playing their role to the tee. And yet, there was something amiss. I can make a long list of things that I did like. But two hours later I am still unable to articulate exactly what it is that didn’t make it an instant hit.It is not a “laugh-my-heart-out” type of comedy. But it did have those satirical elements that kept a smile on my face for the entire duration. All characters are very close to real-life; enough to be freely available for each one of us to encounter at some point or the other in our lives. Each one of course, is exaggerated a tinge to underline the sarcasm. Jabs are taken at many social double standards. It is the type of humor I enjoy, the subtle, tongue-in-cheek types.  But yet, it felt incomplete. The overall idea is pretty cool. What more could we as viewers want? A reality show, which is done in less than 90 minutes instead of 19 weeks. No safety circles or unnecessary tension filled eliminations! However, the details of the story seem off - a little too flat. There are no particular ups and downs. But, then again, who ever said that every story needs an arch? Also, how many ups and downs do our lives go through over a weekend? So, in that simplistic sense the story is not bad either, but it leaves something wanting. There are finer details that seem unrealistic in this otherwise authentic setting. I must say though, that it has one of the most amusing anti-climatic climax.Acting, by one and all, is absolutely outstanding. No one can be better when veteran Shabana Azmi is in the cast list. But, Manish Acharya himself (he is also the director) does a marvelous job of playing a nerd - being self-absorbed yet conscious of being a misfit, the coy boy who has no clue how to deal with women. Technically what stood out was the minimal use of background music and camera movement. Like many things in life, it is what you don’t do that makes things better. Realistic characters, realistic setting, but yet a story that is not completely believable. All-in-all, it is more of a “relaxed Sunday afternoon at home” movie than a “rush to the theater this instant” one.

15,715,715,715,715,Lokmanya Ek Yugpurush,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/lokmanya-ek-yugpurush-review/,,,,3.966666667,Subodh Bhave's classy act gives a great tribute to Tilak.,"After seeing the teaser of Lokmanya - Ek Yugpurush way back in 2012, I had doubted the film's intentions in the first place. My biggest worry was that it might end up becoming just another biopic that is high on so-called patriotic statements or the ones that question our socio-political culture. As the film begins, Nana Patekar's sarcastic voiceover (compelling, still to some extent questionable) appears to be following the latter track. This theatrical commentary continues until the intriguing showmanship unravels.A biopic on an illustrious personality faces its primary hurdle right in it's story. For people familiar with that individual, there are barely any surprises. And someone unfamiliar might feel alienated from the drama. So the real challenge of such a biopic is to appease people from both worlds. This is what Lokmanya - Ek Yugpurush uses to its advantage so masterfully that it seems the history is being replayed right in front of your eyes. No matter which world you are from, you stay gripped to that golden era throughout.If history is all you are getting to see in a film, what's the point of going to theatres? I mean, information is always a few clicks away. This is another challenge Lokmanya - Ek Yugpurush braves, all thanks to its approach to storytelling. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, fondly called as Lokmanya, played a significant role in India's freedom fight with the British. Instead of directly bombarding you with the history, director Om Raut makes you witness his struggles through the eyes of a journalist (Chinmay Mandlekar). Not only does this film succeed in depicting the magnitude of Lokmanya Tilak and his achievements, it also effectively comments on our ignorance towards his visionary ideas.Make no mistake, this film is absolutely no great piece of writing. With all due respect to its production values, this film is not even half dazzling without Subodh Bhave. I doubt if anyone (not even Raut himself) can imagine this extravaganza without him. Yes, some of the dialogues are splendid. But who is bringing them to life? Bhave has proven his mettle time and again. But this occasion, he takes his craft to another level.Direction, on the other hand, lacks persistence and meticulousness. Some of the sequences are needlessly glorified. Several key elements surely help disguise a few casual moments (read mistakes). But no blunder comes close to the choice as well as the quality of visual effects. Some galaxy-like effects at the Mandalay Prison make the whole effort look stupid. I don't know if the director wanted to give a divine feel to Tilak's character. However, his character itself is so powerful that the rest of the glorification appears irrelevant.Raut forcibly spoon-feeds you almost everything. His eagerness to give away an outdated (still popularly overused) conclusion, questions viewers' sensibilities. Had he let audiences perceive the film's takeaway, it would have had more impact.Yet, despite all the downsides, Lokmanya - Ek Yugpurush leaves you with a gratifying experience.

There are moments atypical of Hindi films. There's the regular Bolly-masala. It entertains and it engages but not for the entire length. Ultimately like many films longer than 2 hours it doesn't arrest you in your seats.,"Friends are forever or maybe they are not. Or maybe they become best of friends except for that thin line that still keeps them apart. Does being human mean taking care of yourself or does it mean giving yourself to one and all? Can a human be so selfish or so selfless? Both nauseating in their own way? Well, it takes all kinds to make this world. And that I guess makes it an interesting place to live in albeit insane. Yes. A Vipul Amrutlal Shah film made me think beyond what was going on, on screen. And this is, despite having a few of the quintessential Hindi film touches to it.That's because it ALSO had broader non-standard and pleasantly surprising strokes. Example, there's no one event or line that transforms the good to evil or vice versa, the character is written in such a way that the transition is smooth. Another such stroke, which I thought made this entire film worth its while, was Arjun's (Ajay Devgn's) character. His traits established, the passion that drives him to his goal and maybe even to insanity. Whether or not he achieves his goal and/or insanity is for you to go and watch. And that's the beauty. The film maintains a dark-ish atmosphere where you know anything could happen and it's equally likely that the film won't end on a popular note. And that keeps the interest alive. Ajay, of course, makes and maintains the serious ambience through the film. The twitches and the way the eyes move to disclose what's on Arjun's mind are not to be missed. But, then again it's a mainstream Hindi film and it keeps reminding you of that. For instance, almost all the other characters are pretty much flat. Including Manu (Salman Khan) and Priya (Asin). And the actors didn't do much with whatever little scope their characters had either. Salman Khan is his usual stuff. His comic timing is best at some of the really funny lines given to him. It's amazing how the man can do the same thing over and over and over and still have his fans cheering and hooting for him all through. Though in this one there are a few dashes of facial muscle movement here and there. In a script that did so much with the male protagonist, it’s a shame that the lead woman was so etchily sketched. She could have been more involved. She could at the very least have not disappeared from one of the most crucial plot points in the film! The show-down is a bit too much to swallow. And the climax came way too quickly and was abrupt. Yes, and I'm still complaining about its length. It's sad when a film is long and you still find something amiss. Whatever the drawbacks of the film are in terms story or dialogues the improvement, in the entertainment-quotient of these two departments (of a Vipul Shah film) came as a pleasant surprise. And so did the aesthetics in terms of cinematography and sound design. Maybe just losing Akshay Kumar might have done the trick. Ok, sorry, couldn't resist that unwarranted dig. It's a film that makes you want the hero to win and the anti-hero to not lose. You flinch when the latter is punished and want to reach out to him and tell him it's ok. This one also has a strong hard work vs. talent+charisma debate as a backdrop. But the drama goes on a tad too long. Long enough for you to notice the holes in the other departments. And there they lose us.

But this time the story and characters touch your heart. Mostly. Ultimately, London Paris New York falls prey to typical drama. ","I was rather wary of watching the fifth rom-com/romance  in four weeks. Images of Ali Zafar from Mere Brother Ki Dulhan didn't help. So, you can imagine my surprise when I started being drawn to the characters and involved in their stories within the first ten minutes or so. The cute lines, the casual build-up and the performances keep you engaged and smiling throughout. When Ali Zafar doesn't do the sigh-in-mouth dialogue delivery, he is quite the charmer. You'd fall in love with Nikhil, the character he plays, for just the way he looks at Lalitha. You don't need anything else to convince you how much he is in love with her, even when she's questioning it. His disappointment reaches out to you whenever you, with him, think that he can't have her.For now, Aditi Rao Hydari, didn't need to do anything other than just be there for me to not take my eyes off hers. Her eyes emote genuine warmth, and more generally her persona is captivating. That besides she carried both the regular girl-next-door, disheveled-hair look and the sizzling Parisian style with equal ease.And there is nothing more to London Paris New York. Just Nikhil and Lalitha. The usual cinematography of these cities have ceased to impress me to the extent that I might not be in awe of the Eiffel Tower/Statue of Liberty or the London bridge when I see them the next time. Nikhil and Lalitha though, being shown their way by Ali Zafar and Aditi Rao Hydari are delightful. Their chemistry is riveting and goes beyond every time they come within a foot's distance of each other. Even otherwise, it was fun watching them hold the mirror to each other's shortcomings. Made them very human and relatable.It's only a bummer then, that they chose the regular route to end the film - long-winded, unimaginative, disappointing and thus unforgivable. When the film broke for half-time, I could hear surprised sounds from the audience, many of us didn't realize how 45-50 minutes of the film had passed by. Even post-interval there were some well-composed sequences that made me worry about how little time the film had to wrap itself up. That is ALWAYS a sign of a film made well. Thus far.No matter how many films I see suffer from the first-half-second-half syndrome, often after seeing a good first half, I find myself forgetting at interval that it could still go downhill. The last ten or so minutes of London Paris New York rudely reminded me of that common pitfall. But thankfully, the film is short enough that the good parts are impactful enough to overcome a part of the disastrous last ten minutes.

18,718,718,718,718,Looper,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/looper-review/,,,,3.2,Rian Johnson’s sci-fi time travel flick ‘Looper’ is the kind of film that will grab you by the throat and demand your attention. Twists abound in this fast-paced film as you are drawn in and the foundation is laid for a pulse-pounding finale. Its writing flaws can be ignored in favour of the sheer entertainment that the film provides.,"Rian Johnson’s Looper, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, is a thrillfest of a film - fast-paced with twists and turns that hook you by the minute; so much so that in all of the time you spend on the idiomatic edge-of-your-seat, you may overlook some serious screen-writing flaws and plot holes. Still, considering that it is a sci-fi film based on time travel, getting an airtight script is a near impossibility, and Johnson’s deft direction doesn’t give you enough time to dwell on any of the flaws longer than the time it takes for the next cut.The fun-and-games begin with a voiceover – Gordon-Levitt’s – that introduces you to the concept of a ‘Looper’ and sets the context for the film. In the future (2074 to be precise) when time travel is invented, it gets instantly outlawed. It is then used only by the mob and for one specific purpose – people they need killed are sent back in time 30 years (2044, which is much of the ‘present’ in the film) to be killed by a Looper. Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, a Looper, who’s life seems rosy until his future self – Old Joe, played by Bruce Willis, is sent back to be killed by him to ‘close the loop’.The concept of time travel is tricky, because there are virtually a gazillion ways in which one can go wrong when depicting it on screen – simply because there is absolutely no point of reference for it. Rian Johnson’s time travel raises a lot of fundamental questions as well, which would be considered plot holes if it weren’t for the fact that he has given a number of interviews clarifying these holes. But directors’ interviews aren’t part of the film, so the flaws still stand. Also, Gordon-Levitt’s voiceover popping up every once in a while to clarify things is the biggest problem with this film. It is a directorial and screenwriting flaw, the fact that they couldn’t suck the viewer into the world of the film and blow their minds without resorting to something as un-cinematic as a voice-over. Even as it stands, the film does blow your mind. But it could have been taken to the next level if they could have achieved it without the VO.But as mentioned earlier, these flaws are swept away because of the merits and the pace of the film. Rian Johnson’s depiction of the future is grungy, with unlikely technological advancements kept to a bare minimum. Tiny details like a new narcotic that is consumed by dropping it into the eye add to the world that Johnson creates. Also, the non-linearity in the narrative is handled with remarkable maturity – no cheap tricks to heighten the drama in repeated scenes shown from different points of view. The film also has an unlikely family angle to it that really sets it apart from regular action flicks.Gordon-Levitt is extremely convincing as the Looper who is trying to hunt down his future self. The prosthetic changes to his face do take some getting used to, but you eventually settle into it, since the point of them is to increase his similarity to Bruce Willis. Willis himself has done well with his deadpan action and dry wit. Emily Blunt is excellent as well, even though I can’t even begin talking about her role here, because it will just give too much away.Looper is the kind of the film that will demand a second viewing just to see if your mind is equally blown the second time, but it doesn’t lend itself well to too much deconstruction. The mysteries and plot details that beg questioning will mount the more you analyze it. But it is also the kind of the film that will spawn a lot of interesting forums and analyses on the internet – like all such movies tend to do. But then isn’t that the point of cinema anyway, to open up discussion, to be ripped and torn apart so that those of us who live cinema can fuel our hunger? Looper must be watched, enjoyed and debated.

19,719,719,719,719,Loot,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review23 Critic Reviews 0/5.0,/movie/loot-review/,0/5.0,,,3.45,"Loot is confused between being a regular, loud slapstick and being one of those several threads converge to make a ""cool""  pulp kind-of a film. ","Loot starts out the same old plot with four wannabe thugs setting out to loot something or the other. They are four but are almost alike when it comes to characteristics and quirks. They are loud, they crack wannabe jokes, they objectify women and sing and dance for no good reason. Their world is full of thugs and they encounter only their kind even when they go into a new world. And slowly Loot has a couple of twists and it becomes marginally interesting mainly because you weren't expecting a story to be thrown at you. I actually felt grateful even though the story is too convoluted to hold that interest for too long. But let's just better than nothing, it surely was.Loot also came across as a confused film because the acting and the dialogue were your run-of-the-mill slapstick, but the texture, the tone of the film is classier and the overall plot has a little more meat than usual.Loot is one of those films that you could stop by while flipping channels, ridicule the non-sense going on on-screen, get frustrated that you can't make sense of it and move on.

Literally translated it means 'pause' or even 'permanence'. But a usage that applies better is when the word is used for notes to be held while singing. To keep the voice from cracking or going flat while holding a note, a singer needs control of breath and voice. This is the control you see in Lootera. And the moment you see yourself using a word applied to music, while watching a film, you know you are not watching just a film, it is poetry in motion. There are a few points which put you off what's going on but the beauty of the climax sets everything right.I haven't seen a climax as mesmerising as Lootera's. It's not a twist, it's not a revelation. In fact, it is predictable. It is just pure love. It is a shame then, that the makers felt the need to explain it in such detail with flashbacks and repetitions. And I am in love with the finish, despite this reservation.I am getting ahead of myself though. The first thing that should be told to people who want to know whether or not they should watch Lootera is that the film takes its slow pace very seriously. It is almost as if the makers want to push the envelope on how long a pause can be held, a scene can go on without background music, and so on. It does help that the film is set in the 50s.  The times when, most likely, people enjoyed their pauses. To top it off, you have a palace, the majesty of which is waning with the abolishment of the zamindari system. Amidst this is the daughter of a zamindar (Pakhi) who is falling in love with a guy who's job it is to take advantage of the zamindar's situation (Varun). There is something not so old school about the way Varun's (Ranveer Singh) relationship with Pakhi (Sonakshi Sinha) develops. Sure, there are distances and awkward exchange of glances but there is also boldness about Pakhi's demeanour that you do not associate with the 50s. Yet, this does not take away from your experience. And of course, references to films and songs from that era take you charmingly back to the ambiance of the film. Also, along with the 'paused' treatment, the film has a heavy grainy texture to add to the feel of that era - something reserved for flashbacks in films. You do feel like you are watching a two-hour long flashback, like someone has transported you to those times to narrate a story to you, that can be best enjoyed only if it is told only in that one tone. The camera complements this tone and moves like it is in love with its object. Be it Sonakshi or a street in Dalhousie or a barren tree. The performances then are like the last cog that need to fit in well, to make this clock work. While one can say that both Ranveer Singh and Sonakshi Sinha got by with just one or two expressions, it would be unfair to them both. With the limited range that the roles offer, you don't know what to make of their performances. And when you don't know if an actor acted well or not, it is safe to say they did a darn good job. After all, you are rooting for Varun even though he has wronged other people grossly. You don't think Pakhi is being stupid when she is falling in love, despite herself. You know her confidence, you know her insecurity. And her elegance shines through both. A couple scenes between them will stay with me for a long time. 
The dialogue is kept simple. No way does it want to interfere with the silences, neither do you want it to. There is a little bit of fun thrown in every once in a while but it always keeps with the spirit of the film. There are lapses in the way the story plays out and they are rather looming ones or rely heavily on coincidence. And yet, if you are in for a sweet-paced travel back to 60 years ago, you let go of those. If you want action and entertainment (in the funny fun sense of the word), you don't want to watch Lootera at all. It has no story, as such. Nothing is going to 'happen'. It is a simple love story.

With a creepy background score and inventive dialogues, writer-director Billy Wilder evocatively captures the helplessness of a struggling writer who cannot help but be lured to the depths of addiction before he begins penning his novel.","Story-tellers have often been fascinated with the depths a man plunges to under the influence of alcohol. If you can think deep about how addiction affects creativity, career, love, family, society and you've got fodder for a plot,  it's good enough to be woven into a screenplay. From India, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's  Devdas , was spun into various versions on screen. In the West, one of the earliest films made on this theme, is Billy Wilder'sThe Lost Weekend.Filmed in 1945, after Wilder chanced upon a novel by the same name on a railway journey to Hollywood, The Lost Weekend, a story about four days in the life of a chronic alcoholic, is possibly one of his best written films. I say so, because there have been few films that have articulated the effects of alcohol on the human mind, the desperation that follows, when one drink is too much and yet, even a hundred more are not enough. That’s exactly the dilemma of the film's protagonist Don Birnam (Ray Milland, in an Oscar winning performance), a struggling writer who after being hailed as Hemingway as a 19-year old in college, is 33 now and cannot put pen to paper, because his mind is always asking him ""to have a drink first"".Wilder makes Birnam express his desperation, frustration and helplessness through memorable lines and while doing so, provides a great commentary about an alcoholic's obnoxious nature in society and his obsession with getting his next fix. The gravity of Birnam's situation is expressed through fantastic close-ups. In a scene where Birnam is settling down for a drink, he is shown removing his coat and sitting on the sofa - Wilder almost equates Birnam's relationship with alcohol as sexual in nature. There are also scenes where he uses characters to illustrate society's condemnation and lack of hope about the writing profession, something which adds to Birnam's woes and makes him drown his sorrows even more, in alcohol. What amazes is how little time the screenplay takes in establishing Birnam's condition. As the film progresses through a linear narrative, interspersed with flashbacks, Wilder guides the viewer scene by scene, to what depths Birnam has fallen, to get his liquor. He also uses satire with good effect - a rehab centre is named 'Hangover Plaza' and some regulars there are former advertising professionals! A special mention about the terrific background score - a classic trademark in all Billy Wilder films - which gives the film an eerie feel, unheard of, in a genre like this. Some scenes are frightening, especially the hospital scene towards the end, which has me squirming, every time I watch it. Wilder uses lights, doors, sounds and Birnam's close-ups to great effect. In my view, the biggest reason why the story of The Lost Weekend is a classic, is that 65 years later, mankind is still battling with addiction, rehab centres haven’t changed their treatment measures and the expression on the face of a man desperate for his next glass of liquor, is still the same. Bravo, Mr Wilder.

It’s an easy, smooth film that will lift your senses and stay with you for a while after you’ve watched it. Thankfully, you will not have to leave your brains anywhere. ","Have you noticed the rising background music that almost every rom-com plays in the climax? It’s a predictable pattern – rising piano melodies and beats, a raging one-liner, which changes the course of the film, “You had me at hello” (Jerry McGuire) or “It was magic” (Sleepless in Seattle). Following which, the music stops, for the ground breaking 30 seconds of revelation. And then the pair kiss; over a slow sax playing in the background. Even though we love seeing our familiar faces – Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant, and Richard Gere – do the romance ritual, we could each write a thesis on it.A Lot Like Love, too, is predictable, but only the kind that you like to relish on a love-starved day. It’s a story of two stark opposites (predictability no. 1) Amanda Peet and Ashton Kutcher, who meet on a flight while still in college. Sparks fly, (no 2) but with one slight variation. Peet is looking for some airplane-washroom-action, while Kutcher seems love struck. They find excuses to keep in touch and this sparks off a series of meeting over 10 years. They grow up, but not with each other – and in each phase, they manage to run into each other. The fun bit of the film is that every chance meeting isn’t predictable; the lead actors have a crackling chemistry and the soundtrack is extremely sensual, funny and passionate - very much in sync with the film. A Lot Like Loveis fresh, because it doesn’t need to rely on stereotypes to reveal a growing bond between the lead pair. With each chance meeting, year after year, the chemistry/repressed emotions get more and more palpable. Much like the rising piano melodies that are intrinsic to a climax of a rom-com, A Lot Like Love’s script (written by Colin Patrick Lynch) rises with every plot point, to a predictable climax, you want the movie to move in a pace where you can absorb every moment of growing passion.The DVD, released by Bueno Vista Home Entertainment, has a couple of negligible bonus features – an audio track by director Nigel Cole, deleted scenes and blooper reel that is very hilarious courtesy Ashton Kutcher and a music video of Aqualung’s 'Brighter Than Sunshine', possibly the best song on the soundtrack.We all like to be intellectually stimulated, but there’s a different joy in reaching out to a more expressive side within you, that likes the regular dose of mush. Unlike typical romantic movies, A Lot Like Love is a crisp, fresh and well-paced love story of two very lovable characters. It’s A Lot Like Love, not all love. It’s partly wit, partly humour and lots of smile-worthy moments!

If you can't handle a ""different"" kind of love story - the practical, the contemporary, the possible - just shhhush away this instant! No need to read further. If you think you are game for a romantic film that is well thought over - don't go on reading this, book your ticket and one for me too. I can watch this one with each one of you again and again! The world wide web won't eat the detailed review before you come back, I promise!","At the risk of sounding extremely snotty, I didn't think I'd ever consider having a Hindi romantic film on my list of favorites. But, here I am, guilty as charged with a strong contender. There should have been 200% of credit to give away which would then be split between writer Imtiaz Ali and director Imtiaz Ali. The writer's decision to pick 2 characters and just focus on developing them, making them grow as people and yet keeping them consistent is a difficult one. It must have been tempting to shoot off into sub-plots. I'm glad they were ruthlessly avoided. My admiration for various directorial decisions kept building as the movie began. If the first few minutes of the film make you worry, it is only intentional. Trust your capable director. From the background music or lack thereo,f to the way the scenes were sewn together, the director's role is obvious. Almost every 4th or 5th film reviewed here has background music by Salim-Sulaiman but this one was so-not-in-your-face. The flow of the film from one love story into another and back is seamlessly swift. It actually reminded me of Rang De Basanti, only better, because the story was more human. Another brilliant stroke of genius is not losing the crux of the story to commercial viability. Yet it does keep the tone light enough to engage as many people in the audience as possible. Cracked the Midas touch, have we? 
I haven't particularly liked Deepika Padukone in her earlier films but seeing her in the cast line-up I knew if there was a person who could get her to emote it would be Imtiaz Ali. Just like he did with Kareena Kapoor in Jab We Met. And I wasn't disappointed. At least, now we know Deepika can do better than what she has done thus far. We know she can come out of the model-like within-her-frame body language. Though I seriously doubt the taste of costumes chosen for her in ""chor bazaari"". Minor irritant - shall be ignored. Of course, Saif Ali Khan has played many a romantic role. But being playful yet intense, contemporary and old-fashioned, happy but dissatisfied isn't something many lead actors in the industry could pull off. And the transition in his character is believable without being inconsistent. Looks like I'm sort-of back to being in awe of the writing. It makes you think. Is there point in pulling on a relationship that is not practical? Is it practical to give up on a relationship that means so much to you? Do you really know how much something means to you till you push it away and try to take it back on your own will. These are times when before you can ask ""Do you love me?"" you know the reply ""What is love?"" Does having it mean binding or finding someone who liberates you? Does not having it mean a space that needs to be filled or is it good riddance to bad rubbish? There are no solutions to these issues, let alone easy ones. And this one doesn't really give you an answer but it is a film and if it has a set-up and a conflict, it has to have a resolution. This is one of the most satisfying climaxes in a love story. And yet like a friend I watched the movie with said, ""I hope the 'wrong' friends don't get the wrong message."" That sentence will make sense only when you watch the film. And watch the film you must! So go already! And if you've already been, isn't it worth another watch?And the beauty is if you are not the type who likes to think so much for entertainment, you'll still enjoy it. As far as looking for the flaws, I'll watch out for those the second time around. Till then I'd like to be with this feeling of having enjoyed a film completely.

24,724,724,724,724,Love Breakups Zindagi,Watch when on TV/online,wogma reviewNotepadPreview24 Critic Reviews 1.5/5.0 4 Reader Reviews 4/5.0 21 Tweet Reviews 2.9/5.0,/movie/love-breakups-zindagi-review/,1.5/5.0,4/5.0,2.9/5.0,2.8,Love Breakups Zindagi is a very sedate kind of a relationships film. It is a casual and everyday-like take on the subject but it also turns out to be long-drawn and boring. Not worth a trip to the theaters for the one or two insightful things it has to say about romantic relationships.,"Love Breakups Zindagi has very deliberately written and made film. You can see the thought put in the growth of the characters and their interactions. Unfortunately, the makers aren't able to build momentum soon enough. They take too long to establish the chemistry between various characters and it ends up being a little too slow.Unfortunately, this happens because they are trying to imitate life. It takes time to establish friendships and romantic relationships. The little things that attract people to each other take their own sweet time to reveal themselves. Real people give a lot of thought before breaking up with their partner and it is a tough decision. But, there are times when the slow pace works in a film and there are times when it doesn't. In Love Breakups Zindagi it mostly doesn't. Sadly, it is not for lack of trying. I really like the simple theme picked to make the film about, ""Opposites attract, but choose a like-minded partner"" but ironically, the simplicity makes it too dull. The effort is visible. The restraint in spending about 30-45 minutes of a film in a wedding set-up and keeping it quite is visible and I actually appreciate it too. But, the dialogue is too plain and thus too boring. Maybe, if the film were left to better actors, it would have pepped the film up a bit. But, Zayed Khan just doesn't work as a romantic hero. Every time he tries to emote a sentimental emotion, he brings a cringe. Dia Mirza is good as the confused girl who wants to do the right thing, but there is nothing special about her. Cyrus Sahukar has an effected dialogue delivery, the words don't flow. Tisca Chopra is the only one who looks competent and fit for her role, but then again this must be a cake walk for her. I usually, avoid talking about cameos, but here Shah Rukh Khan's special appearance brings about a very real, very believable reaction from Naina (Dia Mirza). It is adorable. But other than that the cameo, like most cameos, is dispensible. And that hurts because the biggest culprit in Love Breakups Zindagi's failure is the length. Had these cameos been chopped off, had a couple of side-stories been taken away, the film would be a crisper product rather than a limp one, which you are most likely to watch among many other things while flipping channels. Love Breakups Zindagi is one of those cases where rating it as ""watch if you have nothing better to do"" sounds a bit too harsh. It doesn't have laugh out loud or super-aawwww moments. But it is sweet and it does have a few relatable insights about relationships. But you have to be a very patient person to enjoy them.

There's more in the story. How I wish there was more ""to"" the story too. It's one of those cases in which even the characters' motivations are explained, you can't be made to care, because everything is just so outrageous. I mean, how can you take any film that has this scene seriously - there is ominous music when a girl tells her ex she didn't call him when there was a stressful event in her life because she had deleted his number from her mobile! And the accompanying dialogue is atrocious too. The performances are just about passable. The makeup is awful. The camerawork is basic and purely functional. The music is .. whatever...Oh well, the entire film has a more or less regressive ""whatever"" feel to it. Who are these films made for? Do such films have any takers? Really?

But the novel way in which it is recorded and narrated is engrossing. But, be warned it is not your movie if you are the kind who takes offense easily or can't handle non-escapist cinema.","You see on screen what you might read with your morning cup of coffee. Except that it's less fictitious and feels closer to reality than the paid-for articles offered by the mainstream media. (Unless of course, you rely on your twitter timeline for your daily dose of news.) Love Sex Aur Dhokha is cinema about how uncinematic life really is. Because in reality, love might not be as easy a cakewalk as narrated by YRF Films or as true either. A DDLJ-type love with due credit, a comment on our voyeuristic nature, and a sting operation make us introspect about the society we live in. Superficially, none of the three short films are exactly out of the ordinary. But there is something more than a story, director/writer Dibakar Banerjee is narrating. Yes, Rahul-Shruti's story is a spoof of happy cinema. And I had the same issued I had with it as I have with spoofy films that add nothing new but use the excuse of parody to do exactly what they are mocking at. Yeah, it also jeers at the how films are made in Bollywood - story being disregarded, etc. We've seen quite a bit of that. So, there's nothing new there. But it is also a comment on the Indian parent psyche - their priorities as guardians and a demonstration of their unconditional love. While all three stories are about our keen interest in other people's lives, Adarsh-Rashmi's story makes it loud and clear what the entire film is hinting at. Have we ever wondered how many ""bad things"" in the world would have not occurred if it were not for our boredom in our daily lives. For those of us who take pleasure in others' misfortunes, would do it only to make their lives less mundane, right? Why else would the life of a regular, not-so pretty-looking salesgirl at a dull general store interest us at all? Then there are issues that need to be exposed. Our media should be responsible for it. Some media groups take it upon themselves to reveal society's ugly face. But, how selfless are they? They bank on the same prying human nature to pick their stories. The theme of betrayal - from personal infidelity to how unfaithful media is with us - is repetitively emphasized by crossing, double-crossing, triple-crossing and more in the Prabhat-Nayna story. By the way, just one word for the entire cast - pure awesome! How can you comment on something that is made to look so regular, so ordinary that you think you can do it? Sure there is a connection between the stories in terms of characters crossing paths, but the connection seeps deep. No, the predictability of each story is not what I'm hinting at. Sure, none of the climaxes per se are shocking, but there is an all pervasive them of love, sex and dhokha (betrayal) running through the film. While one element might be over-powering than the rest in each one of them, the other two aspects are not far behind. Also common is the sort-of open-ended climaxes to all three stories. You know what actually happened, but the motivations of the characters is left to your interpretation. Interestingly, you can ask the same question of the entire superficial connection. Had the links in one story been picked up by characters from the other story, this one could have been not-so-dark.There is a fourth element in the film which is silent but you cannot shake it off - the camera. The camera is left around, almost as if its presence is pure coincidental, if not accidental. I can only imagine how much thought must have gone into making the camera-placement look so casual. That with the non-traditional lighting set a very dark tone to the film, which of course are justified by the nature of the stories. What is very traditional though, is the marketing technique deployed. The use of the word 'sex' to arouse curiosity and create an aura of sensuousness is nothing more than a publicity gimmick. Anyone going in expecting even soft-porn is going to be seriously disappointed. And Banerjee-saaheb, et tu? An item number with the closing credits? Yeah, yeah, yeah…spoof and all that jazz. Love Sex Aur Dhokha is not watchable just for you to decipher its comment on us as individuals or society. There are plenty that do that. It is not something you should go for just to see the ace-class production values. Nor is it just for seeing something different. It is one of those one-offs that are made worthy by the whole package. ""Why should such a film be made at all?"", the prude may ask. Why should any film be made at all? And the argument begins…

Are we going to do a full circle? At least, I hope by then, we'll have an ""ignore"" button lurking around somewhere that can be pressed whenever chords play together in the name of music.

I seriously don't want to make a call on Harman Baweja just yet. The Baweja family must have poured their heart into this one, but I can see only brickbats coming their way. For a story that, according to director's note at the official site, was conceived 9 years ago, the way the movie was shot felt very superficial.

Films like this need to be supported so that more such films are made and more young filmmakers feel the need to express themselves.","PVR’s initiative to release independent films is turning out to be a boon for filmmakers who find it hard to release their films in today’s day and age because of ‘lack of commercial viability’. Love, Wrinkle-free, directed by debutante Sandeep Mohan, is a film that needed to be released, because it is rare to find a film with such charm and honesty coming out of India today.
Set entirely in Goa, the film is essentially the journey of a married couple, Savio and Annie, going through what can best be described as a mid-life crisis. He wants to follow his inner calling – selling his own brand of innerwear. She wants to prove to herself and the world that she’s still good enough to be a choir singer, even though the choir would rather have younger singers. And their adopted daughter Ruth has identity issues of her own. She can’t come to terms with the fact that she has ‘small eyes’. Along the way, they meet a host of mad characters who, for want of a better word, complicate their story just a little bit more.
This little charmer of a film is driven by its characters and their journey to come to terms with their self-image. The characters are consistently quirky, and their interactions, though not always ‘haha’ funny, are laced with such belief and are so grounded in reality, that they always evoke laughter.
The film is embellished by earnest performances by the entire lead cast. Ash Chandler, playing Savio, is pitch-perfect as the perpetually hassled middle class man looking to make his family proud of him. Shernaz Patel as Annie - the slightly obsessive-compulsive woman is excellent as well. Sohrab Ardeshir as the local Goan don adds that extra madness to the proceedings. Seema Rahmani, playing a spunky tourist who strikes up a bond with Savio, is a natural. Last seen in Sudhish Kamat’s Good Night, Good Morning, she seems to slip into characters that she plays with ease.
What truly makes Love, Wrinkle-free’s  thoroughly entertaining watch is the indie spirit behind the film. There seems to be no wish to conform, no urge to tell a story with a necessary start and end. The film starts somewhere bang in the middle of the characters lives and ends somewhere in the middle as well. You can’t help feel that the story of the characters will continue even after you have walked out of the cinema hall, but the characters and their mad escapades will continue. The core of the film - the underlying theme of identity and image, of one’s looks and the concept of youth - will strike a chord with everyone.
Setting the film in Goa is another factor that adds to the flavor of the film. The attempt isn’t to show Goa the way you would to a tourist. It exists in the background, calm, serene but always there. The earthy colour tone complements the film well. 
At a time where people get away with tripe saying, 'I don't make films for critics', Love, Wrinkle-free comes as a breath of fresh air. This is the kind of film that is bound to make you smile.

That, however, in no way implies that one must gauge it any different from how one would any other film. Backed by a terrific story and a convincing lead cast, this film that looks at the blurred lines between dreams and reality, holds its own as an engaging cinematic experience. ","“Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?” – Morpheus, The Matrix (1999)The story of how Pawan Kumar’s second feature film was made has become a part of cinema lore. Failed attempts at finding a producer led to a scathing blog post from the director, which then led to him exploring crowd-funding. This culminated in the 50-lakh-odd film Lucia, shot on a Canon 5D - now the first crowd-funded Kannada film to find a theatrical release.People tend to judge an indie film differently from a ‘normal’ film, whatever that means. ‘Indie’ doesn’t necessarily equate to ‘made with heart, but of merely acceptable quality’. That’s where, say, a Ship of Theseus – or now, a Lucia – comes along and teaches you to not look at an indie film through the lens of sympathy. No matter what the budget or the circumstances under which the film was made, if you expect someone to pay to watch your film, it better be damn good. After all, the story of your film’s making doesn’t appear in the subtitles to your film. The only story that matters is the story of the film itself; and that’s where Lucia scores heavily.Nikhil, affectionately called Nikki, is a normal common man with a somewhat-normal affliction – insomnia. One of his nocturnal sojourns, however, leads him to something that starts giving him not just sleep, but sleep with dreams that he has always dreamt of seeing. Obviously, all good things come with a rider…Throughout time, dreams have always fascinated artists across media, because of just how they are always open to interpretation and how no one has still fully been able to understand dreams, despite the age of advancement we live in. Lucia takes of all of that mystery and fascination and fits it into a layered - yet largely lucid - tale of ambition, desire and destiny. Drawing slightly from the quote at the start of the review, while also tipping its hat to Christopher Nolan’s Inception, Lucia is often twisted and smart, but that can often fool a part of the audience. What truly makes it worth your time is that it has a soul; an emotional story with characters that you get involved in and whose story you almost desperately want to see the resolution of. Nikki – both ‘sides’ of him – are characters that you instantly root for, because you see where he is coming from. The same goes for the love of his life Shwetha – a woman with real, practical dreams and aspirations, irrespective of which face of her character you consider. The film is also a pointed take on one of the fundamental truths of humankind – that the grass is always greener on the other side. One always covets what the other has, never once pausing to think about how unique and special what they already have is. Lucia spends its first hour setting up a mystery that you quickly feel like getting to the bottom of – that of Nikki’s dreams. And it does so with zippy cuts and a fast-moving narrative that still never takes your attention off the story. In the second half – and this is where some are likely to have a problem with it – the film changes gears and focuses more on the characters. In fact, if you happen to unravel the mystery before it is meant to be unraveled, then you are also likely to feel a sense of been-there-seen-that. Despite this, the film largely holds up, because even if you see hints of where the story is heading, you are still curious about where the characters end up.It helps greatly that the story is backed by convincing lead performances. Sathish Neenasam, who plays Nikki, completely looks and behaves like how Nikki should, at every point in the story. The pretty Sruthi Hariharan as Shwetha is superb as well. Even when her character makes choices that you may disagree with, she still manages to convince you of where she’s coming from. I don’t have the faintest idea of whether the two of them are established names in Kannada cinema or not, but they are perfect for the characters they play in Lucia. Some of the supporting cast is shaky, but you look past them because the characters they play hold fort.On a personal note, the film is a nice little ode to cinema itself. Starting from the obvious nature of Nikki’s character (and how I’m tempted to reveal a slight spoiler here, but I won’t,) to the more subtle ways in which cinema seems to mirror real life and vice versa, Lucia can delight a true cinephile – one who sees cinema as beyond just love for and opinions about the films one sees.The true victory of Lucia is that it manages to make you gloss over its relatively technical limitations, not out of pity, but because you are so drawn into the story and the characters. It underlines the fact that at the end of the day, the script is king. The minutes (or, if you’re lucky, hours) that you spend post the film wondering whether you’re in a dream or not are an added bonus.

But there's no way to duck the god-awful dialogues. And just as ""Love isn't good enough for survival"", just style doesn't a good film make.","You aren't expecting reality when the film is titled Luck. To top it off the font chosen for the title has diamonds and the U jets out to make a horse shoe. There's still some hope that each character's life has a passable amount of luck. But almost ALL the characters have this insurmountable amount of luck except that it's not enough for them to have enough mullah. But that too has its purpose, you see. It's so that they can play the ""biggest game"". And thus starts the ""reality show"".And this is only interval. Yes, the entire first half is shot like it is setting up the characters. And the second half is shot like it is setting up the situation, the story. I just hope the idea isn't to have a sequel ""Lucky again"". But for this one it means every character, every event, every frame is stylized. It all looks very smart. But an excess of anything is bad holds true here too. It gets tiring and overbearing. It was likely, or at the very least there was a chance that this style would have worked if the film was shorter. But no such luck! (Damn! Can I please say 'No pun intended'?) The issue was that the individual episodes in the story were not predictable, though the overall story was. Not to mention the extremely cheesy and obvious one-liners which were also translated every once in a while. The voiceover in the first five minutes should be a good give away of the non-sense that is to come. Also looks like the challenge was to have the word luck or a synonym thereof in every second sentence. And unfortunately, the writer won! An action flick, a supposed thriller - you don't really expect ace acting. And that's what you get - non-ace acting. It was disheartening to see Danny play second fiddle, especially when the last I saw him was in Frozen. The rest do their usual bit. Sanjay plays a don-like role. Imraan Khan continues from Kidnap and Chitrashi Rawat from Chak De! India. Shruti Haasan plays the sex appeal and I guess, it works. Acting I can't see. Ravi Kissen is the insufferable sleazy character. Do you feel love or hatred for any of the characters? Na-a-ah! By the way, be warned this para is sort-of giving the movie away. But it is infuriating that a writer had a serial-killer character (possibly rapist) not only escape the death sentence but also be respectfully set free! (ba-izzat bari, my ....!) Seriously, the premise and the broad sub-plots are very interesting indeed. The execution isn't all bad either. But the details in terms of characterizations or dialogues are the pits. And it makes you cry for sanity. And the climax is the mother of all ridiculous climaxes. Even for a film that is far away from reality, the climax seemed completely out of place.

Clever lines amongst preachy ones. Clichéd characters yet deeper too. There's equal scope to let go and enjoy or to observe and ponder.,"I can imagine Zoya Akhtar taking notes every time she saw a person from the industry behave in a ""typical"" industry manner. She then smoothened out the edges of these rough mental sketches, deepened them ever-so-slightly, gave them a thick outline and ta-da...script ready. That's the Einstein-moment when she realized she needed a story. Damn! Back to the storyboard to weave all these characters together into a coherent plot. If it were left to her, she'd have been very happy to just continue playing around with her characters and their peculiarities for a couple more hours without ever getting to their story. And she'd have done well too.That's not to say that she didn't do justice to the story, it's just that it had nothing spectacular about it - a love story with gray characters most of whom are ambitious. And she does tweak the simple storyline a bit too. And those tweaks might not make the movie very popular but I enjoyed them the best. The foreground of Mumbai's filmy world has all the clichéd elements any movie based on the industry could be expected to have. And yet there's charm in all its characters. Rishi Kapoor is the industry stalwart and yet has his share of insecurities. Dimple Kapadia, a Diva in her era hasn't had enough fame and is intent upon continuing to live her aspirations through her daughter. Isha playing the daughter is almost clueless but knows her way around too.  Juhi Chawla's character enjoys her status in this world even if it is mostly in the name of a trophy-wife. All these ""stars"" in real life mixed with Manish Malhotra, Mac Mohan, Javed Akhtar, Shabana Azmi, Kareena Kapoor, Vivek Oberoi, Ranbir Kapoor, John Abraham, Abhishek Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan playing themselves. Anurag Kashyap aces the list, I couldn't resist giggling throughout his two scenes. Don't let this list bring back bad memories from Om Shanti Om though. Even if their cameos are to multiply the glamour quotient, there's a reason for them to be smartly woven in the movie and it's not just to shake a leg or two. This smartness runs as an undercurrent through the movie. It starts off with one of the very few non-Khans at the 'top' in the industry, Hrithik Roshan being named Zaffar Khan. Then we see him discussing a break from the mould he is set in as an actor...so he can work with Karan Johar. Farhan Akhtar's character, Vikram has been written with great thought too. The transitions he goes through are not perfunctory or a result of an inspirational one-liner. But, you can see the build-up towards the change. We see him get vulnerable-emotional and conniving-calculative. The credit goes as much to his growing talent as an actor as it goes to the way his character is written. On the other hand, I feel a little bad for Konkona Sen Sharma. Since she almost always picks well-written roles, this one seems like yet-another-well-written character. So even though she performs well and gets the nuances across it feels like 'What's the big deal? We know she can do that.'Yet in this medley of little good things there are stretches of ""got it, let's move on already!"" There are spans which have absolutely inane-quotes-from-an-email-forward dialogues. I suppose they are meant to inspire. But such lines almost always end up patronizing in a very annoying sort-of a way. The saving grace is that they are amidst some witty one-liners. Luck By Chance is the kind you can sit back and enjoy. And at the same time it keeps your gray cells at work. Not because of a powerful plot or any such thing. But more because the characters are thinking and talk like people do. So by any chance, if you miss it in the theaters make sure you catch it on DVD...only when it is officially out though ;)

Nothing memorable for later. ,"Lucknow Central keeps you more or less engaged with its performances and pulsating ambiance of thrill. But if you disconnect, you might even squeeze in a snooze because of its slack pace.Wrongly imprisoned protagonist, crushed aspirations, vicious inmate who wants to show his power, even more intimidating jailer who is out to get the protagonist, a wish to escape it all, a sympathising well-wisher – the usual tropes of a “prison” film are all present in Lucknow Central. What you are looking forward to then is something different in what links these predictable aspects together. While the first half  is full of what you would expect, the only variety from other “prison” films is the intensity and type of torture of fist-fights between inmates. The second half brings in some edge-of-the-seat moments leading to one of the two possible climaxes, making the end largely predictable.That leaves you with the performances. Surprisingly, you aren't able to shrug off the feeling that Kishan, the lead character is Farhan Akhtar. Only well into the second half, are a couple of scenes he blends into the milieu. In fact, it is the side character who make the atmosphere believable. Even though Ronit Roy's characters are almost always bad news, as the jailer of Lucknow Central, he sends a chill down the spine every time he appears on screen. His stand-offs against Ravi Kishan are entertaining and yet seem real. Other than a couple of those and a few moments of thrill though, Lucknow Central seems like yet another “prison” film. In fact, the story is quite similar to the other one a few weeks ago, Qaidi Band Review. Thankfully it loses the tone of propaganda. Yet, it stays only moderately engaging.

Treated like pulpy fun, however, and propelled by Scarlett Johansson's electrifying presence, the film spends more time on the thrills, than on some interesting questions that it poses.","The name Lucy might conjure black-and-white images of bubbly naiveté for some, but any lingering subconscious connections you might have made to a popular 50s American sitcom disappear quite quickly, once Luc Besson's latest film begins.A spunky Scarlett Johansson in the title role almost immediately gets drawn into a violent series of events that lead to her being involuntarily administered a synthetic drug; except, the drug has an effect that one couldn't have ever imagined.The film has an interesting premise - the fact that the human mind is known to utilize only 10% of its capacity. What would happen if, somehow, it was able to optimize and use every bit of it? The result - the film would have you believe - is mind-boggling.There's no denying that the pace of the film - always brisk - and Johansson's performance, keep you interested at all times. Things often get out of hand in terms of believability, and some of the VFX in the film are unacceptably tacky. Yet, it is that intriguing premise that holds the film together. As Lucy begins to use more and more of her mind capacity, you're always curious about just where all of it will lead.Interestingly, Besson, who has also written and edited the film, clearly wants you to use more and more of your mind as the film progresses, just the way Lucy does. In the initial scenes, he cuts away to wildlife shots in the middle of the scene - to almost spoonfeed the audience about what exactly is going on. As the film makes its way to the business end, the explanatory cutaways cease, and the pace of cutting increases rapidly, making you concentrate harder. Along the way, the film poses some truly interesting questions about human perception and our understanding of existence itself. It attempts to put forth a theory about humanity's existential crisis. Yet, the film never quite rises over being just pulpy sci-fi. There are thrills to be had along the way, particularly in one deft car chase scene, (supposedly) through the streets of Paris. Johansson is terrific, which goes without saying. Not just because of her screen presence, but because she tempers her performance with subtle shifts that progress through the film. Morgan Freeman plays an elderly scientist and the only one who can understand what Lucy is going through - which basically means he plays Morgan Freeman. Lucy is fun while it lasts, and if you choose to take the philosophical questions that it poses back home with you, then you could spend some time tossing and turning them over in your head, to draw your own conclusions. But somehow, it never quite seems like that was Luc Besson's intention with this film.

What is companionship? What is attraction?","After a certain stage in a relationship, most likely, there is comfort or stagnancy. In either case, you need an extra spark, something to look forward to. The apprehension; the spring in the step; the glint in the eye that a new relationship brings - that's what The Lunchbox is about. And more. Like any other relationship, Ila-Fernandes relationship is as much about the two individuals as it is about the relationship itself. Sure, the chemistry builds up beautifully, without one setting an eye on the other. But, their personal insecurities, frustrations is what makes The Lunchbox stand apart from most other films.Moreover, the whole package is breathtakingly simple. The one-line plot, the characters, the ambiance, the situations, the humor would make even the most city-bred in the audience believe that a middle-class world like this exists, as much as it ever did, even today. The one-liner ""what if"" - what if the well-known lunchbox system went wrong one day and put two lonely souls in touch with each other? How fascinating an idea! Of the thousands of possibilities, the one writer/director Ritesh Batra picks is as charmingly old-school as it gets. The characters he picks to put together are mere faces in the crowd of 20 million. Ordinary, uninteresting - most likely, you and me. The side characters, including the neighbor oldie (Bharti Achrekar) you don't see, are given quirks that are thoroughly enjoyable, even if not real. You don't root for any of the characters, you just play along and are willing to go wherever the story takes you. There is no arc. There is no significant peak in the story. The simple progress of conversations between Ila and Fernandez is enough to keep you going. Each one is special; just like each conversation of a budding relationship is dear. Yet, none of it, not a thing would've been acceptable if it weren't for Irrfan Khan and Nimrat Kaur. Let alone the slightest show of spark or disappointment in their eyes, the variation in the tone for their voice-overs is enough to inspire awe. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is a charmer as always. The most obvious character in the film is one I am biased towards - Mumbai. Any film that reminds me of the sights, the smells, the energy of that city has won me over in the first scene. In complete contrast to this buzzing city is, ever so slow-paced, The Lunchbox. A beautiful contrast which could get to you if you are waiting for something to happen. So, depending on your make and what you seek in your films, the climax can be exhilarating or underwhelming. I was bang in between, even though I cannot see a more fitting end to the film. That's what will make or break the film for you.

A warm Punjabi family, subtle humor, a little romance, a little suspense, and a predictable base plot. Fine performances and some fresh, earthy dialogue keep the momentum and interest in this otherwise plain plot.  ","From the earth of Punjab come people who are charmingly simple because they are open-hearted and uninhibited. We know this because of the unrepressed dialogue given to these Punjabis. Punjabis who for a change don't shout and are not dressed in loud silks. Yet, you cannot escape the lack of depth in the basic plot. I guess you can't get it all. You know the protagonist Omi (Kunal Kapoor) is going to end up looking for a secret ingredient in his grandfather's recipe. After seeing the trailers, the main reasons that bring you to the theater are - to find out not what happens but how it happens and to see that 10% deviation from your prediction of what it is going to be. You can't but resist the hope that at least something will be different because of the name Anurag Kashyap associated with it, right?Unfortunately, you wait and wait for it to happen, but it doesn't come. That small twist or that extra conflict over what has been exposed in the trailer or that 'ah-ha' moment that the film is nicely and lovingly building up towards - but it just doesn't come. It teases you every once in a while with the protagonist, Omi (Kunal Kapoor) considering to behave according to what his character is made out to be, but ultimately, you are only teased. And as with many, many films, the end is a little contrived and convenient.Fortunately though, warm performances by every member of the cast, the dialogue they are given, Amit Trivedi's music and the rugged, dusty ambiance created are the four strong pillars that Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana stands on. The chemistry between various combinations of characters is charming and the brewing romance has its own flavor of cute. From the twinkle in grandpa's eyes when he first sees Omi after 10 years to the tune the title music breaks into halfway to the dust on the walls of the houses to a lot of things in between - everything works in adding value to the experience of watching a story.However, a predictable basic plot is a predictable basic plot and can only provide only so much of a firm foundation however strong the pillars. This once, my belief that if the how you get to the end of a story is done well, the what you find there doesn't matter as much has been proven slightly wrong. For whatever Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana has achieved is because of the ""how""s going right. If only, a little of this ""how"" was also about some meat in the story part of the writing. Also, ever since the missing ingredient is revealed, I had this nagging feeling of having seen this before or read it somewhere. An internet search hasn't brought much to light except that the concept of a missing ingredient/recipe has been looked for umpteen number of times, which we always knew. But the sense of 'tune that haunts you because you can't think of the words' just won't leave me. Hopefully, it'll come soon.

And that's its charm. ,"A biopic usually chooses to paint a larger-than-life picture – and it would be justified because hey, the person has achieved enough for a biopic to be made on his life. A biopic usually elaborates the well-known, key moments of success. A biopic rarely goes beyond what newspaper headlines cover. M S Dhoni – The Untold Story does none of the above. It chooses to impress with details of a more than humble beginning. It chooses to inspire rather than merely awe. The pace is slow. At 185 minutes, the film is long. A person waiting for the scoop on Dhoni's controversial decisions will have to wait longer. Of course, they promised us things we didn't already know. And a lot of the first half's charm comes from those little details. In fact, the makers might have taken advantage of the reverence his fans have for him. Had this been a fictional story, the details might or might not have been as interesting. We'll never know. But as it stands, the film is cute, refreshing, surprising and inspiring. Not only because Dhoni had to fight a lot of odds. He did so with humility and gratitude. It almost feels like Dhoni chose this medium to thank the people who helped him reach where he is now and told the filmmakers only about those situations and moments.  The writers also give us these philosophies that he had, developed and lived by. Unfortunately though, we are not made privy to his strategy, his thought process. They even tease the audience with an instance of how he took his teammates in confidence but they never tell us exactly what he thought or said. That I was looking forward to and sorely missed. That Mahi bites his nails, is afraid of commitment, wants to please his father, is a prankster, gets frustated – make him human – like you and me. These tidbits keep him from becoming a superhero and instead show his level-headedness. Ok, I will stop myself from making this into an essay on Mahendra Singh Dhoni. One last thing - I loved the romantic flirt in him. Not to mention, the couple of romantic scenes in the film do much more than feature length romantic films. Of course, if it were not for Sushant Singh's cutesy boy-ness, these scenes might not have worked. Otherwise too, he carries the character and the film well, never once seeming unconvincing. However, there are quite a few things that kept me from enjoying the movie more than I did. The background music. The occasional use of slow-motion and other dramatic elements. Sure these elements worked to bring a smile. Of course, a reaction shot of a non-believer of Mahi's shot is bound to bring a smile. I digress again. There was a slack in pace at the beginning of many sequences. There is attention to detail and there is detail. You can appreciate the simplicity of the clothes that Mahi's family wears, the pains taken to show a true-blue middle-class household, the characters that make small-town India and so on. The movie fills you with warmth for the hard-working, dedicated working class of India. But the movie also begins to annoy with too much detail. The audience enters almost every scene a little too early. Way too many scenes have a character enter a room, open a door, sit, exchange pleasantries and so on. Precious screen time spent on setting the mood, and it doesn't really  happen. But hey, for a person who likes to watch test matches more than a T-20, it was worth the wait for me. And yet, when the second half picks pace it sorely lacks detail. 35 years isn't a very long life. However, when you have achieved a lot in those 35 years, it can warrant a film. When one sets out to make that film, they have lots to pick from. Biopics could be interesting or not depending on what was left out. M S Dhoni – The Untold Story picks a lot of lovely details from before the man's rise to success and stardom. However, life after success is skimmed through in a rush.Maybe it is intentional, metaphorical even. The struggle was long. The success, once it came, happened all too quickly. Or maybe the last 8-10 years are too “current”; a little risky to have the details open for public scrutiny. Maybe it is an opening for an untold story - Part 2, when this will all be history. Yes, I am a fan and I can't have enough. Till then though, we can bank on Bollywood to deliver the predictable. And this once we are thankful. You know how this specific biopic is going to begin. In fact, you want it to begin and end so, and no other way. And yet you have goosebumps when you watch it. That is the power of your fandom and your love for the game. The makers would have to really mess it up to take that away from you. They don't.

Rejecting the offer, the protagonist comes to a coffee shop from where the story kicks off. At the end of the 2-hour long movie, the movie felt like it had great potential to be the decade’s best unintentional comedy, had the filmmaker went on to make the film with that aide. The director of Maalai Pozhudhin Mayakathilaey would have spared us from the insipid tale of romance. Sometimes we make few decisions based on certain information. Many a times, they backfire; one such being my decision to watch Maalai Pozhudhin Mayakathilaey. I could go on blotting this page with negativity about the movie but I didn’t choose this film to do precisely that. There were concrete reasons that drew me to the silver screen. The symphony of the scintillating tracks by Achu & textbook beauty shoots of Gopi that looked glamorous in the teasers did appease the peeved mind. Though they occupy a fourth of the time space, song sequences alone can never make a poorly made film tolerable. Maalai Pozhudhin Mayakathilaey is another example that unique concept alone can never carry a film to the podium; in this case not even to the cafeteria of the stadium.

As if it wasn’t trauma enough to see Om Puri perform like a monkey in movies like Buddha Mar Gaya and Mere Baap Pehle Aap now we have to suffer the heart-break of Kay Kay Menon and Rahul Bose being loud and over-the-top, and shamelessly so. How much more torture is this industry capable of?The thing is that they were not bad performances considering the wisdom that slapsticky performances are supposed to be this way. But, I really wish we were not exposed to this versatility that they are capable of. True, Rahul Bose isn’t the greatest performer around, but Kay Kay….Just because I had great regard for the script choices that these two make, I was giving the many Mallika Sherawat sleazy dance numbers and scenes a benefit of doubt. Thinking, maybe the script really demands it. Till, I was proved wrong by Mallika trying to seduce the audience with a straight look in the camera rather than sharing chemistry with her co-stars.Under the pretext of being a satirical comment on the prevalence of slapstick in Hindi cinema, Maan Gaye Mughal-E-Azam ends up adding one more to the “crappy movies” list. It starts out trying to be sarcastic about the dismal political and administrative condition of this country. But satisfies itself with just scratching the surface. There is no intention of delving any deeper or ruffling any feathers.And what was all the mockery of Urdu, Mughal-e-azam, Jaane bhi do yaaro for? As far as I know, mockery is done by someone who thinks they are superior to the things they are ridiculing. Now really? Can anyone have such an inflated opinion of themselves? Especially when they are involved with a product like this?While I go balm my hurt, cinema-crazy soul, and in general, get over what I just went through, I seriously hope you were saved from having to bear this.

41,741,741,741,741,Machine Gun Preacher,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review,/movie/machine-gun-preacher-review/,,,,4.5,"In Machine Gun Preacher, everything happens too easily. We aren’t given time to digest a psycho Gerard Butler rechristening himself as a savior of the Sudenese Orphans. We aren’t given enough time to attach ourselves to the happenings in the film – and it’s not because this is a fast- paced film. Screenwriter Jason Keller and director Marc Forster (Monster Ball and Quantum of Solace) make a conscious effort to not pass a judgment with the film but it lacks in its basic convincing powers. ","There’s nothing like a movie that jolts you out of your groove. A story about a man who is everything evil, who mends his ways because there’s too much wrong in the world anyway. Throw in a religious revelation and a testosterone-spewing conflict filled journey and you’ll have a “gripping” drama. Fortunately for Machine Gun Preacher everything seems like it’s on the right track – Gerard Butler , a post-colonialist debate, a character graph and a title that seems like it’s been leaked from a graphic novel.Machine Gun Preacher is based on the real life story of Sam Childers (played by Gerard Butler  in the film) who starts off as a violent, ex-con with a heavy dependency on alcohol and drugs. He and his similarly placed pal Donnie (Michael Shannon) are a couple of pit stops away from hell, you are told. Before you can swallow, Butler  manages to turn his ways as he discovers Christianity. The good thing is Forster doesn’t expect you to share the same beliefs. He decides he must relocate to Africa for missionary work, after building a (clean) successful construction business. While Butler  is blue-collaring up, Uganda and Sudan call out to him much like a prayer. Forgive my tone, but it's the exact same feeling one gets while watching the film. The film barely takes any time to establish his sudden transformation to a nice guy, let alone a really nice guy with a soul. It slowly then, transcends into an unbelievable film, and a story that isn’t narrated very well. A quick note about the scenes in Uganda and Sudan: the visual description is heart-wrenching. Through the course of the film he becomes sort of a holy warrior for the Sudanese orphans, saving them from the internal system. There, Machine Gun Preacher gets a bunch of brownie points, for making the audience want to consider leaving their own cushioned lives for the betterment of the world. Or at least feel horrible about being privileged. Gerard Butler  gives a stimulating performance, but a confusing one. He’s tough, alright. You’re afraid of him when he’s a violent no-gooder and you want to applaud him for having the nerve to uproot his life – but you cannot, for the life of you, move beyond how he reaches to such situations.I’ve not read the book that this movie is based on (Childers’ memoir Another Man’s War) but the film adaption is just too easy. It waters down every other effort that the film makes to create, a visually gripping account of what happens when an eccentric character enters a world that is blocked out.The biggest flaw though, is in Machine Gun Preacher fundamentally conveying through the film that it takes a White American man, in all his power to kill in the name of god, so the “oppressed” can see a better life. That is if we get down to analyzing the message of the film. Marc Forster  ceases to bend towards a judgment but you can see it in Butler’s demeanor. The film leaves a lot unsaid, and this is a thought that might be considered unnecessary. My question is – couldn’t we have done without the politics? Butler needn’t have had to move from a psychopath to a half-saint. He could have been a regular guy with a genuine will to help – somehow, in the film you can’t decipher if he’s helping or assuming a high role of power to massage his own ego. You could watch the film for Butler’s performance – just don’t attempt to answer the question marks in your head.

42,742,742,742,742,[The] Machinist,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/machinist-review/,,,,4.5,"If you’ve been up all night, you know the crazy things insomnia can make a person do. At several points during The Machinist, you will promise yourself never to deliberately stay up and let your demons take over. Christian Bale’s underweight, sleep-deprived look is so disturbing, it compels you to sit through the movie to figure out what happens. Watch the film for a good old dose of wide-eyes-shock-revelation-relief. ","It’s scary when you’ve seen a fit and bordering-chubby actor in films like American Psychoand Nolan’s BatmanSeries turn into a frail, 6’3 - 110 pounds man for a character. Apart from the sincerity and dedication, Christian Bale’s look in The Machinistjust creeps you out. In the film, he plays a man who hasn’t slept in a year and hence loses copious amounts of weight, and everytime you see his ribcage or protruding spine you just want to leap into the screen, feed him some food and sing him a lullaby to sleep. The Machinistis a thriller alright. Trevor Reznik works as a machinist, a fairly laborious job which should want him to have a good night’s sleep. Yet his insomnia brings him to a nightmarish state, where he repeatedly has flashback visions, everything around him is woozy and uncontrollable. He believes a co-worker who doesn’t exist is harassing him, he gets sucked into a warped game of hangman, which haunts him at several points, and he finds solace in 2 women with dual personalities - a sex-worker who becomes his confidante and a dedicated mother and a waitress, who allows him to escape his world through their conversations. Both women overlap each other, yet they stand apart bringing to the table different emotions for him to explore. The concoctions used in The Machinistare the standard ones. A troubled protagonist, undergoing physical and psychological trauma that leads to furthering of the plot, a dark, largely black/white tone of the film and an ascending Hitchcock-esque wailing piano background music. You know his lack of sleep is making Reznik see things, yet you want to know if someone is conspiring against him, as he believes. You will find yourself arguing that all of this could be a hallucination, but you don’t want to seem presumptuous – hence you sit with your bitten nails waiting to see what finally happens. Although no ground-breaking secrets are revealed at the end of the film – it’s actually a very typical climax for it’s genre - you still make that journey as a viewer with the film where you feel like the story has met it’s end. You know because Reznik has found his closure, you can sit back and feel the same. The Machinistis one of those few films where you get attached to character not because you particularly like him, or because you are sympathetic of him – it’s just a brilliant job of characterization. You immediately feel drawn to his story.The DVD has an audio commentary from the director Brad Anderson, which helps deconstruct the film and is much better than having a rambling account of the shoot and set. The only problem is, he spoils the endings of films like Fight Club andThe Sixth Sense, so if you haven’t seen those, skip the commentary. There are also a few deleted scenes and theatrical trailers in the special features section, which is intriguing – they reveal that the film is shot in Spain. Bale’s look in the film would qualify as the creepiest aspect, among other things in the film. You’d be interested in knowing that 3 months after the shoot of this film, he shot for Batman Begins. The Machinistis out and out a Christian Bale film; it’s about his character, his look and the creepy stuff that happens to you if you don’t sleep. Take your mother’s advice, go to sleep before someone makes a movie about your insomnia.

As a poke to social conscience, can movies do more than poke?","Madaari has just the right amount of “thriller” moments that make you wonder what will happen next – will the kidnapper's plan work out? What is the investigation team going to do next? However, that is not Madaari's sole aim. While holding your interest, Madaari clearly has another agenda. The trailer, the promotional material, the tag line, “shhh...desh so raha hai” (quiet, the country is sleeping) all couldn't be more obvious in telling you about its motive – to talk about the state of corruption in the country. It fumbles here, it falters there, but it works. As a message film, Madaari works as much as a movie can work as a nudge to collective social conscience. No action is really expected from you after you are out of the theater. It will take something much stronger than a movie for that to happen. Meanwhile though, Madaari makes you smirk at the rot in the society because it is uncommon to see on screen what we have gotten used to seeing off it. It makes you nod your head in agreement at situations that characters find themselves in. It even makes us clap at some wonderfully written lines. Lines that are witty, insightful and unexpected all at once – yet they are not “filmy”. They are lines that real-life smart alecs, sharp people, sarcastic people, frustrated people would say when caught in the said situation. The writing shines in the story too. Madaari stays engaging, despite its slow pace, mainly because it is not a one-sided game. Both sides – the kidnapper (Irrfan Khan) and the task force head (Jimmy Sheirgill) are using their wits to make the next move. To that, you add the dilemma – isn't the kidnapper making sense? Isn't his agenda our agenda (in real life)? But is it right to kidnap, whatever your reason? Not to mention that the politician whose son has been abducted is not necessarily all black, even though a lot of his real life choices are politically motivated. 
Of course, you couldn't be so involved if it were not for actors like Irrfan Khan and Jimmy Sheirgill leading the affair. While we expect nothing less from Irrfan Khan, Jimmy Sheirgill has subtle reactions to what he hears/sees that are not to be missed. There is no dilemma in his mind, and yet you can see the surprise in his eyes and body language that says, “touché”. It is good to see that variation, when he seems to be the go to person to play a task force head for impossible tasks. Vishesh Bansal, the kidnapped kid, is rather functional, but that too had its charm. It is always tiring to see a child actor speaking like an adult. In fact, there are times in movies with a social message make you wish even adults didn't speak like adults. Madaari doesn't have too much of it but it does fall into the preachy category towards the end, in a very, “you can't handle the truth” manner. That aside, use of daydreams is another element that was quiet annoying. It's alright for the first couple of times because they are small sections. But playing with the audience using longer sequences of such gimmickry is almost like cheating, like saying it out loud that they aren't confident of the real drama, the real story. Also, it breaks the rhythm of the film. Though the pace of the film slackens because there is nothing new happening in one section of the film, it had a tone. This tone becomes uneven and distracting. However, these aren't bad enough to take away from the slick editing, the slight non-linearity in the timeline. Along with the camerawork and the music, the flow of the film add to the thriller element of the film. These bits alone are enough for me to watch the film again. Yes, despite the things that are disappointing. For the social angle, I just might have the kids watch it with me.

It has memorable music, a very handsome Dilip Kumar and a plot that inspired so many other apologies and successes in Bollywood. You must watch where they all learned it from.","You know you’re in for a treat when you see the title credits roll for Bimal Roy’s Madhumati. There’s Roy, the director; Ritwik Ghatak, the story writer; Hrishikesh Mukherjee, the editor; and Salil Chowdhury, the music director. On paper, it is one of the most lethal combination of Bengali biggies in a solitary film.The film is perhaps the first Indian film to deal with the theme of re-incarnation in a romantic setting. I’m not surprised. It’s a very Hinduvian love story - timeless love after all, is meant to last through seven births, when solemnized through marriage. After 50 years this film is a classic is because despite many films exploring the theme (Karz, Karan Arjun, Hamesha, Om Shanti Om), the story still seems convincing, with a fair amount of leap of faith. I truly believe that most well-made films are those that are difficult to spoof, and I’d consider Madhumati as one amongst them. 
If you’re from the post 1970s generation as I am, the film’s progress makes you go through a particular cycle of emotions. It begins with admiration - at the extremely handsome Anand (Dilip Kumar), whose mannerisms and charm are complimented by the beautiful hillside locales where Madhumati is set. You then proceed to respect - at the detailed characterisation, not just for the leading starcast, but also for the supporting cast. There’s Anand whose skills as a painter are well-intentioned, later coming in handy not just to woo his lover, but also at the climax of the film. Ugranarayan (Pran), the owner of a timber estate where Anand is employed appears as if he was born to be despised. And there’s the beautiful village belle Madhumati (Vyjayanthimala) whose beauty is almost one with the scenic hills. (In addition to the scriptwriters, I’d give much credit to Lata Mangeshkar for Madhumati’s characterisation. 'Aaja re...pardesi' is the ultimate paean beckoning a lover.) Ghatak’s setting of the film seems just right, and his description of the village, its people and their history, has enough intrigue in it to let you know that, while the hills may appear beautiful on the outside, all’s not well when you probe deeper. It’s exactly the friction one needs for the love story to unfold and that’s where Ugranarayan plays villian. Your respect for the film, is followed by awe - towards Ghatak and Roy - for pulling off the first film about re-incarnation, in the history of Indian cinema. Although mythology and religion are deeply rooted in Indian culture, it must have been challenging for the film-makers to produce this on a commercial scale. It is however, the biggest commercial success of all of Roy’s films - his other films have a deep social fibre running through them e.g 
Do Bigha Zameen (highly socialistic), Parakh (satire, democracy), Sujata (untouchability) and Parineeta, Devdas (class divide). Thankfully, by the time the film ends, you’re sure that despite some Red Chillies making an Om Shanti Om out of it, it is Madhumati which has more soul to it. “They can beat you up, they can torture your body, but they cannot touch your soul,” seems true. I cannot explain enough how important a role the film’s music plays in the film. This is Salil Chowdhury’s best work. 'Suhaana safar aur yeh mausam haseen' (Mukesh), 'Zulmi sang ankh ladi' (Lata Mangeshkar), 'Chadh gayo papi bichua' (Lata Mangeshkar, Manna Dey), 'Jungle mein mor naacha' (Mukhesh) and 'Aaja re pardesi' (Lata Mangeshkar) are not just timeless classics, but they play an invaluable role in heightening the film’s commercial and aesthetic sensibilities. 'Aaja re pardesi' for example, is more haunting than the sound of creaking doors, hooting owls and repetitive shots of the full moon going under the  clouds - each of which have become clichés of films that have an element of spook in them. Madhumati deftly combines the concept of timeless romance, re-incarnation, class discrimination and feudalism in producing something that stays long with you after the film is over. It is a film that so proudly sits on the fence of being a romance, a tragedy and ghost story, a feat rarely achieved. I watched the film on the newly launched Poster Series by Shemaroo. It’s a fabulous concept, where you get the replica of the original film poster, free along with the DVD pack that has the digitally mastered version of the original film. I wish there would be more DVDs like these.

","After two weeks of typical masala fare, anything ""different"" is more than welcome. And that's exactly what Madras Cafe is - different - something that hasn't been tried too often in India; a real-life incident from recent history fictionalised but put forth with as much realism as is possible; the politics behind the incident is deciphered to some extent. For that I admire the makers for investing the time, money and talent in this project. Yet, ultimately as a film, Madras Cafe's narration seemed like I was narrating a horrifying news item to my kids - simplified; episodic; brought down to their level; without getting into too much detail yet pointing out the necessary elements. In its treatment, Madras Cafe reminds you of the numerous political thrillers from Hollywood which are very well-executed even if pulsing with drama. It keeps you engaged, has a texture that it maintains beautifully throughout the film, and of course, has its share of loopholes. It assumes a high regard for a certain position - in this case, it substitutes the President of the United States of America with the ex-Prime Minister of India. His importance and stake in the scheme of things is a given.There are a few other things that worked against the drama though. For example, at the very outset you know the outcome of the film. There is nothing to look forward to in terms of turn of events, there is nothing to hope against hope for. I couldn't help but wonder what if the film hadn't opened with Vikram's (John Abraham) take on things. I wonder if the build up to the same event would've been different, I wonder if there would've  been a better connect with the characters.Here you have someone you know nothing about in remorse about some deadly political event he was a part of. You are given a bit of his backstory but other than that you have nothing than your nationalism to connect to the happenings. The moment Jaya (Nargis Fakhri) makes a pretentious comment about anti-nationalism, you disconnect from her. And this is one of her first few lines in the film. Not that she has much to do later in the film, yet I was constantly looking for some way to be more involved. The first half of the film is narrated with fervor and is completely engrossing. The many events and characters keep you on your toes. The brief background of the situation that was steaming in Sri Lanka and the ethnic war was perfect both as a quick revision to those of us who knew of it and an introduction to those who didn't. Like I mentioned earlier, motivations and implications are explained efficiently. You are taken aback by the realism when you realise how overt a covert operation really is. It's not difficult to believe that that's how things must be in real life. So real that you forget it is John Abraham playing the role of secret agent, Vikram. This is by far his best performance. In addition, once you've walked out of the theater, you have to marvel at his gutsy decision of producing a film of this nature - this film is as devoid of masala as it gets.I am sure, the film had a number of things that aren't authentic but the dangerous situations in which our agents operate just glares at you. At the same time, you wonder if one agent's life is really considered precious enough for the entire R&AW to put its men at stake.Moreover, later, the pace slackens off in the second half where Madras Cafe tries to delve into the emotions of the people who you aren't connected with. I don't have so much of a problem with slow-paced films as I have with inconsistency in the pace. It's like you have to apply a sudden brake when you are driving at top speed. For example, while you have a person kidnapped and released within five minutes, the methodology of decoding hidden messages is painstakingly and childishly described later in the film. Also, Madras Cafe tries to bring in the sentiments of the terrorists a little too late in the film, especially considering the film is very clear about where it stands on the issue. A one-liner takeaway at the end of the film only amplifies the fact that not enough time was spent on the other side. I think it is brilliant that a filmmaker/writer picks a side and sticks to it. Then, why the need to show the other side?On the other hand, I loved the other contrast that director Shoojit Sircar brings out. Every once in a while, in this place full of violence and turmoil you see a peaceful monk walk through as if he were in a monastery. Also, the contrast of the monstrosity of the terrorists/rebels agains the beautiful landscapes of Sri Lanka are captured beautifully by cinematographer Kamaljeet Negi. So, here we are, some things brilliant, others not so much. A film that insists on not naming names but is about the events that build up to the assassination of an ex-Prime minister of India in 1991 and not to mention releases in the week of Rajiv Gandhi's birthday. Nevertheless, a film I'm glad was made, even if there were things I didn't quite like. A film which I hope you will watch, even if you don't rush to the theaters. A film that makes me wonder about its timing, given the current political climate of the country.

Not substance-less but you can tell that wasn't the focus.,"Main Aur Charles is stylish. Charles is suave. He is also supposedly a charming seducer – so you are told, not shown. The film builds an air about the character Charles Sobhraj (Randeep Hooda), but leaves it at that and doesn't get into the details. His overwhelming effect is shown, but the cause is to be assumed. For example, a criminal psychologist interviews Charles Sobhraj and she comes out rather impressed. How did he do it? Well, this movie won't tell you. The only vague attempt is made through Meera (Richa Chadda) when she talks about how she feels about him. However, she backs out and steps in too haphazardly to make sense. The performances though are the kind that keep you with the film. You want to smack the smirk off Randeep Hooda's face and that is his achievement. However, Richa Chadda isn't too convincing as Charles' dreamy-eyed lover. Adil Hussain though brings balance to the lop-sided view of Charles Sobhraj. He firmly represents a voice from the audience that says, “why is this murderer being romanticized?”The entire film is made to give that aura to the character, begging you to be seduced by him, by overcome by his slithery charm. The sepia tone, the accent, the Bond/Don-esque theme music all work towards that. There were a few distractions in terms of authenticity of the era – for example, a scene from the 80s is interspersed with a shot of a newspaper dated 1965. The clothes in Goa, especially those being sold by street vendors, looked very similar to the ones I saw in my recent trip to Goa. But hey, for all I know, fashion might have has done a full circle. All of which would have been totally ignored, were I engrossed in the story being told. They are stylish snippets that have little detail in the telling. Yet again, we have a film based on a real life personality that doesn't tell us much more about the personality than what we new from newspapers or a quick Internet search.

49,749,749,749,749,Main Aur Mrs Khanna,Watch when on TV/online,wogma reviewNotepad36 Critic Reviews 0.4/5.0 2 Reader Reviews 1/5.0,/movie/main-aur-mrs-khanna-review/,0.4/5.0,1/5.0,,2.4,"The promos of Main aur Mrs. Khanna are quite misleading as they would have you believe that this movie is a Salman Khan movie.  For all the Salman Khan fans out there, THIS IS NOT A SALMAN KHAN MOVIE. But if you want to see him anyway, go right ahead and watch it. Watch out for Bappi Lahiri.","So when a guileless Salman Khan worshipper like myself, gets ready at 8 in the morning,(and mind you, GETS READY and not just WAKES UP), to go for the latest Salman Khan movie, the least she (or in some cases, he) can expect is for that movie to be a Salman Khan movie, right? Wrong. Apparently, nowadays, it’s okay to lead the audience on. You can show them something and not deliver. So when you project Main aur Mrs. Khanna as a Salman Khan starrer, you can get away with ensuring that the Khan with an attitude makes a single appearance on either side of the interval. Main aur Mrs. Khanna, to say the least, is the work of an extremely confused filmmaker. Perhaps, Prem Soni, the director, screenplay, story, and dialogue writer (phew!) of this movie, started off with a fair idea of what he wanted to show, but somewhere in the middle, just lost it. What could otherwise have been a pretty good movie turned into a so-so fare by the average treatment meted out to it. The plot is interesting but it is let down by a loose screenplay. Also, a film like Main aur Mrs. Khanna could have done with a lot more drama in it. The main flaw, however, in Main aur Mrs. Khanna lies in characterization. The characters, especially the lead characters, are not etched definitively. If you were to define a singular character in the movie in just about one word, you wouldn’t be able to do so. For that matter, even if you were given as many words you liked, you still wouldn’t be able to do so. Primarily because right till the end of the movie, you have no idea WHO these people are. Sure you know their names, you know their profession. But the connect that a viewer has with a character, is sorely missed. We don’t feel for Kareena when she cries, nor do we laugh when she laughs. This movie commits the cardinal sin of being just something that we are watching on the big screen – it forms no relation with its audience.  The first half is slightly flat but the tempo picks up a little in the second half. In fact, the second half can squeeze quite a few laughs out of you. Just when you think that the movie might just start living up to your expectations, the plot falls flat again. The end is, in fact, very patchy and some details in the end are just plain unnecessary. Another sphere where the movie lacks is the chemistry between the lead pair. A movie that is trying to put across a message about love and relationships simply cannot do without absolutely sizzling chemistry between the lead (or so the promos say) couple. The missing chemistry, however, is not the actors’ fault it is more the director and story/screenplay writer’s fault. He just hasn’t etched characters strong enough to portray any sort of relationship. The look of the movie otherwise is good. The locales are good, as is Kareena’s styling. From the glam doll in Kambakht Ishq to girl-next-door (or at least Kareena’s version of it), Kareena’s look has definitely undergone a change. However, it is at odds with the character she plays. How can an orphan afford such expensive clothes?  Salman is well, just Salman. No need to say anymore. He looks good and acts like he always does. However, the age is definitely beginning to show a little, and the whole ‘young couple’ look kind of goes for a toss. Sohail Khan has probably delivered his best performance to date in this movie (which isn’t saying much, considering he has acted in movies like Aryan; but he is quite good here). Yash Tonk is funny in bits and unnoticeable in other bits. Nauheed Cyrusi and Mahek Chahal might as well have been carved out of stone and Dino Morea had a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it appearance. The surprise package of the movie came in the form Bappi Lahiri, who was in his element as Kareena’s boss.  Music is passable, with just one track, Don’t Say Alvida standing out. Preity Zinta’s item song is just about okay. Choreography is not spectacular or even noticeable. Other technical aspects are just okay, though the flashback technique, of going into a black and white zone, looks quite nice.  Salman Khan fans might be a tad bit disappointed, though, with the size of his role. Watch only if you must. Till then keep guessing ki ‘Kiski Mrs. Khanna’ (whose Mrs. Khanna).

A couple other tiny needles I found in the haystack is a couple of glimpses of great comic timing by Ileana D'Cruz, Saurabh Shukla and Arunoday Singh. That is all there is to Main Tera Hero. The rest is, the film fooling itself into believing that it is funny under the garb of mindless comedy.However, what Main Tera Hero makes no pretensions about is that it has no interest in taking anything seriously. So, we have Seenu move randomly from a small town to Bangalore and take on a mean cop (Arunoday Singh) who is obsessed and manically possessive about the girl he is in love with, Sunaina (Ileana D'Cruz), who of course our man Seenu falls in love with at first sight. Only that we have a twist that comes conveniently at half-mark, when you have stopped caring a long time ago. Yeah, Main Tera Hoon is that kind of a film.I would have complained about how the women are at the mercy of the silly games the men play in this game, but then I should know not to do that right from the title of the film.The attempt at comedy is really laughable - most certainly, not in a good way. Its the same old tricks you would have found in a David Dhawan film a couple of decades ago - the slaps, the contrived situations which get worse by the minute. You hit your palm on your forehead and stop yourself from wondering who comes up with stuff like this. Yet, I must admit that Main Tera Hero has much more focus in its plot than an average David Dhawan film.  So much so that, Shakti Kapoor's subplot seems like an afterthought - oops, we are too focused on the central plot by our own standards. That or they thought the film was falling short in terms of runtime. Either case, what an eyesore. The performances are those that belong in a slapstick film. Varun Dhawan monkeys around, Nargis Fakhri adequately continues to annoy, and Anupam Kher makes a fool of himself yet again. Like I said earlier, Ileana D'Cruz, Saurabh Shukla and Arunoday Singh manage a laugh or two, but just about. What boggles my mind is - the 8.30AM show was a full house and so seemed the next one as I walked out after the film. What is as cute as it is despairing is that there was a group in the cinema hall which was laughing out loud and having fun. Sometimes, I wish I could just do that.

52,752,752,752,752,Mama,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/mama-review/,,,,4.466666667,"Mama is an engaging horror film that works because of the mood that it creates. Executive-produced by Guillermo Del Toro, a master of the horror and fantasy genre, the film is dark and eerie, and it manages to spook you out despite relying strongly on familiar tricks of the horror genre. It also makes an emotional connect because of the underlying maternal facet of the story. In spite of a weak finish, Mama makes for a fair one-time watch.","The smartest move from the makers of Mama was putting ‘Guillermo Del Toro presents’ in big, bold letters on the posters of the film. That is enough to draw fans of the supernatural genre and cinephiles in general to the theatres. Directed by Andrés Muschietti, Mama is an old-fashioned horror film that works in spite of familiar tropes, because of the cold, stark feel of the film, and a story that connects with the viewer on a primal level. I must confess right now that I’ve never been scared while watching a horror film, and this time was no different. For me, Mama was a well-shot, moody and engaging story of maternal instinct that transcends rational human thought. So when I say that Mama works as a ‘horror’ film, I’m basing this opinion based on the gasps and nervous laughter I heard from my co-audience in the theater, and the grown man next to me who had his hands in his ears and his head buried into the shoulder of the woman sitting next to him. A brief prologue introduces us to Jeffrey, a depressed man who, after murdering his wife, kidnaps his two young daughters and disappears under mysterious circumstances. Cut to five years later, when two men hired by Jeffrey’s brother, Lucas (who never gave up the hope of finding his two nieces again) finally find the two girls tucked away in an abandoned cabin. Except that the girls are less human and more beast-like, because of prolonged isolation from mankind. Lucas and his girlfriend Annabel take the girls in, hoping to rehabilitate them with the help of Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss, a psychiatrist. Things, of course, don’t go as planned for Lucas and Annabel.Right from the outset, the mood of the film sucks you in. The washed out, sepia tone of the film as it opens, gradually becoming more gray as the film progresses, until the end, which is, for all intents and purposes, black – the film creates atmosphere that is hard not to be taken in by. Expectedly, the film has ample shots of shadows suddenly crossing your field of vision, startling use of the dark parts of a frame to deliver a few chills, sharp cuts accompanied by a screeching background score to shock you – all familiar turf for those who've any experience with horror cinema. Little girls, of course, make for excellent horror film subjects and this movie has two of them – enough to keep the audience on tenterhooks through the film.If the technique of the film aids in creating a tense, chilling mood, it is Jessica Chastain’s performance as Annabel that creates the emotional connect that a film like this really needs. From bass guitarist in a rock band to a reluctant mother, her performance makes the transformation of her character believable, and most of the film’s best moments involve her and the supernatural force in the film. However, the seemingly crisp 100-minute runtime of the film is actually a tad too long for its own good. The strength of a horror film really lies in the portions where nothing is actually happening. It is the anticipation of something happening that almost always contributes to scaring the daylights out of the audience. Mama works best when the supernatural figure isn’t fully revealed. However once the audience actually sees the figure in its entirety, most of the fear element is sucked out. Proceedings eventually get a tad repetitive, and the climax lacks the kind of tension that would leave the audience on a nerve-wracking high. (Yes, the man next to me took his fingers out of his ears in the last fifteen minutes.) Also, I personally felt that the supernatural figure in the film is just not scary enough, because it looks too obviously computer-generated. Still, Mama works primarily because the moments of anticipation in the film almost always have the audience chewing away at more than just their fingernails. Mama is actually the kind of film which would be fun to watch in a packed cinema hall, because there is just something about being a part of a large group that flinches, jerks and gasps all at the same time. While I wasn’t a part of the audience that reacted physically and audibly in my show, I still enjoyed the occasional spooky startle. Occasionally turning to my right to watch a grown man behave like a baby was the icing on the cake.

53,753,753,753,753,Man of Steel,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/man-steel-review/,,5/5.0,,4.8,"Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel is its own enemy because of how much it attempts to pack within itself. David S. Goyer’s & Chris Nolan’s writing ensures that the film feels different from a regular superhero flick for the most, while Snyder executes the action to perfection. The films looks and feels great, but falls shy of being memorable because it tries too hard to be just that. Worth a shot on the big screen, but set your expectations right.","Such a pity that most home video manufacturers prefer to make single-disc DVDs today, packing the film as well the special features into one disc. Luckily, the Man of Steel DVD has no such shortcuts. Packed in a nicely designed outer jacket that has the same illustration as the DVD case, the Man of Steel DVD is a two-disc pack, with, obviously, the film on one disc and the special features on the other. The film itself is likely to have quite a few takers to have as a part of their DVD collection, but some excellent features on the second disc is what truly makes the Man of Steel DVD interesting. The first is an insightful 25-minute featurette titled 'Strong Characters, Legendary Roles' - which talks to the cast and crew about recreating some of the iconic characters from American - and indeed, world - pop culture for this film; how Superman, Lois Lane, General Zod and the likes have been reimagined, while still retaining the core of their characters.The second is also 25 minutes long, a featurette titled 'All-Out Action'. Man of Steel has some truly spectacular action scenes. This video goes behind the scenes, giving the audience a peek into what went into making the action of the film - right from the physical training the actors underwent, to designing all the green-screen action and stunt work. We get to hear from a number of the people who we otherwise never get to hear about. We thus appreciate the sheer magnitude into what it takes to achieve what we finally see on screen - these are the guys who truly create magic.After the first two, the third featurette is a rather tame 6-minuter titled 'Krypton Decoded', a video with the Visual Effects Supervisor of the film, who takes us through some of the technology that has been designed for Krypton in the film.Thankfully, the film itself also comes in multiple Indian languages - Hindi, Tamil & Telugu - apart from English. Man of Steel was projected as an 'event' film, and the DVD of the film reflects the same; if you liked the film, then you'll love the DVD. Delving far deeper (than previous screen adaptations) into the Superman origin mythology as well as the moral dilemma that an extraordinary being on a planet of ordinary mortals would face, Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel, backed by the formidable writing team of David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan, manage to camouflage their big Hollywood summer blockbuster quite well. More reminiscent of Nolan’s now-legend superhero take – with it’s nervous, edgy hand-held camera constantly on the move, attempting to infuse a certain grittiness into the moments where our hero has to struggle with the most basic problem of existence – choice – the film ‘feels’ different from just another gargantuan VFX vehicle.But, that is ultimately what it is.Relentless in its spectacular visual offering while never easing up on the fundamental conflict that young Clarke Kent faces before he ultimately rises to become the godlike protector of humanity, the core predicament that the film finds itself in is the fact that it attempts to pack in too much of too many good things. One grand, terrifically executed action set piece, followed by what will doubtlessly be termed a Nolan-esque peek into the world’s most widely known superhero. Repeat; more times than you can count. By essentially following this structure (which, incidentally, is also non-linear, particular in the first hour), the film almost ends up becoming too much to take.The film opens on the planet Krypton, which is on the brink of self-implosion; scientist Jor-El chooses to save his newborn son by sending him to a distant foreign planet, with the larger aim of ensuring the continuance of his species as well. Infant Kal, son of Jor from the House of El, thus finds himself with the Kents in Smallville, Kansas. And thus begins a long search for meaning for Clark Kent - a search that sets him on collision course with General Zod, former military leader of Krypton, who is also tied intricately with Kal-El’s past.Reminiscent, more than a few times, of The Matrix in terms of the superhero origin story (with Biblical references to boot, which I’d rather you discover for yourself, if you’re inclined), the film also reminds you of Nolan’s own Batman Begins in the manner in which Kal-El’s search for meaning is treated. (Think images of a stubbled Bruce Wayne’s tryst with street thugs before he crosses paths with Ra’s Al Ghul.) Man of Steel, however, falters because it is just too big for its own good. Despite being overcooked, the film is undoubtedly an audio-visual treat. Hans Zimmer’s score is moody, orchestral and grand; it goes great with the film. Few shoot action the way Zack Snyder does, and if you thought the action in 300 and Watchmen were shot well, wait till you watch Man of Steel. However, if the writing of the film appears weak because of the sheer number of big action scenes that it has, directorially Zack Snyder looks a little out of sorts when it comes to the more emotionally intimate scenes involving Clark/Kal-El and his parents, his birth father and Lois Lane. Henry Cavill grew on me through the film. Despite seeming like a fish out of water initially, in retrospect, perhaps that was just how young Clark felt while growing up amidst people who rejected him for being ‘different’. By the end of the film, Cavill easily makes for the best Superman in recent times. He’ll perhaps never match the popularity of Christopher Reeve, but this Superman is different anyway, and not just because he does away with the red underwear. Russel Crowe as Jor-El is terrific, despite having some truly incredulous lines to deliver. Michael Shannon as General Zod was a tad disappointing, but that was perhaps only because it is rare to have a villain with as much moral ambiguity as him. If you look at things from his point of view, you’ll realize that one can easily justify his stance in the film. In such a scenario, the ‘triumph of good over evil’ remains questionable, and hence, unsatisfying. With a nearly 2.5 hour runtime, it boils down, then, to your expectations. Set them right and don’t expect to be completely blown away with the film. You’ll have a good time, that much Snyder & Co guarantee. Expect the film to put The Dark Knight and The Avengers to shame, and the film is bound to fall way short.

Worried for the country, worried for humanity. Yes, that means it is a film you must watch at least once, even if you don't rush to the theater.","At its core, Manjhi is a romantic film. Surprisingly enough it is the typical kind of romantic film too – guy woos, puppy-eyed love happens, family opposes, couple overcomes. Yet, there is nothing typical about the way it plays out. As the political undertone gets heavier, the gut wrenches. At moments like these you thank goodness for the drama, but as usual it jolts you away from the film's reality.When an element like slow motion or voice-over is used to add a tinge of drama in a film of this nature, the film reminds you that it is a film. But when the film is inspired from a real life situation, the relief is only temporary. Because it is only a moment before you realise that reality must be worse than what is making you cringe right now.Sample this. 51 years. Not five decades, over five decades – that is how much time it took bureaucrats and politicians to do what they were supposed to do. Just 13 years after independence, the fight for the nation's freedom had already lost its meaning with the system taking charge in the form of corruption and nepotism. The affluent tortured the poor, just to maintain an air of power. The inhumanity has only gotten worse and there's little hope for improvement. This is what I left the movie with.However, the movie tells this story using Dashrath Manjhi's love for his wife. You could call him obstinate/stubborn or you could call him persistent/passionate, but the story is pretty much unbelievable. Had it not been a known true story, you'd say, “this happens only in films.” Of course, made believable as much by its telling as by Nawazuddin Siddiqui's performance. You are so taken by Manjhi's hardwork and resolve that you completely forget – at least while watching the film – that the role must have called for a remarkable amount of the same qualities from the actor as well. What more can you say about an actor who does that to you for a couple of hours of screen time?Radhika Apte is as sensuous as ever. She adds unexpected spunk to her character because we are so used to seeing lower caste women being demure and submissive. Tigmanshu Dhulia and Pankaj Tripathi are believable but it has become difficult to imagine them as anything other than evil incarnate. The visuals are spectacular. Yet, the grim subject might not be your idea of entertainment. Nevertheless, you ought to see it, even if once. Maybe watching it in the cosiness of your home will add more perspective. Manjhi is one of those films that are depressing and yet are meant to give hope. Like Dashrath say, if he can try to break a mountain, then why can't you take a crack at that mountainous problem in your life?

More power to debutante director Navdeep Singh for having the courage and the vision to give us what is possibly the finest noir film in an Indian language.  Yes, in the fifties we had them for sure, notable amongst them being Baazi and Aar Paar, both directed by Guru Dutt, but they suffered from the fact that the mores of film making in India did not really allow the chief protagonist to be cynical, morally ambiguous, and deeply pessimistic about the world: a world that  was jaded and characterized by an acute loss of faith in ‘universal’ values of love and justice.  The Noir (French for night, literally and figuratively standing for ‘black film’) genre gave us such Hollywood films like The Maltese Falcon and The Asphalt Jungle in the forties and fifties, and more recently the conventions of the genre have been reworked in neo noir films like the Coen Brothers’ Blood Simple and Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner.So what does the director do here?  Navdeep Singh has crafted a film dripping with nuances of life in a small desert town, and has used the metaphor of the desert to suggest the aridness and sterility of the life of the chief protagonist, Satyaveer Randhawa, underplayed superbly by Abhay Deol.  We have the character elements of the noir genre in ample measure: a morally ambiguous, loveless world, populated by cynical and apathetic characters each driven by their own lusts and greed, the femme fatale who is sympathetic to the hero, mysterious damsels in distress, the aging patriarch with his insatiable ravenousness for power justifying his actions by appealing to the “natural order of things”, crooked cops, scummy goons, and nosey neighbors.The script is an inspired retelling of Roman Polanski’s seventies noir classic Chinatown and to the director’s credit, he does not hide it, but instead pays tribute to it in his own way by reworking the plot and some key scenes to suit his point of view.  He also throws in a direct reference to the original just to make sure you get the point.Unlike traditional noir films, the camera work does not frame scenes in stark contrasts of light and dark, with fog and or steam cloaking people in a half light, neither is the film set in the mean streets of a city lovingly photographed to make sure that all the grittiness and grime stand out.  Instead here we have the desert in all its harshness as well as in gentler moods, and scarred and pitted monuments serve as the back drop to existential ruminations and the unfolding of the plot.  The camera lingers on the characters and their reactions; it frames the characters tightly, especially inside darkened rooms, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere that goes well with the dark machinations in the plot.
The cast has done a good job: both Raima Sen and Gul Panag are competent, and Vinay Pathak is simply superb as the local Sub Inspector with his cynical outlook on life.The film does not have a climax in the conventional sense, which may leave a lot of people feeling highly dissatisfied, but a degree of redemption is achieved by the chief protagonist.  Satyaveer Randhawa is again not a hero, he is not the good guy who is absolutely honest and incorruptible, but as the film proceeds, we understand that he is corrupt too.  Evil is not vanquished in the end, neither does justice triumph.  Evil is something that is at best lived with, because it resides in us and not in the ""villain"".  All that we can do is to come to terms with it and with ourselves.For those who are looking for a typical ""thriller"" film with the ""good guy"" vanquishing the ""bad guys"", this film is best avoided.  For those who like their life complex, their characters morally ambiguous, and would like to ponder on the workings of fate and existence, this is a film that you must see.

57,757,757,757,757,Mardaani,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewNotepadPreview33 Critic Reviews 3.6/5.0 4 Reader Reviews 4/5.0 123 Tweet Reviews 4.4/5.0,/movie/mardaani-review/,3.6/5.0,4/5.0,4.4/5.0,4.0,A slick even if not taut thriller more than a film that keeps the social issue it is about in your mind after you walk out. ,"It is just so refreshing to watch a Hindi film that has not been lengthened by forcing in a romantic track and songs. I understand, that shouldn't be a reason to bump any film's rating up. Unfortunately for the film, that is one of the main things you come out with. NOT the social issue it is trying to create awareness about. Till the film starts getting preachy and goes into a monologue, Mardaani is a well-narrated story with all the elements in-sync. But, the last fifteen minutes is downhill towards any typical thriller.That is not to say, that the action in the last bit is not engaging. It is in fact very slick and Rani Mukherjee moves smartly. But, a voiceover that explains how things worked out, is the biggest turn-off in a thriller. And it is a shame because till then Mardaani didn't have a single dull moment. It's not that the plot twists weren't forseeable. You could see, some of the biggest turning points in the story from a few minutes before they happened. But, since you are rooting for the right thing to happen, you don't mind the predictability.The writing to a great extent keeps you intrigued by one means or the other. Even though, it has the usual trappings of a supercop film. Like, showing the cop's happy family for one and only one reason. And of course, there are loopholes or leaps of faith. On the other hand, there are other things the writing department takes head-on. The dialogue is witty, even if the way the abuses are delivered sound forced, for effect, rather than natural. But, other than that the lines bring a smile or make you smirk. The lead characters are written reasonably well too. The topic of sexual trafficking is such that the audience is already rooting for the story. In addition, Mardaani's bad guy instills fear appropriately. Also, a rarity in Hindi films, you see and enjoy a vibrant chemistry between the protagonist and the antagonist. This with Shivani (Rani Mukherjee) and the villain (Tahir Bhasin) hardly being in the same physical space. Again, it's not too often when both the sides are equally smart, cool and unfazed. Of course, this wouldn't have worked hadn't it been for Rani Mukherjee and Tahir Bhasin's performances. Though Rani Mukherjee starts out being loud, but you soon get used it, because the character is written that way. She's strong and  has a fight in her. Always. It is commendable that there is not an ounce of glamor around Rani Mukherjee and she stays in character throughout. My usual gripe with movies that address social issues is they make some characters (usually the main leads) representative of a larger group of people say, the youth or women or the common man. Which is not bad in itself, but the story slips in and out from being about the character and being symbolic of the said group. Mardaani saves itself from that trap for most of the film. It is telling you the story of this one lady officer who has taken it upon herself to get to the bad guy for a personal reason (to start with) and it moves on to being about a larger purpose. It is also refreshing that the film doesn't make much ado about it being women-centric. It sticks to the points of one - being a thriller and two - talking about trafficking. Sort-of neutralises the fact that a film with a woman at the center is ironically called, Mardaani.Yes, child trafficking for sexual crimes needs awareness. Yes, more and more films need to be made on such issues. Yes, Mardaani is a decent film. Alas, the issue is not what you come out thinking about. I wonder if there were censor cuts that took away bits that were needed to get us more involved with those who suffered. But, meanwhile, this will do. And go give, Lakshmi a watch too. Note, I am not saying instead, I am saying both. Each has a different approach - only that one is worth a watch and the other ought to be watched.

But it doesn't necessarily get you engaged through and through.","Young adulthood, experimenting with one's sexuality, being comfortable with one's selfishness because that is good for you, relentlessness of life, society's attitude towards homosexuality, dealing with death, and of course society's juggle between harmful over-sensitivity and insensitivity towards differently-abled people – these are some of the themes that Margarita With A Straw touches upon. Each of these make for a film by itself. Usually, a movie that tries to achieve all of this falls flat because it ends up being all over the place. Margarita With A Straw manages to tie it in all together, even if just barely. That in itself is an achievement, other than the fact that it even dares to touch upon so many topics that remain largely untouched by Hindi films. Here's a confused yet composed character who is at most times sure of what she wants and finds one way or the other to get it – even if it is a way of resolving her confusion. She could teach us a lesson or two in accepting and loving ourselves with our flaws. Oh and she happens to suffer from cerebral palsy. She is an inspiration not only because of her disability, but because she is as normal as it gets. She is mean when she has to be, manipulative as necessary and generally a warm and cool person – Laila (Kalki Koechlin). I am grateful to the writers, makers and actors for not making Laila an ideal, sacchrine person who we are compelled to like – as in you will be judged if you don't like her. Instead she is a person as grey as you and I. On the other hand, I always struggle with films that I find myself being thankful to for things they did not do. Isn't creating a multi-layered protagonist what a writer supposed to do? Setting that aside, that I sensed all these layers without it necessarily being spelt out for me says it all as far as Kalki Koechlin's performance goes. Within a few minutes you start seeing Laila as a person beyond her disability. Can there be a better compliment for an actor who is playing a character with a disability, a developmental disability at that? Each of the other characters are played by equally strong actors. Though they aren't written as strongly. For example, Revathi who plays Laila's mom plays it too cool for an Indian parent. If she is indeed a cool mom, that doesn't show through her character, but is something you have to accept because you are told so. In comparison, her father seems to be a more liberal parent of the two. Similarly, Laila's lady friend, Khanoum (Sayani Gupta) gets a rather flat treatment after the initial intrigue she creates. And yet, these seem mere niggles in the broader space the film tries to encompass. It is indeed a challenge to get through talking about such topics, each one more important than the next, without being preachy. This one too slips into a “lesson” mode for a moment or so reminding you that it is a film. Even so, the film seems like it needed to be made. And it needs to be watched.Margarita With A Straw is a statement on behalf the world's largest minority as Maysoon Zayid who suffers from Cerebral Palsy and calls it one of her 99 problems points out in her TED talk. They want to be disassociated from their disability. They want to create an identity that is separate from their disability. Like Maysoon, palsy is just one of the problems Laila has. Similarly, Margarita With A Straw is simply amazing at the number of things it tries to achieve. Then again, just like it is wrong, at many levels, to reward a person because of their disability, would it be right to award points to a film because it is about a disabled person or the n other topics it touches upon? The related conundrum is do you take away points just because you don't want to be going wrong at many levels? That the question arises itself is testimony enough that Margarita With A Straw leaves a bit amiss.I can complain about not being touched deep within or I can feel happy that it didn't try to manipulate my emotions while having such a bait at its disposal and more. But, one thing it certainly is not is underwhelming. Now or later, in theaters or when its out elsewhere – do watch it! And legally, please.

I understand, some times that is what a commercial film needs, but it shouldn't be done to such an extent that you start questioning every episode you see on screen. So much so that, I came home to check the chronology of some events and was hugely disappointed with the way the timing of the climax (including the opponent Mary Kom plays) is changed around for filmy effect. I shouldn't be made to wait to get to Google to look up Mary Kom's life, I should want to be with the film for a long, long time. Then for a person who knows nothing about boxing, I wonder if the technicalities of boxing were shown appropriately. Without wanting to look it up (more because of disinterest rather than anything else) I am willing to place my money on boxing technicalities being totally ignored. It does look like an ill-researched project or worse, one where well-done research is intentionally disregarded.You then have the narrative itself. The screenplay is way too episodic almost like you are watching the film one short chapter after another. Almost as if to cover this drawback, the first half of the film even tries its hand at non-linear narration. Else, there is no particular reason to take us back and forth on the timeline.It is heartening though, that all these gaps in writing are sidelined by the best efforts of the cast. Priyanka Chopra and Darshan Kumaar are all equally earnest in their performances. At times, the dialogue help at others the filminess distracts but you cannot put the dialogue delivery at fault. This is despite the distracting make-up, colored and straightened hair, where none belonged. The actors make you root for the real-life people. If not for the blatant product placement, you would feel their pain with them too. While a husband's support for his wife's career, especially such a demanding one should be a given, not every one gets it. Less so, in small-town or rural India. I am happy that Mary Kom's husband, Onler's sacrifices and contribution received as much screen time as it did. This is an inspirational story of its own. And oh the irony of seeing sugar free, Iodex and Usha advertise their way into a film about one of the country's  athletes who in real-life struggled to find sponsors and financial support for most of her career. I guess we should just be thankful that there were no item numbers to make the film commercially appealing.So, would I take my kids to the theater to watch this one? Unlikely, will certainly not make extra effort. But would want them to watch it when it's on TV, just to see the power of strong will. Fortunately or unfortunately, it's not for the cinema, it's for the real-life person who deserved a film about her life. It is also interesting that a biopic has been made of a person whose career is still on. So for all you know, the story isn't over yet and we have the chance for an even more inspirational Mary Kom 2 at our hands, and hopefully a better film too.

Nor is it gay despite its wit. Masaan carries equanimity of sorts in the “life is what it is” kind of a way with simplicity and flair in equal measure.","“It will all sort itself out.” says a girl to her boyfriend earnestly, a spark of optimism shining through her eyes at having found a solution. A solution to her problem. A solution to all problems – including yours and mine. An answer to a question the film itself raises, “When does this grief go away?”. “It will all sort itself out,” hardly a profound statement, but a hope that we all have to live by, if life has to make any sense at all. Masaan set in those parts of the River Ganges that is a crematorium – has talks about life. And it goes about its business with tenderness. It does leave you with a sense of discontent – maybe its own way of making one last comment on life. Masaan narrates the stories of two very ordinary lives, except for that one big event that turns their worlds downside up. Not only do they have to overcome those incidents but also break free from bondages that were holding them in the first place. While Masaan is set in a small town, these two stories would resonate with any section of the audience from any place in the country. Maybe because they aren't spectacular tales. Their problem could be replaced by ours and the way we cope with it remains more or less same. When you are talking about a film and the first few things are related to how engaging the theme is, you know the film has done its job in all the departments. In fact, Masaan makes a comment about the country's attitude towards sex and the lop-sided morality it carries for men and women. But, as the film progresses and becomes less and less about that. It becomes about the other themes and all other aspects of film-making are taken for granted.The writing, for example, is thoroughly engaging. Not only because it has witty lines or insightful ones, but because it also has ordinary lines that are timed perfectly. In fact, the timing of the dialogue (and not only how it is delivered) draws you further into the narrative. There are unresolved scenes which add to the narrative and the discontent. You don't know the motivations of a character and eventually it doesn't matter. You are in the moment with the characters and that's all that counts. The characters – Devi (Richa Chadda) or her father Choudhary (Sanjay Mishra), Deepak (Vicky Kaushal) - are all a bit broken and thus complete. Deepak's girlfriend Shaalu (Shweta Tripathi) is that one person in anyone's life who is vivacious and yet balanced. Even a largely dark character like a blackmailing police officer shows a hint of humanity. Vicky Kaushal,  Shweta Tripathi and Sanjay Mishra are such naturals in their roles that Richa Chadda who usually stumps you with her performances feels drab. Sure, her character is yet to recover from the shock that life has brought on her. Yet, she sticks out as vacant amidst the candour of the rest of the actors. There isn't much of a situational connect between the two stories. The connect is more philosophical. Hence, we'll never know what would happen if the actual connect which seems forced wasn't there. What if the stories ran parallel with the river Ganges, the ring, the train serving as connects. And the loneliness. The impermanence of it all – love and grief over the loss of love; life and grief over the loss of life. Equanimity.

63,763,763,763,763,Masala,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/masala-review/,,,,4.566666667,"With Masala, Girish Kulkarni’s conquests as a writer and actor continue. Fresh on the heels of his National Award for Deool, comes a charming little film about two protagonists whom you start feeling for within minutes. The rest of the film’s experience is about some excellent performances and the smile that you’ll have on your face throughout. Masala should be watched.","‘Mi anandasathi kahich karat nahin, anandani karto’ (I don’t do things for happiness, I do them happily) proclaims Dilip Prabhavalkar, who plays an eccentric scientist who conducts experiments for social good in his homegrown lab – experiments that often go BOOM! This line, and indeed Dilip Prabhavalkar’s character, is one of the many quirky aspects of Masala, produced by Umesh Kulkarni and Girish Kulkarni, the men behind Deool.Directed by debutante Sandesh Kulkarni, Masala is another feather in the cap of National Award winner Girish Kulkarni, one of the finds of Indian cinema in recent times. If Deool was though-provoking in an obvious manner, Masala takes a slightly different route to make you think – it makes you smile. Girish Kulkarni and Amruta Subhash play a young married couple who are constantly on the run from creditors. Their life is just a cycle wherein they go to a new place, set up shop, end up owing money to people because they themselves are owed money and ultimately end up sneaking away to a new place in the midst of the night. Along the way, they face situations and meet characters that are like milestones in their quest for a state of equilibrium. While every character in Masala makes you smile, a closer inspection will reveal that they stand for so much more than what they appear to be on the surface – Dilip Prabhavalkar’s mad scientist for example – an analogy can be drawn between his life and the life of our protagonist couple.  While Girish Kulkarni’s performance undoubtedly needs to be lauded, it is his writing that is the real star of Masala. With crackling, insightful dialogue and a screenplay that makes the film a true journey for the characters as well as the audience, Girish Kulkarni once again proves the old adage - content is ultimately king. Amruta Subhash also delivers an earnest performance as his wife. She is charming and sincere and you truly feel for her character of a woman who stands by her husband like a rock. Of course, watching actors like Dr. Mohan Agashe and Dilip Prabhavalkar is always a joy. Their characters are like mirrors for the protagonist. It is through them that his journey seems to acquire meaning. Dr. Shreeram Lagoo’s name on the poster of the film excited me, and his brief appearance was heart-warming as always, even though I least expected him to appear as the character he played in the film. Another place where the film exceeded my expectations was its technique. Masala is visually appealing in terms of its cinematography, even though one can easily tell which shots were taken with a DSLR. Also, a special mention must be made of the background score. It seemed to hit just the right note when the situation demanded it, complimenting the character’s state of mind well. I did have some reservations about the manner in which the film was edited, but they were more on the creative side rather than the technical. I would perhaps have structured the film slightly differently, but I’d have to watch the film again to be sure. In fact, Masala is one of the only Marathi films I’ve seen lately which I feel like watching twice, only because something tells me that in all of the humour and charm, I may have missed out on something that lay far deeper. I only hope that as many people as possible watch this film at least once, if only to spend some time in their life smiling a real smile.

64,764,764,764,764,[The] Master,Owner's Pride!,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/master-review/,,5/5.0,,4.9,"Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest, incredibly haunting film The Master, is ideally meant for those who believe in having personal relationships with cinema; it is open to multiple readings and interpretations, and demands repeated viewings of it. There is no harm in believing cinema is meant to entertain, but I urge those who believe they love cinema to sample The Master on the big screen. You may or may not be as intrigued and drawn to it as so many are, but it will invariably cause you to ask questions, not just of the film, but of yourself. ","Easily the most poetic and haunting film I’ve watched on the big screen in a long time, (Anand Gandhi’s Ship of Theseus comes a close second,) Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master is an extraordinarily melancholic and layered film that seems to be about so many things, and then again about nothing at all, all at once. But with this film, Paul Thomas Anderson once again underlines the fact that he is one of the most daringly original thinkers that American cinema has produced, ever.Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix, terrific in his return) is a broken man, a World War II seaman trying to deal with life in a post-war world. He is sexually frustrated, almost always high on booze (that he makes himself using commonplace ingredients that he finds at hand), and is perhaps looking for direction in his life. He seems to find this direction in the words and teachings of Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman, beautifully nuanced), the founder of a philosophical stream of thought known as ‘The Cause’. The core of the film is the mysterious relationship between the two polar opposites that Freddie and Dodd (called ‘Master’ by his followers) represent. Freddie is wayward, eccentric, filled with nervous energy that is constantly looking for an outlet, or better yet, a form of control. Dodd, on the other hand, seems always in control for the most. Freddie is, in many ways, looking for meaning in his life, something to bow down to, like a master. Dodd provides that to some extent, but there always seems to be something missing, something that you can’t quite place. As the film strips away and lays bare before you the characters of Freddie and Dodd, it also hides so much more than it shows, inviting you deeper into it, to draw meaning. Like how some of Freddie’s actions often draw smirks or even laughs, but if you pause to think about it, the weight of loneliness and frustrations behind his actions should, if anything, make one cry. Of course, pre-release, one of the film’s most talked-about aspects was the fact that the character of Lancaster Dodd is based Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. The parallels between The Cause and Scientology are very clear; Anderson makes no attempt to mask it. So be it the past-life regression and the healing powers that Dodd attributes to it, the belief that man can cure his ailments in his current life by delving into his previous lives and curing him there, albeit mentally – all these and many more are all there. However, anyone expecting to find out the mystery behind what makes so many millions around the world follow Scientology as a religion is bound to be disappointed. Joaquin Phoenix’s performance as Freddie is one of the most gut-wrenching portrayals of a character in recent times. Perhaps Daniel Day Lewis did deserve his Best Actor Oscar for his performance as Lincoln, but some may say that the man had the added benefit of prosthetics as well as historical reference points to help him ‘feel’ more like the 16th President of the United State. But Joaquin Phoenix inhabits Freddie with the kind of body language and state of mind that had no reference point, and for that alone, he must be lauded. Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as Lancaster Dodd. A Paul Thomas Anderson staple, his filmography with Anderson alone shows the remarkable range that Hoffman has. It is tough to even imagine that the same guy who played Scotty in Boogie Nights has played Lancaster Dodd in The Master.Mihai Mălaimare Jr’s gorgeous cinematography and Johnny Greenwood’s sparsely arranged but no-less haunting music embellish the sense of loneliness and the endless hunt for meaning that the film essentially is. Also, what a pity that we don’t get a 70mm release for the film in India. The kind of detail that every 70mm frame would hold would perhaps give a little more insight into what Anderson is trying to say in every shot. Paul Thomas Anderson is an absolute master at taking the basest of human characteristics and weaving near-epic films out of them. He is also particularly skilled in making a film feel like it is lighter – so to speak – than it actually is. But with The Master, he goes more esoteric than he has ever done before; it asks more from a viewer than most viewers are used to giving to a film. Though many will disagree, I have long held the view that truly great cinema can only be appreciated on repeated viewings. Anyone who calls, for example, The Godfather, or Pulp Fiction, great films after watching them once has absolutely no idea why these films are great; they have to be watched repeatedly to see what true cinematic greatness is. Which is why The Master is the kind of film that will have polarized opinions. There will either be those who will reject the film in the first viewing, not wondering what the big deal is about, or there will be those who will feel like continuously revisiting it, attempting to draw more meaning with each subsequent viewing, then reading up on it and watching it again. They will continuously question themselves on what Dodd’s intentions were, when it came to Freddy. Or when, exactly, did Dodd and Freddie first meet? Or was that a hint of homoeroticism they spotted in the relationship between Dodd and Freddie? Or what are Dodd’s exact intentions with The Cause itself? And what, really, does the film even mean? If you are looking for it, the film always gives you the feeling that you’ve missed something. Likely then, that if you ask Anderson himself just what the film is about, he’ll probably only say, “Secrets.”

The only difference is an ace act by Pankaj Kapur, 2-3 wonderfully insightful dialogues, and some feisty, witty lines. ","There's always a story behind how the film was made and every once in a while the viewer likes to voice out how he thinks it must've panned out. So this is how Matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola just might have rolled.Not-so-sober Vishal Bharadwaj: This system is frustrating, the politicians are despicably corrupt, the businessmen are making biryani out of the farmer's blood and labor, this country is going down the tube. We need to do something!Sober Vishal Bharadwaj: Let's make  a movie.Not-so-sober VB: Ah-ha! Why not? People protest by participating in peace marches, wearing pink chaddis, and replace their display pictures with black dots on Facebook and Twitter. They do what they know how to do, I know how to make films. Perfect.Sober VB: But, all this political shoo-shaa, the angst of the farmer, etc is too serious, our aam junta will get terribly bored. Not-so-sober VB: Political satire it is, then!Sober VB: Good thinking, there! Let's add a love angle to the mix, just for good measure.Not-so-sober VB: You think? I was hoping to add a woman to the mix but more like a vamp. Sober VB: You have yours, I'll have mine. Deal?Not-so-sober: Only if you let me go a little crazy.Sober VB: Crazy is good, the multiplex junta loves it! Not-so-sober VB: Promise me, you won't let go of the focus on the issue with the love triangle.Sober VB: I'll sign the papers, if you don't go overboard with the crazy bit just because I agreed. Not-so-sober VB: Yes! dances the happily-ever-after dance Anything that is repeated too often or for too long, like the film's quirkiness or this reviewing style, gets old  too soon. Fortunately or unfortunately, both not-so-sober VB and sober VB got to make their films, respectively. Yes, as usual, the not-so-sober one makes more sense. Matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola starts the bang with an incredibly insane title - it readies you for the zaniness to look forward to. The 'no smoking' disclaimer is a witty, ironical, slap-in-the-face start to a film. The buffoonery begins and builds up to a ""you got to be kiddin' me"" level. And just at the right moment, a decent element of story is added in the form of a strong, burning issue in the country. The issue at hand represents many other issues we are faced with in the real world. The politician represents how we as the citizens perceive our politicians. And how we see them play footsie with the businessmen whose deep pockets want to grow only deeper while taking the entire nation for a ride. Then, you wait for the big climax, you wait for the drama to reach a peak, you wait for the big climax, you wait for the exhilaration that it will bring along, you wait for the big climax. And it doesn't come. I am ever-so-grateful to Vishal Bharadwaj for not making the climax a huge jingoistic movement. I am also grateful to him for not having characters make u-turns from their basic natures. I can't even complain about the end being silly because I indeed thought it'd be atrociously out-of-this-world kind-of silly. I have a feeling I'd have enjoyed it that way because of the build-up of craziness. Unfortunately, it doesn't go all the way.Matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola cannot claim to be about the three characters Matru, Bijli and Mandola either. None of them is given any depth nor are any of the relationships paid attention to. To seal the anti-climax, comes the title song made solely for the purpose of marketing and you give a Rohit-Shetty/Farah-Khan worthy shudder as you see Shabana Azmi (who plays a vamp) do the signature dance step! Why?It is one thing to make a political satire about a serious issue and quite another to market the movie as comedy and fun without letting the audience in on the seriousness. Are the viewers not worthy of knowing what the film is really about? Or do the makers not have the guts of selling the product for what it is? Make Shabana Azmi dance out-of-context, really? I can't get over it.And yet, despite some episodic side-plots, Matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola is not a complete wash-out. It has some disarmingly witty dialogue, especially reserved for Mandola (Pankaj Kapur). There are at least three scenes in the second half that stay with you because of powerful lines, insight, sarcasm, and delivery. And if these don't work for you, Pankaj Kapur's performance alone is enough to carry this film for you. From the mumbling alcoholic to the delirious alcohol-quitter to the stone-sober, cold businessman - Pankaj Kapur does the whole range without once going over-the-top despite the genre of goofy satire that the film belongs to. Shabana Azmi holds her ground as the ambitious and manipulative politician. She has one scene that she could have shined in. But she is overpowered by the theatrical setting that is necessary  for the powerful and insightful dialogue she delivers. Imran Khan doesn't have much scope to be different from his usual except for occasionally slipping into a Haryanvi accent. And as I said, like anything that is repeated too often or for too long, Anushka Sharma's wink-and-grin-wide routine is getting old too. Arya Babbar gets to play stupid and well he plays it appropriately.I don't mind a serious film, I don't mind socio-politics, I don't mind satire, I certainly don't mind quirky, dark humor. What I don't get though is why a film can't pick one or two of these themes and stick to it through and through - be there, build-up on it  and end like the makers believed in what they were making, without any external pressures.

67,767,767,767,767,Matter,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review,/movie/matter-review/,,,,2.8,"Essentially a ‘bro-mance’ between four youngsters who are forced to enter Mumbai’s murky underworld, Matter is the kind of film that should never have been made. With virtually nothing going for it except for a few scenes involving the playful camaraderie between the four lead characters, Matter is mediocre for the most part, sometimes downright cheap. An insult to the senses, including the sixth and the seventh, children in particular should be kept away from this film.","The fact that the last film I saw before Matter on the big screen was Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather, has nothing to do with what I eventually felt about Matter. A film so poorly written that even school plays parodying ‘Indian Idol’ seem better, Matter is the kind of film that, apart from doing nothing for the cause of Marathi cinema, may also have ended up having an adverse effect on the mind of that young boy who was sitting with his parents in the last row of the screen where I saw the film. He will probably grow up not believing in the magic of cinema.Three young kids growing up in a rough neighborhood in Mumbai commit a murder to avenge the rape of the sister of one of them. They are sent to a juvenile delinquent home for reformation, where they become friends with another young kid, Ronnie. Together, the four of them grow up to become the main leads of the film, four wastrels who can’t find decent work because they are branded as criminals or bhais because of one mistake in their childhood. Their solution? “A bad name is better than no name, so let us just become actual bhais instead.” And thus begins a torturous couple of hours comprising primarily of guns, girls and gaalis (profanity) (or whatever they could get through the censors). Riddled with showboating technical gimmickry, including crass transitions and unnecessary camera movements, Matter has almost nothing right with it. The screenplay is so poorly written that I can’t even use my favourite phrase, ‘lost the plot’ to describe it, simply because they never had a plot in the first place. A host of mindless characters, situations, scenes, songs and twists pepper proceedings until the merciful end, something that I have never been more grateful for.To be fair, the four male leads, played by Santosh Juvekar, Jitendra Joshi, Rajesh Shringapure and Sushant Shelar, share a decent camaraderie. The best scenes of the film are invariably those where the four of them are needling one another. Acting is clearly in the blood of not one of them, but they are all endearing in a goofy way. It is when they decide that they want to ‘rule’ Mumbai that they end up looking like the clowns that they are.And then of course, there is Sameer Dharmadhikari playing bad-ass cop Vikram Pradhan, who believes that ‘Mumbai saaf toh sau gunhe maaf’. (If Mumbai is clean, then all crimes are forgiven) He leads a pack of caricature-ish side characters including Muslim dons in South Mumbai and an unscrupulous female politician who shelters the underworld. The film meanders along aimlessly without a message or a story with a very clear single point agenda – ‘let us make a cool film on the Mumbai underworld’, an agenda which it miserably fails at.Clearly, someone who held the keys to the safe saw the disaster that was in the making midway through, because what starts off looking like a film with a certain level of production value eventually descends into a mess of digitally shot, poorly colour-corrected footage put together to complete the film.Matter is a film best avoided, one that children in particular must definitely be kept away from.

Seriously. And it takes all of two hours and f-o-r-t-y long minutes for boy to meet girl, about four times after which I lost count. 
Mausam is beautifully shot, no doubt about that, but a regular love story takes forever to finish, and then there's some more left. And nope, after the first half of the first half is over, there is nothing at all that could make the lovers' frustrating journey engaging.","Mausam is like a pleasant evening breeze - you enjoy it for a bit and then fall asleep. Which is extremely sad, because you see the labour of love in each frame. It's pretty in every corner. But, the love story unfortunately goes on and on like a battery in its advert. Fine, I didn’t fall asleep but that's because I don't believe in sleeping in films, especially the ones I'm reviewing. But, I could completely imagine someone dozing off for a bit, and guess what they wouldn't have missed much when they woke up. Ironically, the eased-out pace Mausam starts with, is the only bit that's charming about the story. It's so pretty, so serene, so simple that high expectations are set for the drama to unfold. I enjoyed the leisurely life of a village with its cute sense of humor. But maybe, like life in the village, the story doesn't move. The characters move on, their problems and state of mind remain the same. Which is fine, that's what happens when we are in love. But, I'd enjoy my love story, I lose connection with the love between Harry (Shahid Kapoor) and Aayat (Sonam Kapoor). And there are enough, ""aawwww, so sweet"" moments in the first half hour. I also admired how the ""sarson de khet"" (mustard farms) I've been fed for over 15 years, felt fresh in the way they have been captured. The straight lines that railway tracks and electrical poles formed; the curves that bumpy paths and underground water pipes lying around the said ""sarso de khet"" formed - all very painstakingly framed. In fact, except for a tacky video-game-ish air-attack sequence, Mausam is beautifully shot. But, the sweetness of a relationship and the cinematography of a film can take it only so far. Of course, there is value to getting exasperated along with the characters' frustrations. But, not if it translates to irritation with the film itself. Not if, in a love story, you are forced to say, ""true love and all is ok, make them meet and get done with it already!"" And it's not like the writers haven't put in distractions along the way. There are enough of them. And I'm not talking about just the energetic songs which make you feel like you can watch Shahid Kapoor dance forever. There is historical and political context within which our lead pair struggles. Politics that you and I have witnessed. Times that we have horrific memories of. We should've gotten involved, we should've rooted for the lead pair. We don't. This is despite the fact that you see at least one of the two beautiful people in each frame of the screen. I didn't quite get why Harry went so rigid. I was almost going to blame Shahid Kapoor for not being able to carry off the ""serious"" facet of Harry, but soon realized that Harry had lost all his charm and vigor. Sonam Kapoor on the other hand maintains a status quo throughout the film. In fact, her expressions are a carry forward from her debut film, Saawariya.A love story between a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl minus the parents who usually raise hell. The lovers' bad luck keeps getting worse and the hatred around them won't let them be together. Hatred that isn't even directly linked to their lives. The tragedy is rather poetic, in that, the two who want to live in a time and space oblivion are separated by geography and a timeline. But poetry can be boring.

69,769,769,769,769,Maximum,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review25 Critic Reviews 0.9/5.0,/movie/maximum-review/,0.9/5.0,,,3.9,"The business and underworld of the Indian police department is showcased with style and great performances. But it still feels same-ol' same-ol', just the jobs of the people doing it is the same. ","Maximum is depressing. It looks like a play between two policemen who are neither at the top of the department nor at the lowest ranks, so they do have a decent amount of power each. But indeed, there are many more, more important characters. Like the umpteen underworld films it is not a war between good and evil, or wrong and right. It is just human beings, each being their own shade of gray. That makes for perfect 'enjoyable story' material despite lack of relatable characters you can root for. Yet, once you get over the sadness that overwhelms you while you watch police officers do what goons do, only with more authority, you realize it is just one of those gang war films. And that's the most depressing bit about Maximum. That a war between two policemen is nothing short of a gang war - thematically and morally. Of course, I'm not saying any of what is shown in the film comes as a shock. If there is goonism and business in politics; politics and goonism in business, why should it come as a surprise that there is goonism, business and politics within law enforcement. Yet, it made me uncomfortable when policemen shot goons down because the were the others' informers or when one had to pay another to save an informer. For this discomfort, for some good performances, for a good start, Maximum might be worth your while, if you were looking forward to it.On the other hand, except for the first half hour or so, there is a lot of dramatization, lots of motifs and symbols thrown in your face and many such pitfalls that a director falls in, in trying to do all the cool things in one film. Maximum spreads itself thin even in terms of giving space to its characters. It is always a tough task to do justice to all the main characters even they are in small roles, especially when they are being played by such good actors. From Naseeruddin Shah and Sonu Sood to Dr. Mohan Agashe, Vinay Pathak to Rajendra Gupta, Neha Dhupia, Amit Sadh - each one make you believe in their character. Most of them make you feel for them at some small level, which is a lot for a film that is a 'goon' story at its heart.Even though you cannot be satisfied with exposure given to most of their characters, you appreciate the attempt at giving them some depth. Which is why the lack of detail to Naseeruddin Shah's character, Inamdaar, seems unfair. While you know almost all there is to Sonu Sood's Pandit, there is very little you know of Inamdaar's background, character or motivations. And despite these shortcomings, Maximum plays out well as an interesting story, especially in the beginning where the meat of the story lies. Close to interval, the pace drops and never picks up after that. The soporific background music and constant use of slow-motion doesn't help. Neither does the constant punctuation by item numbers under the guise of the policemen's dance bar visits. I also liked the symbolic survival of innocence, honesty(?) and loyalty.Maximum felt like it had an interesting story to tell but got lost in its way amongst lots of intriguing characters and too many things to tell. A little prioritization might have allowed the writer and director to focus on what the story was about.

Will certainly appeal to the Marathi Manoos.,"Will this film tug the Marathi Manoos' patriotic strings with precision? Oh yeah!.
Did it work for me? Well, not in entirety.Because I'm not the target audience, here. I don't belong to the community that feels marginalized. And that's my biggest complaint against the film. A film with such a strong belief in what it's saying, it could have appealed to a larger audience. So strong is the Marathi flavor that replace this community with another one and it won't work for the Marathi community. This feeling of impotency that one community feels can be easily extrapolated to various segments of society. Sure, there are enough communities other than the Marathas who feel similar aggravation - the situation might be different, but the powerless feeling is similar. Sure, the film talks of the Marathi populace's helplessness as their own doing, and that no one really stopped them from achieving their potential. But this comes and goes away ever so slightly that amongst all the strong dialogues it feels very mild and almost irrelevant. Not to mention that the stereotyping in the first place is heavily exaggerated. These among a few other lesser important things is why the movie doesn't work. Despite the enthusiasm vibrating in the theater. Despite the sloganeering that hushes quickly, so they don't miss the next powerful dialogue. The dialogues and situations are inspiring alright, but will they inspire after one is out of the theater? Unlikely.Because the situations are ultra-unrealistic, the solutions are utopian and over-simplistic. There is no way even a fraction of the solutions implied are workable. Here, the Lage Raho Munnabhai meets Rang De Basanti approach fails because it lacks the former's adaptability and the latter's universal appeal.Almost all the performances are theatrical and you feel like you are watching a play. The staged feeling doesn't leave you for too long. Though, a couple of father-daughter scenes are handled with sensitivity and bring that lump in the throat. Yet, the film's strongest points remain its theatrical dialogues and Marathi Bana style delivery. The strong folk flavor to the music compliments the sentiment of the film too. all together keeps you attentive and entertained. They are dramatic and yet they work. And let me remind you that this is coming from a person who has no patience for over-dramatization and on-the-face loudness. With the strength of its dialogues it engages me in the drama and keeps me there.However, it doesn't get me involved. I still feel like an outsider, unable to relate to or replace any situation with what I've experienced or heard of. Maybe, I've been blessed with environments where I've never been stereotyped against. The film also made me wonder if there is any community I feel a sense of belonging towards. Couldn't think of any. Except maybe women. Maybe, some day a moviemaker will make a movie about the marginalization against reviewers and I'll feel like hooting and whistling from the audience. Yeah, yeah, I know the irony. The contradiction in first serving us the hyperbolic, sorry state of the Marathi population and then repeatedly listing one Maharastrian achiever after another in every field is annoying. And at the same time the attempt to replace the word Maratha (from the Marathi community) with Maharastriya (Maharastrian - as in a resident of a state) is commendable but again very subtle amongst the other overwhelming furor doing the rounds.

There is something in it for everyone. The animation is top-notch, story is predictable but entertaining and the voice overs are just superb. A must watch, in theatres and you’ll want to watch it again, once the DVD comes out.","Megamind is fun, humorous, entertaining and a very smart film. It takes the best from movies like - The Incredibles, Shrek & Despicable Me, and presents before us an unlikely hero. A hero we grow to love. It follows the current trending theme that sometimes the bad guys make the best good guys. In addition, Megamind gives a lot of depth to its main character. It also carries some deep messages. It reflects on us about how easily we decide on making someone a hero and some one else a villain without trying to know the person better. How we banish everything that is a little different from our liking, a little - odd, without caring for the consequences it might bear. The movie manages to convey all that in style and humour that makes every minute of it a joy to watch. Every great superhero needs a great super-villain. This movie explores the reverse theory that every great villain needs a superhero to oppose him too. And when there is none, evil gets bored, and there are little things more dangerous than an empty mind.The voice-overs are superb. Will Ferrell and Tina Fey have done an outstanding job. Brad Pitt is excellent in his relatively small stint in the movie. And Jonah Hill manages to pull of a dorky voice quite well. Apart from the background score, I also loved the selection of classic hit songs of the 70s and 80s. They couldn’t have been used better and added a lot of mischief to the characters. Its everything you could ask for in a family/kids entertainer.The movie is nothing you haven’t seen before. But, it is a beautiful compilation of the best parts from your favourite movies. Its a Christmas treat to watch with your family and have some unadulterated fun.

I didn't need to think twice before replying, ""can't have too many thoughts after watching it.

Of course, it's over-generalization, but I'm talking of those specific movies with very loose characterizations and even looser transformation of these characters. The kind where the makers thought they are being blasphemous if they didn’t present us with a badly choreographed song, with worse writing and cookie-cutter music every 10 minutes. Very rarely do I allow myself to judge a movie in the first few frames. But sappy, long, unwieldy words of gratitude from the director to everyone he felt thankful to, one after the other, did it for me. Now, the actual first few frames of the movie reaffirmed the cyncism. Aerial shots of a four-horse chariot running wild on brown pasture lands. This could look beautiful, but here it just doesn't. Bouts of directorial creativity surface every once in a while, only for you to wish they didn't. Because they are in the form of a two lips touching awkwardly (not kissing!) under a...table fountain!! Or picture this - yetannuder romantic number playing. Manisha Koirala is upto some random dance, suddenly one of her palms faces camera with her lover's name written on it and a red mark on the little-finger edge of the palm.

Revisit the glory of the first film in this third part of the franchise that almost lives up to its expectations.","Men in Black 3 has all the reasons to remind you why you loved the first film. It’s revives the same recipe that made Men in Black  such a success over a decade ago: many laugh-out-loud moments, roaring chemistry between actors, a nemesis worth his salt and a film that doesn’t solely rely on VFX heavy sequences to define action.Men in Black 3 is uninhibited, the chemistry between Jones and Smith is crackling and the movie makes you feel nostalgic about the last time you were in the theatre watching the first part. (I’m deliberately excluding the 2nd part of the series; let’s just call that one a derailed attempt.)This time around, Agent J is sent back in time to 1969 to prevent their nemesis Boris the Animal, (crazy and convincing alien performance by Jemaine Clement) from killing Agent K. This task lies at the fundamental of restoring the agency’s security, which is now headed by Agent O (Emma Thompson). This leap back in time involves Smith jumping from a 40-storied bulding in New York, and don’t we all just love that? Well, that was just the beginning. The next few hours of the film will have you duly entertained, not majorly because of a hooking plot but the growing relationship between Agent J and a younger Agent K (played by Josh Brolin). Brolin as a younger K is absolutely bang-on with his mannerisms and you find yourself wondering in awe if he was ever a choice for the original role of Agent K. Smith is his usual humorous self, and their growing friendship plays out as a backdrop to the dire need to save K from a snarling and menacing Borris.Back in the 60s, you find yourself convinced that a time-leap has been made. The set, costumes and characteristics are infact, very 60s. Unlike the first film however, where the charm lay in its unpredictable humour that caught you off-guard, Men in Black 3 possesses a subtle version of that same humour. You do find yourself being engrossed with the happenings, mostly by the contrasts between the two characters (Brolin is serious and unaware, and Smith is constantly jabbering), but you do find yourself always hoping for more, for the plot/characters/action to jump that extra mile. Which they don't.Much like the first film, you are rewarded with action-packed fight sequences and the right amount of special effects, although the 3D seemed a bit forceful and could be done away with. Men in Black 3 is a must watch for those of you loved the first film – its a rightful journey of nostalgia. For those of you who haven’t followed the series – watch the film for Will Smith, who’s always a stellar performer, and for a reminder of how fantasy films were made in the 90s.

Otherwise, it is the usual Priyadarshan fare.","Just in case the title of the movie doesn't arouse your skepticism about the quality of humor in the movie, the promos must have. No? Then rest assured the opening sequence will put your eternal optimism to rest. What with a bikini clad woman walking on to the shore of a beach. And Om Puri monkeying around in a black and red magician suit-meets-superhero costume is the final signature. Believe me, you cannot imagine how it hurts to use Om Puri and monkeying together in the same sentence. I must admit that the basic concept of letting the elderly have a life of their own and caring for them is very sweet. But, somehow the crassness with which it is done, did not gel with me. A son (Akshaye Khanna) yelling at his father (Paresh Rawal), in the name of comedy can work once or twice, but throughout? Not happening. Also, a father dreaming of his son finding love is only natural. Call me conservative, but him imagining the possible daughter-in-law (Genelia D'Souza) getting wet under a waterfall and getting all suggestive for his son is just not cool. Add to that a shirtless Om Puri being shrieked at by shrill Archana Puran Singh. How can we be expected to laugh at any of this?So yeah, Paresh Rawal, like always, tries to bring life to the trying-so-hard-to-make-you-laugh lines with his comic timing. This time is no better or no worse than others. Akshaye Khanna is screaming intolerably at the top of his voice half the time, which is like 75 minutes. And is it only me who thinks his dialogue delivery is going from bad to worse with each movie? He actually had extra pauses where none were warranted at a couple of places. Genelia looks pretty and plays her casual character alright. Whether she's acting or just the way she is in real life, we'll know only after she is 3-4 movies old. The lyrics and music of the songs are as generic as could be. Also the choreographer had the lead pair finish their gym/aerobic workout on set. And use of bikini-clad women for no particular reason has never been so blatant. So, cutting the songs out could only have helped the movie. Same goes for about another 15-20 minutes of the movie. There are unnecessary pauses and long dialogues which do nothing but elongate the runtime. What was the point of having the entire crew go to Kerala when neither did the script need Kerala, nor did they manage to capture her intrinsic beauty. I still think that humor is a nice way to portray a father-son relationship. But, I just don't understand why it has to be loud, long and lousy.

In fact, the way characters fall in and out of love in Mere Brother Ki Dulhan, it is clear that the film doesn't want us to take it or any of its characters seriously. The basic idea is to have fun, other things, like logic, etc can wait for another film. And so you go with the writer's definition of what love is - spending some good fun time together. Thankfully, the ""fun"" part is enjoyable. And it is only because of Katrina Kaif. It's like she just cut herself loose. You can sense all the stiff body language, awkwardness and self-consciousness in her films so far, when you see how freely she's breathing here. This freedom also is helped by the fact that there are no serious moments in the film, even when her character is in pretty much deep sh!t. So, that saves her from having to emote anything other than a cheerful face. Within that though, she aces her comic timing. The rest of the cast, including Imran Khan, look like mere pawns that are necessary to create context for her to be jubilant. Even so, while Imran Khan goes about the motions of being awed by the stunning Katrina Kaif, Ali Zafar progressively kills bits of interest you can have in his character, with every time that he opens his mouth. The accent, the mannerisms, the body language are all annoyingly over-the-top. Also, the story is structured such that it revolves around Katrina Kaif's character Dimple. Her free spirit attracts everyone around her to her. Sure, the dialogue is witty and there are enough laughs in there for one and all, but anyone who has seen the trailer, or even heard the title of the film, knows how the film is going to end. And that is exactly why, we won't get involved in the story. We don't invest too much attention on the story because we know by hook or crook, the inevitable is going to happen. I won't say the writers haven't tried to make the ""how they get there"" part interesting. They try and even succeed a bit in the earlier parts of the film. But as the film progresses, the situation gets more and more ridiculous. And you begin to feel the climax is being postponed unnecessarily. Other fillers like songs break in abruptly, but the music and especially the lyrics are entertaining. Also, the picturization - that is the dances and colors used for costumes/art work make the screen look vibrant and full of energy. I didn't think a day would come when I'd say that the only thing going for a film is Katrina Kaif. Take her out and the film collapses because the material is weak. Mere Brother Ki Dulhan starts with asking me to believe that an outgoing, flirtatious guy is convincing his brother to look for a wife for him and has in it everything from social pressure by families to gullible parents who are being played around by their children. They try to use wit in weird situations the characters get themselves into; they succeed partially, but it is difficult to overlook the overall disregard to sense or rather overt respect for nonsense.

It is laced with some hilarious one-liners and tries to be hep with youngistan lingo, but is ultimately predictable and generally silly.","Films which start out with a lie and then build up on that lie with more lies explode in a typical fashion and thus are predictable in that sense. Mere Dad Ki Maruti too, falls in that category, and doesn't get too creative with the lies either. However, some witty one-liners and that it gets a couple more lead characters involved in its lies keeps the going slightly more engaging than otherwise. That too though, goes missing in the last quarter of the film. The co-conspirators suddenly vanish for a while and reappear. We are to assume they were busy hatching alternate plans. Watching Sameer (Saqib Saleem) dig his grave deeper all by himself gets a little weary. His motivations seem dramatic and convoluted. This is saved, to a great extent, by some very sharp dialogue writing. Sameer who is constantly put down by his father and sister gets back at them in his own way, if only under his breath. However, like his friend (Prabal Punjabi) points out, he is way too casual about the supposedly alarming situation he is in. Such is his contribution in keeping things light. Saqib Saleem, Prabal Punjabi and Rhea Chakraborty together keep the film young with their SMSese. I didn't find all of that too amusing, felt a bit over-done. But, then again maybe I'm too old to find this funny. The dialogue delivery is too fast, maybe in keeping with the fast-paced lives that the young and restless live.  The other one-liners though are witty and come and go quickly, keeping the audience on its toes to stay with the flow. The Punjabi bit is a tad too in-the face. So is Ram Kapoor as Sameer's dad. It doesn't help that we have no clue why Sameer is being put down so bad by him, and his sister for that matter. All you hear is this putting-down and suddenly you are supposed to believe that 'it's all for the family' after all. In this family affair then, why-o-why did a cheap dance, performed by a bride, find place? If it is to exaggerate of how ridiculously offending lyrics find their way to family events, it is in bad taste. Such things with a quick anti-dowry pointer just don't gel together. Even so, Mere Dad Ki Maruti is a decent watch while you are at it. It gives you a couple hearty laughs and you smile more often than not. Oh and be prepared for an extra dose of Maruti advertisement in the first half hour. Then again, you were already warned, weren't you?

Same story and yet so charming.","That feeling when you are transported into another world. That. Meri Pyaari Bindu gives you that feeling. It is not a fairy tale, not by a long shot. It is not fantasy. It is actually quite real. Where the heart wants what it wants and you know not why. When the heart doesn't want what you think it should want and you know not why. Sure, the feeling doesn't stay through the film, but it sticks around for most of it. The childhood bits in the film are quite jarring. The manner in which little Bindu calls little Bubla over seems too grown-up. But then, it might be what Bubla remembers and that might be just fair enough. Because Meri Pyaari Bindu is clearly Bubla's (Ayushman Khurana) point of view. And the actor makes Bubla very real. He is enamoured by Bindu. Though you don't know why, you feel he is justified because of the way he is. It matters little who Bindu is and what she is like. Bindu's (Parineeti Chopra) confusion, on the other hand, is all too familiar in the new-age Hindi rom-coms at least. The woman stands her own but she doesn't really know what she wants, she is free and full of life. She might seem and be directionless too. But she is comfortable with that. Parineeti Chopra brings all of this to life and more. Bindu's vulnerability is as apparent as her mischevious self. The gripe could be that we don't get a proper peek into her confusion. It makes the story half-told and leaves you wanting to know more. But, that would be another film because this is Bubla's story. His unfulfilling journey through this love.You go back and forth in time with Bubla as he sifts through the pages of the new book he is writing; through an mix audio tape that he recorded with Bindu that takes him back in time and brings him back to the present day. While this non-linear narration doesn't come in the way of our entertainment, it still feels like an escape by the writers. It does seem like they came up with a baseline boy-meets-girl story, a few scenes and they moved the scenes around till they found an interesting flow. Similarly, while the voiceover feels completely justified in the beginning, there is no real use for its overuse through the film. But, it doesn't come in the way of how engaged you are with the film. I didn't mind this gimmickry though. Because except for a few sequences here and there, I was hooked to Bubla's feelings. The dialogue is meaningful and relatable. Not in a “quote of the day” kind of a way but still insightful. The laughs are frequent and the hindi film references are absolutely perfect. Right to the reference to today's other release, Sarkar 3. Otherwise, these nods to olden times seem forced and take your attention away from the main story. Here, they blend with the story and add to it. The climax is one of the most satisfying ones in a long time. It might or might not be the one you are hoping for, but it rings true.Also, this must be the first film in which I enoyed the peppy number better than the romantic ones. Sure, it was out of place in the flow of the film and existed just because it had to be there by Hindi movie standards. Nevertheless, fun it was. The lyrics of the other songs are soulful too. Meri Pyaari Bindu is that rom-com that doesn't offer much new, but it still engages, entertains and makes you sob for you remembered that one heartbreak that took your faith in relationships away from you.

Nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars (2006), Golden Globes and BAFTA Awards, this film features an exciting ensemble cast who chip in with great performances. Gripping, touching and has a wonderful message.","There’s something about music from the bagpipes, isn’t it? Think Mel Gibson’s Braveheart and you can faintly recollect its sound. There’s an amazing pathos in the notes it produces. Something which a film like Joyeux Noel (Merry Christmas) has in plenty. One of the remarkable features about watching Merry Christmas is that when the movie is on, there are scenes that scream out to you that this indeed is great cinema unfolding in front of you. I felt so the first time I watched it at the MAMI Film Festival some years ago, where the film received a standing ovation. On DVD, I not only relived that experience - I was moved to tears, yet again in many scenes - I also realised that this film has one of the finest messages about peace and humanity. Ideally, this movie should have released in India. In a country where J P Dutta’s Border was such a success, Merry Christmas is blockbuster material. Based on a true story, the film is set during a Christmas eve in the first World War, when Scottish, German and French soldiers on the Western Front set aside their differences and declared ceasefire for one night to celebrate Christmas together. It’s got a simple plot, but it is the moving screenplay and the a wonderful star-cast that makes the film so watchable. It also has one of the most uplifting background scores - it plays a crucial role in conveying the soldiers’ emotions. Music, in fact plays a vital role in the film - it is what unites the soldiers and proves that no matter which country you’re from, those notes emanating from the bagpipes and mouth organs can blur any dividing lines. And the story sets a fantastic example of religion - Christianity - acting as a great unifier, rather than a divide between people. The story also makes a strong point about European countries’ culture and heritage, whose roots are more or less similar. The scale of how important the film is understood by the number of languages the film touches. There’s English (with a heavy Scottish accent), German and French. The proximity of each of these countries is depicted through some wonderful interludes between the soldiers - someone knows a relative or two on the other side, letters are passed on, promises are made to visit them after the war, there are invitations to come over for a drink, compliments are passed about the others' wives and you witness all of this with a lump in your throat, because you sense that they may not survive this battle together. How will they get back to shooting at each other the next morning? That’s the irony on which the storyline balances itself and sends out a strong message that despite being divided by man-made borders, humanity essentially has some simple needs - caring about our loved ones, wanting to be with our families during festivals and  the right to live a good life and get a decent funeral. Director Christian Carion, a Frenchman himself proves that he is a fine director of an ensemble starcast. That comprises of the outstanding French lieutenant Audebert (Guillame Canet), the Bishop Palmer (Gary Lewis) who doubles up as a doctor on the Scottish army camp, the suave Scottish chief Gordon (Alex Ferns) and the impressive Horstmayer (Daniel Bruhl), who’s a Jew leading the German camp, but still celebrates Christmas with as much fervour as the others. There are two opera icons Sprink (Benno Furmann) and Anna Sorensen (Diane Kruger), who help give form to the cease fire, through their singing. It’s a memorable watch and after you’ve seen it, there’s a sense of fulfillment that very few movies are able to produce. 'I’m Dreaming of Home', the theme song is something you’ll be humming long after the film is over.

Irrfan Khan and Konkona Sen Sharma show versatility by succeeding at comedy too. The script has nice, consistent characters. And the songs have good lyrics too (for a change!). Unfortunately, everything is ruined by the most inept climax, leaving the audience with a sour after taste.","Did the whole world change while I was on vacation? Or maybe I am just naïve. When did the singular motto of every married person become to try and have an extra-marital affair? And even if that happened, do we really need to blame a city for our promiscuity? However, once you get past these two basic plot premises, you begin to appreciate the performances and the flashes of clever dialogue. The most remarkable achievement of the director and the actors is the chemistry between each couple, whichever part of the triangle they are. Be it - revulsion, indifference, love, intimacy - all emotions convey (at most times) what the character feels. Also, the characters are pretty consistent, which is an achievement in itself. And Irrfan Khan and Konkona Sen Sharma playing comic relief is so refreshing! They keep the mood light whenever the other characters start taking themselves too seriously, giving the required impetus whenever the pace begins to slacken. Shilpa Shetty gives an elegant performance and Kay Kay Menon plays to perfection the-guy-you-would-love-to-hate. And we are back to a suicidal Kangna Ranaut, but at least this time around, she looks good. Sharman Joshi's talent desperately needs to be treated with meatier roles. And somehow, the Dharmendra-Nafisa Ali track seemed very forced and contrived, especially because of the shabby treatment their dialogues were given.The movie starts off with some brilliant lines that almost sound like poetry, but soon enough doze off to inane-land. Thereafter, the brilliance is pretty much sporadic. Similarly, the lyrics are a welcome change from the nonsense we have been served in the name of poetry, of late. They reflect the mood of the characters and flow well with the overall situations. However, all the songs sound like they have been composed by a rock band. Which would have been tolerable but for the picturization. In an attempt to avoid lip-synching they went overboard. Give me the unnecessary songs, with barely-clad men and women dancing for me, I will take that. But, three men - none of whom have seen a comb or a razor in the past year, but know a lot about greasing curly locks - coming at me like objects do in a 3-D show, in every single song. Not done! Even in the name of fashion.It is the climax of movies that do not have any particular purpose in mind that can make or break the movie. And the culmination fails here big time. It feels like the writer got bored towards the end and just wanted to get it done with one way or the other. If not for the cumbersome climax, the movie might have been well worth a watch. But, alas...

83,783,783,783,783,Metropolis,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review3 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/metropolis-review/,,4/5.0,,3.833333333,"Fritz Lang’s Metropolis is Adolf Hitler’s favourite film. If that doesn’t tickle your interest, perhaps the mind-boggling special effects in the film will. For a film made in 1926, Lang’s technique, story and morals portrayed were not only apt for a world embracing industrialisation, but are also fit to today’s context where the divide between capitalists and the working class is only getting wider.","Non-Hindi, black and white films - especially silent ones - often receive mixed reactions if you watch them on TV. I’ve lived with roommates - film enthusiasts all of them - and believe me, unless you’re the true blue movie buff, a silent film is last on the ‘must watch’ list. Metropolis, made in 1927, is however no ordinary silent film. It shares two reputations - one, of being the most expensive silent film ever made. And two, of being Adolf Hitler’s favourite film. But to really appreciate Fritz Lang’s dystopian drama, you have to acknowledge the incredible amount of effort and global collaboration that has gone into making its most recent version on DVD. Edited parts of the film are patched together from South America, some parts in Europe and some are still lost in transit. Signs of it are visible in the film - for example, the text that flows between images sometimes appears in a different font. There are several abrupt cuts and it is easy to make out that certain sequences are compensated for with text. Fortunately, none of that doesn’t take away the awe of watching Metropolis. Fritz Lang’s technique to shoot the bustling metropolis amazed me and it is sheer genius to create a believable city using miniatures like that. There are floods, explosions, transformations, robots and more - and despite the absence of sophisticated technology for special effects, Lang makes a futuristic city look far more believable than Love Story 2050. Crowd movements for example, are so painstakingly shot that you realise how easy filmmakers have it today. The plot is almost Orwellian, but the message is not. The film unfolds like a science experiment. The point the film wants to make is stated at the beginning: “The mediator between the mind and hands must be the heart.” It must have been a timely one then - almost a prophecy for an era when the Industrial Revolution had begun and the divide between the capitalists and working class was beginning to show. Which is why, the film is hailed as a classic - today, the gap between the rich and poor is the widest it has ever been. In the film, this gap is demonstrated using the upper city, which represents all the luxuries that a man could want - gyms, libraries, playgrounds; while the lower city (the depths), has the working class living in pure apathy. It’s only when the city chief’s (Joh Frederson) son Freder falls in love with a working class woman (Maria), that he realises that he must mediate the differences between his capitalist father (who runs the city) and its workers. The film has just the right amount of layers in its drama - there’s tension between the father (Joh) and son, Freder; there’s the scientist Rotwang who appears obedient to Joh, but has other tricks up his sleeve; and there’s the Machine Man (a replica of Maria, only more menacing and evil) who does all things possible - including an erotic dance number - to destroy the unity of working classes. It’s a silent film, but the actors on screen do enough with their expressions to break the language and sound barrier. Brigitte Helm, who plays Maria and the Machine Man, is the best of the lot. She seems divine as Maria, but her raised eyebrow look as Machine Man is, well, pure evil. Gustav Frohlich, as the saviour, Freder is impressive. Alfred Abel as Joh Fredersen, the capitalist tycoon is very unlike a silent film actor - he’s not loud, yet a twitch of his facial muscles does more than a dose of invectives would. Rudolf Ken Rogge plays the mad scientist Rotwang to perfection.Some may interpret Metropolis as preachy, but I think it does so through an engaging story. It advocates themes of non-violence and responsible industrialization. If not for the message, watch this film to get some insights into what touches the mind of Adolf Hitler.

It was nominated for seven Oscars, and to be fair, it’s not hard to see why.Director (and writer) Tony Gilroy keeps the action low but the tension high in this well-paced legal thriller. Gilroy’s previous writing credits include the ‘Bourne’ series and ‘Devil’s Advocate’, but with ‘Michael Clayton’ he gets to assume the director’s chair and shape the movie to his liking. George Clooney gives a strong performance in the title role, playing a corporate lawyer increasingly torn between loyalty to his friend and colleague (Arthur Eden, played by Tom Wilkinson) and to his employers. Things are further complicated by Clayton’s fractured personal life – seemingly de rigueur for male Hollywood protagonists these days. Although he didn’t win this time around, if Clooney keeps putting in these performances (and stays clear of more ‘Oceans’ movies) he’s likely to land an Oscar sooner or later, and although the role of Michael Clayton isn’t as meaty as say, Bob Barnes in 2005’s ‘Syriana’, there’s still plenty for him to work with.The film is set mainly in New York City, although we get to see completely different side of the city to that we see in American Gangster, for example. Here, the villains are – for the most part – tucked away in their skyscraper offices, part of the sinister system so lucidly described by Wilkinson’s Arthur in the film’s fabulous opening monologue.Perhaps the best word to describe the movie is ‘understated’. There are no actors chewing the scenery here. Instead, there are solid performances throughout the cast. Particular credit goes to Tom Wilkinson as Arthur and the excellent Sydney Pollack as Clayton’s sympathetic boss. Tilda Swinton does a fine job of portraying senior lawyer Karen Crowder, struggling to maintain a cool façade despite the pressures upon her. With George Clooney and his ‘Ocean’s Eleven’ pal Steven Soderbergh both credited as Executive Producers, perhaps it’s no surprise that ‘Michael Clayton’ looks slick. Expensive yes, but not flashy – in keeping with the tone of the movie. Similarly, the subtle soundtrack (a chord-heavy piano score) suits the mood well. Again, it’s slick.Gilroy touches on some interesting themes. We’re reminded that the role of the lawyer is to represent their client – not necessarily see that justice is done. But at what cost, and where to draw the line?There are layers here too, as Gilroy lightly plays with a fantasy sub plot. However, Gilroy keeps the main story within the realms of possibility. In a post-Bhopal world – where ‘cost-benefit analysis’ acts as corporate doublespeak for profits over human life – is the film’s U-North any different from Union Carbide? Similar ground has been covered before – most recently in Michael Mann’s ‘The Insider’ (1998) but Gilroy manages to keep things fresh while simultaneously harking back to some of the great American thrillers of the 1970s. And of course, they picked up a few Oscars too…

From facebook and twitter to use of words like backspace and escape in regular dialogue, Mickey Virus goes overboard just to make an impact, to squeeze a laugh out of you. Unfortunately, it is also the big picture that you walk out of the theater with. It is a shame then that Mickey Virus has enough material in its cute, albeit illogical story to have made a good comic thriller.From the slogan t-shirt to the one-liners, the film seems like its writing department's only aim was to impress with its wit in every single line - at least in the first half. The adrenaline rush seems to settle down post-interval, which is when the relentless onslaught of absolutely ridiculous computer jargon begins. Wires, USB sticks, random computer screens take over with a vengeance.More unfortunately than fortunately, Mickey Virus does have a decent story hiding behind all this mumbo-jumbo. Our man, Mickey (Manish Paul), a rockstar, computer hacker is roped in by the police to solve a cyber crime. He gets himself into a very tight spot around interval. By then, you have warmed up to his personality and you really want him to come out unscathed and want to know how he does it too. Alas, the weave gets so messy that you lose interest. It almost feels like its written by a 16-year old who is trying his hand at a story for the first time. In that sense, the movie is a good first attempt. But ultimately, it is pretty juvenile. This is besides the mind-numbing number of loopholes in the details. Thankfully though, the lead performance is pretty mature. It does require talent to portray a believable, charming, good-for-nothing buffoon. This, Manish Paul manages pretty well. Soon enough, he has to go into a serious, scared mode which he makes you believe too. The rest of the cast ain't bad either. In comedies like these, I am just thankful they aren't too loud. That relative restraint itself is applaud-worthy. How I wish some of that restraint was shown in filling the film up with romantic numbers that do not belong. Well I know, that is always too much to ask for. Having had a decent broad story and a good lead actor on board, Mickey Virus ought to have dived a little deeper to make for a thriller we could laugh with. It's as if the makers were either too lazy or too scared to fill in the details with smart content.  They opt for stuff that is so out there that no one will take the film seriously. This too would've been fine, if it were done in moderation. Mickey Virus does come across as a film that the makers weren't entirely comfortable with. There are sparks that indicate they would've rather made it an all-out thriller. The comedy bits seem like an outer cover, an after thought, even. Yet, it is great to see a comic thriller being attempted. A brainless comedy with some direction is better than one that hams aimlessly, any day.

86,786,786,786,786,[A] Mighty Heart,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review2 Reader Reviews 1/5.0,/movie/a-mighty-heart-review/,,1/5.0,,2.5,,"Based on Marianne Pearl’s book of the same name, A Mighty Heart focuses on the events surrounding the immediate aftermath of the kidnapping of Pearl’s husband, fellow-journalist and Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl (played by Dan Futterman).When he went missing, Daniel was in Karachi – where most of the film is set – to investigate extremist links to British national Richard Reid, the infamous failed ‘shoe bomber’, jihadist and Guantanamo detainee. The film essentially documents the combined attempts of the Pakistani security forces, US intelligence services, Daniel’s colleagues and Marianne herself to find Daniel and has captors.Marianne (played by Angelina Jolie) is unwilling to be a victim of circumstance: she is proactive, passionate and fiery as she attempts to unravel the tangled web of contacts, fixers and middlemen in the quest to locate her husband.Director Michael Winterbottom faces a challenge, which he deals with admirably: to combine both reconstruction and dramatisation. For the former, Winterbottom uses several techniques giving the film a ‘fly on the wall’ documentary quality, such as heavy use of handheld camera shots, along with datelines and interspersed contemporary news footage. For the latter, he keeps up the tempo through the editing – quick cuts between shots, jump cuts and pacy visuals. The combination of documentary style visuals and action thriller pacing is definitely in vogue right now – The Bourne Ultimatum stands as a prime example.Anurag Kashyap also had a crack with Black Friday, but A Mighty Heart succeeds where Black Friday ultimately failed. Whereas many of the sequences in Black Friday would have worked as dramatisations within a documentary, as a film it fell down because of the lack of genuine characterisation or cohesive narrative.A Mighty Heart manages to pull this off. This is definitely Marianne’s story – not Daniel’s – and we’re firmly placed in her shoes throughout. Winterbottom resists the temptation either to dramatise or speculate about Daniel Pearl’s incarceration itself. Following Daniel’s disappearance, the emphasis is firmly on Marianne’s desperate search, and we see him only in flashbacks or photographs. Just like Marianne, we have to learn the truth piece by piece as the story unfolds.As with Black Friday and Steven Spielberg’s Munich, A Mighty Heart avoids over-simplistic cartoonish characterisations of the ‘bad guys’. This adds to the realism; even jihadists have families too.Much has been said about Jolie’s portrayal of Marianne. Is she the right actress for the part? To be fair, Jolie deserves credit for her performance. She puts in a strong emotional turn in an undoubtedly challenging role, and is certainly less irritating than usual. Without her influence (and that of her husband, co-producer Brad Pitt) it’s unlikely that the film would have been made in the first place.Although Jolie is the star name, the film benefits from balanced and understated performances from across the cast. In particular, the ever-reliable Irrfan Khan is excellent as Captain, the Pakistani CID officer leading the investigation. Futterman has relatively little screen time, but convinces, as does Archie Panjabi as Marianne’s friend and hostess Asra – who as an Indian in Pakistan faces problems of her own.Winterbottom occasionally lapses into cliché – is it possible to signify a new day in Pakistan without panning across a hazy dawn skyline accompanied by the cry of the muezzin? It seems not. As soon as we leave the haven of Asra’s lavish Karachi bungalow we’re pitched immediately into the apparent chaos of downtown Karachi. Yet while Karachi’s traffic might seem threatening to many – and is presumably used as a device to unsettle the audience – it would not faze Daniel Pearl, an experienced journalist who lived and worked in Bombay.As an adaptation of a non-fiction book, A Mighty Heart may not have the luxury of a conventional plot. However, the film demonstrates that with care and attention to detail it is possible to produce an intelligent, thought-provoking dramatisation without resorting to sensationalist flourishes. Fittingly, like Marianne and Daniel, A Mighty Heart has dignity.

Unfortunately, the engaging situations are detailed with lame lines and the good performances are packaged in tacky overalls.","A city-bred girl wants to make a successful career out of being a housewife. Her ultimate goal is to mother two kids. Fair enough, that's plausible. The same city breeds this guy who has had an easy life and makes the most out of it by drinking, smoking, and lying. Acceptable. Destiny brings them together. Credible. Answers to how, when, where, are all creative and borderline believable, especially when you accept your fate of having to face cinematic liberty in all its glory. And yet, these parts don't add up to a 'must watch' or even a 'will watch some time.'When you have destiny as your excuse, nothing really needs to make logical sense, right? Weird, whacky coincidences happen all the time. And despite that, the Milenge Milenge writers have gone to laborious lengths (about 50 minutes) to make a 'chance meeting' happen. That effort we have to acknowledge. But, the trouble is with the unevenness. Amit and Priya get some things so easily and predictably. Some transformations of people around them happen without any effort or reason. But then again, who are we to expect fate to deal an even hand. With romantic Hindi films, you can usually tell within the first 15-20 minutes which direction the film is headed and what are the possible climaxes. It's just the 'how you get there' part that makes it interesting. And that is done with a few decent and engaging anecdotes here. But, the other part of the how, the visuals, the feel of the film is like that of a fabric that irritates the skin. Primitive camera work, Hindi soap-opera-type background score, Himesh-Reshammiya-style nasal title score running through the film, inane lyrics, music from the 90s, kitschy dialogues for otherwise interesting situations, other situations which are lame on their own merit, and more such stuff - add up to a ""when will this chase to meet be over?"" feel. And this is extremely sad because Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor actually do a decent enough job. The playfulness and pain comes through as much as the script allows it to. And you begin rooting for the couple, but Milenge Milenge's script actually doesn't let you get that involved. Especially in the latter half, an arm's length distance is maintained between the audience and the characters. Yet, it'd be unfair if I wrote the film off completely. I have a feeling that as superficial as the story is, it connected to me, maybe by just a thread, but it did. And who knows, it might just have worked in the days of (Jab We Met.

89,789,789,789,789,Milk,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/milk-review/,,,,3.25,"Watch Sean Penn in one of his best performances, as a political gay activist. He’s meticulous, touching and while you might not cry, you’ll want to Google all about Harvey Milk. ","I had never cried as much as I did while watching I Am Sam. I was warned, and I still went ahead thinking it’s a 2 hour film. I’ll shed a few tears, what else? Tears were an understatement, is all I’ll say, for those 2 hours. So when I picked up Milk to review, I channeled out everything I had heard about the film. There’s just something else about watching a film post its Oscar hype, to be able to agree, disagree, dismiss or confirm the conclusions people made of the film. Or better so, to make your own. Gus Van Sant’s Milk is a biopic on Harvey Milk, a gay rights activist. Sean Penn gives a powerful performance, as a 40 year-old gay man who moves to San Francisco from New York with his boyfriend Scoot Smith (James Franco). Set in the 1950s, the couple open a camera shop in the neighborhood, and before he can realize,  Milk finds himself fighting for gay rights. The film captures a true essence of undercurrent of the bubbling homosexuality, and explores how San Francisco became the gay capital. Here we see a strain in relationships, as Milk moves. After having run for Board of Supervisors, 3 years in a row, he finally gets elected, where we see him shift from being a nervous, closeted man to a public-speaking, motivational national figure. All this, however, happens at a cost. He meets eccentric lovers, who behave as pit stops for his political career: Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch), a fellow community organizer, followed by Jack Lira (Diego Luna), a Mexican-American who becomes jealous of Milk’s advancing career. This is my first problem with the film. It relies on formulaic story-telling that pre-supposes it’s only plot-points to be a conflict between the personal and professional. On one side we have a transformation happening, we see an individual’s journey so beautifully played by Penn, but when interspersed with a preachy sub-text about neurotic relationships, it becomes a bit monotonous.That is until we come to Dan White. One of Milk’s most crucial relationships, White was a conservative Catholic man who considered homosexuality a sin. An alcoholic, White (played by Josh Brolin, of No Country for Old Men fame) becomes Milk’s biggest and most tragic hurdle. Their complexity, and powerful whiplash of personalities is so intensely carved out, it almost swirls you in. As a fictional biopic, the DVD has some phenomenal extras. It almost serves as a mini-visual autobiography of Harvey Milk, with a small docu called Remembering Harvey, where noted political figures of the time speak about him, deleted scenes – with a brilliant extended version of Milk’s first public speech and ‘Marching for Equality’ – a behind-the-scenes look at the various marches, protests and real-life events through San Francisco that Milk had fought for. Definitely a DVD worth investing in.Milk isn’t about a flawless political hero. It’s a personal account of motivation, hurdles, and an imperfect yet touching story that had to be told. In any which way possible.

90,790,790,790,790,Minnale,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/minnale-review/,,3/5.0,,2.75,"There’s a 2-minute scene in Minnale that aptly describes the entire film. In it, Madhavan is stuck in a phone booth in the rain, when he happens to see Reemma Sen play and dance with street kids. He can’t see her face at first, but with a stroke of lightning, he happens to catch a glimpse. And that’s when he knows – he’s fallen madly in love with her. He can’t explain it – it’s as random, forceful and hard-hitting as the very stroke of lightning. The film is very similar – it’s pure and it brings you anticipated joy. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself randomly twatting your toes in the air after the film; I know I did. ","I remember Minnale (Lightning) being the first Tamil film I attempted to watch without subtitles. I’ll be honest and tell you the only reason I did it is because I’ve seen the Hindi remake some 100 times (Rehna Hai Tere Dil Mein). My heroic act fell flat with fervor with a fellow Tamilian friend’s wise words – “I hope you’re not watching a Gautam Menon film without subtitles. Half the movie is English anyway.”There's a point behind me bringing out this incident – Gautam Menon is household name now in most parts of South India with films like Kakka Kakka, VinnaiThandi Varuvaya and Varanam Aayiram. His films work because they have a certain universal quality to it, but they still manage to retain the socio-cultural flavor of his roots. Minnale, however, is very different from his later films, which have strong themes and hard-cutting performances. It’s a simple, run-off-the-mill story about a guy who tries to woo a girl he saw once and fell in love with. One of Madhavan’s earlier films, in Minnale, he plays his most charming role. Genuinely smitten by Reena (Reemma Sen), he convinces you about his mad love, while the camera runs up and down with him on a road, like a love-struck maniac and even more so, when he wants to pull his hair out because he’s “whipped”, to put it colloquially. This portrayal works because, for a film released in 2000, for once we see romance staying away from cheesy songs with loud expressions. This is achieved mainly because every performance, by Madhavan, Reemma or Aabas is believable and fresh. Through the film you feel like you’re listening to a ""how-this-happened"" story that a friend tells you over coffee while you’re catching up after years. It brings that bright smile of anticipation on your face – as you see the film unfold. Personally, I would have preferred a heroine with a brighter face than Reemma Sen. She just has the tendency to look bored sometimes. Madhavan’s witty grandfather Subunni (Nagesh) plays a charming performance as a father figure who supports his feelings with full rigour. Madhavan’s best friend Chokalingam (Vivek) adds a sense of comic relief, something that is central to most South Indian films. The music of the film tells half the story, really. Harris Jayaraj’s first film as a composer is probably his best soundtrack till date. The songs are heart-warming, hummable and go so well with the flavor of the film. The entire package makes you want to wish you were the lead couple, so you could be a part of a romance that is so next-door. When I first picked up the DVD of Minnale, I was a bit alert. While the DVD has no feature as such, after having heard so many people praise a film that was a dud in Hindi, I wanted to mentally compare. Technically, the subtitles in the DVD are comprehensible (yes, I checked) and they help in making you see a sense of purity that the film has incorporated. Simply put, Minnale blew me away. It’s simple, charming and much unlike its Hindi counterpart which borders on a corny, watered down version of the film. Minnale, however, has a very strong personality as a film – like an old, yellowed letter you find written with a blunt pencil.

Thanks to some amazing wit inbuilt into the stories from folklore.","Superficially Mirch is a collection of short stories with an underlying theme of adultery. But while throwing the theme of shameless betrayal on you face, it covers a lot of ground. We are scandalized by the sexually expressive female characters, who rightly call themselves 'bitches'. This shock itself is an example of how inappropriate we think it is for our women to articulate their sexuality, let alone use or act upon their needs. The short stories are replete with sarcasm on the hypocrisy inbuilt in a man-woman relationship - mythology or modern. The double standard also subtly creeps in the audience's mind. For example, without taking offense (I'm a woman and all that), I started making character judgments about the women. Though they were smart and thought on their feet, they were ace-class calculative. Only suddenly, Ruchi (Shahana Goswami) remarks that the stories are pro-women. And it struck me, all the men in the film were equally manipulative. Only their scheming doesn't come into the fore because ...because of what? Stereotypes about men allow them to be devious? Lead ladies are hardly ever portrayed as conspiring in films, unless they are vamps? That's how slyly the film makes you think. The characters argue amongst themselves on our behalf. They shhusssh possible criticism by bringing up objections against the four shorts themselves. The others make counter-arguments. Usually, I get annoyed when films do that. Justify its faults by saying them out loud. But, it slid by here. Mainly because of the content of the shorts. And they had to do something to connect the four dots, right? On the side, Mirch also talks about the struggle of a writer who wants to differ from the standard. In fact, the underlying theme that wit can get you places, applies to this side-plot too. Deftly, writer Maanav (Arunoday Singh), textures his stories in accordance with the producers demands. And while making all these points Mirch is fun to sit through. It could've solely stood tall on the clever stories. But lovely performances and to-the-tee casting only add to the entertainment quotient. I thoroughly enjoyed the colors used to accentuate and differentiate the mood of the setting. The lively colors in the Panchatantra short stories are in complete contrast with the browns and blues in the modern stories. And these are set against the black and whites hues in the connecting segments. Similarly the narrative is lyrical and musical in the folklore portions but is sort-of stone-hearted and harsh for the modern stories. One of the nagging issues with any film that has a few absolutely unconnected parts put together is flow. The connection should not look forced. Mirch just about passes that hurdle. The other bigger concern is the climax. And the conclusion here slithers by like a snake. Left me with a smile and a few questions that I was happy they left unanswered.  Despite the sexual undercurrent, none of the shorts are erotic. They aren't vulgar, but they aren't beautiful either. They made me uncomfortable in the ""too much of one thing makes one sick"" sense. But, that was while watching the film. While walking out, the other things the film was pointing at came one after the other. There was also this pesky question, ""by liking this film am I subscribing to the fact that sex sells?"" :DAlso, while walking out, I overheard a couple. After a longish silence - 
He - Thinking about the movie, no? 
She - Goodness, this is going to make everyone suspicious. 
He - It's a movie one should watch alone. The couple was thinking and discussing. And it struck me - the film also warns you not to get complacent about your relationship.

92,792,792,792,792,Mirror Mirror,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review,/movie/mirror-mirror-review/,,,,3.4,"Mirror Mirror is a kid-friendly film – you can easily substitute this story with the old one while putting your kids to sleep and they would be able to relate to it more, considering we are in 2012. Little more insight, innovation and wit and the film could have been positively path-breaking. As it is, Mirror Mirror is a pleasurable watch. ","Mirror Mirror isn’t a revisit to the age-old fairy-tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, nor is it a satire. The first thing you’ll notice while watching the film is how it’s a celebration of the fairy-tale with a concrete contemporary flavour. Fairy-tales are meant to have a universal moral that is passed on for generations, and Mirror Mirror manages to hold that moral and still give the film an interestingly relatable treatment. Julia Roberts plays the evil queen, and by the look of it, rather enjoys her sinister position of authority. We are told the story through her perspective; you instantly figure out this version of Snow White is going to be entertaining. She plays a vain, insecure queen who locks up an 18 year old Snow White in order to maintain her position. The King is dead, and Snow White (played by Lily Collins) is the rightful ruler of the land, but the Queen is willing to do anything to keep her away. Snow White is no tormented damsel in distress though. She escapes the palace to realize the kingdom is in ruins, where the villagers who once used to sing and dance, are now broke and starving. The fun (or what you would call conflict) begins when Snow White meets the Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer of the Social Network fame) and later we realize the Queen wants to marry him for his money. The interactions between the Queen and the Prince are charming, as you see Roberts behave like a drooling cougar, pouncing on ever opportunity to flirt with him. White, on the other hand, encounters the 7 dwarves in the Forest and together they plot to free the land from the Evil Queen’s hold. Mirror Mirror's strongest point is its elaborate sets and costumes. Colorful landscapes, beefed up gowns and frilly collars give the film a grand and dramatic feel – you feel like every character has come alive from a vibrant children’s story book.  However, Lily Collins and Hammer are rather forgettable in their characters, and their love seems hurried and sugar-coated.The strongest performance (with no surprises) is Julia Roberts’. Even so, the “true love” between Snow White and the Prince isn’t established enough, and Roberts’ could have easily been a tad bit more evil and sassy. The effort to make the film more clever and enjoyable seems laborious and borders on predictable. The film revels in its ability to subvert tradition – in a brilliant scene as a parody to artificial beauty, the queen gets her lip stung by a bee to enhance it. The idea is not to portray that the women were born beautiful but that even Queens and Princesses from fairy-tales need to touch up. The film isn’t laden with preachy deductions but allows you to enjoy a contemporary re-telling - Snow White learns to use a sword in order to fight her own battle, the dwarves aren’t Robin-Hood thieves but actual bandits and the prince is most certainly not a Knight in shining armor. Mirror Mirror is an entertaining weekend watch and something the children will love especially if they are aware of the original fairy-tale. It could have been a shorter, crisper film with memorable dialogues (like a play on stereotypical things that characters from fairy-tales say) but the film has a bunch of moments to keep you engaged.

Pretends to be romantic. Pretends to be enigmatic. Pretends to be Shakespearean – how can it be without the complexity or the tragedy.,"Mirzya is quite meta in its story. It goes the extra mile to prove that a love story stays pretty much the same, through the ages. So, before you as an audience can say, “it's the same old story”, they say it. Only they say it with a lot more jazz. Still means the same to you, you are quite thoroughly bored.Visual finesse can enamour you for a bit. Quirky song picturization can wake you up for those few minutes. Beyond that, Mirzya holds no hook. The tone of the movie is such that you can pretty much guess how it's going to end. The characters have nothing to hold your interest except that the actors playing them look gorgeous. Except Zeenat (played by yet another gorgeous Anjali Patil) who creates intrigue enough to want to see more of it. Her relationship with Monish (Harshvardan Kapoor) seems much deeper than that of his with Suchitra (Saiyami Kher). Why are they in love again? The entire story is a broad stroke. The details are only in the visuals. They grant the film a mysterious feel. But, it is more theatrical than what belongs to a movie. With these, Mirzya reminded me vaguely of Kites, Love Story 2050 and even Drona. And anyone who has seen these films will know it's not a compliment. It is commendable then that the lead actors Harshvardhan Kapoor, Saiyami Kher and Anjali Patil stay restrained. With all the slo-mo in the folklore part of the film, it would have been very easy to go overboard. But those bits are surprisingly only as dramatic or not as a nicely shot, video of a slow-soothing song. I would love to see more of these two. They don't have that woodenness that most beginners have in their first few films. They don't carry airs about how pretty they are. The visualization takes care of calling undue attention to itself. And the music. Sure, the movie would have been an absolute dud if it were not for the music. And even so, the songs felt out of place every single time, including the title song. However, I can listen to the songs on loop all day, for a few days.But, what good is a service to the eyes and ears without any attempt to engage the mind or the heart? This story-telling needed a better story.

Engaging, unfortunately no.","Miss Lovely - takes you into a world you can live without going into - the sleazy world of ""horror"" films that are intended to titillate. A world of two brothers making such films - one who wants to move on to porn films and the other who wants to make a clean, romantic one. It is an uncomfortable ambiance and very intentionally so. Which is fine, only that it overtly tries to go all ""art-house"" cinema on you.Flitting between showing you the behind-the-scenes of B/C grade films and the inner angst of a crew member whose heart isn't into it, Miss Lovely's writing doesn't do justice to either the plot or its characters. Sure, I admit, I am not the biggest fan of B-C-D grade films, so the theme of the film itself isn't as appealing. On the other hand, I am always ready to travel with a character, whatever its background. But, Miss Lovely, denies me that. And that's more frustratingly than usual because it didn't have to do much to hook me in. It has the most brilliant performances and the setting is as real as it gets. It has quirks that catch you smiling wryly at the dark humor. It is commendable indeed, that with a theme such as the porn world, the movie doesn't get too graphic. Given all of that, I am ready to let go of the typical elements the film engages in - the jealous dying ""star"", the clamoring of struggling actors who can stoop to any levels to land a role in a film, and so on.What the writing fails to understand is that with a setting that is far removed from our real worlds, it becomes ever so important to engage the viewer either in the narrative or with the characters. One thing that troubles me with films is when the camera gets over-excited. I understand the hand-held jitters bring out the confusion on screen - both apparent and inner, but the impact on me is lost when its overdone. In fact, in this one the hand-held sequences are done with close-ups that ironically distance you from what's going on in the film. That's the root there, the connect - which isn't there. Certainly a downer, for a film that wants you to experience, rather than just superficially know. Yet, you cannot take away from the fact, that it is brave indeed to make a film like Miss Lovely.

It pretends to be smart in the beginning and loses interest in that too post-interval.,"Like melodrama is to drama, Mission Istanbul is to pointless style. What with super-dangerous and mega-powerful villains walking like they are on a ramp, only waiting for the hero to get to them and start a fist fight. So what if only minutes ago, they had thousands of guns and gunmen at their disposal?Initially it did feel like there was some hope from the story writer, because the plot seemed non-standard. But ultimately, it's just another power-maniac villain doing what he thinks is best to gain and maintain that power. The characters are like those in any typical action movie - the stereotypical hero, his partner and a bimbette. So, here we have these ingredients in the form of a wannabe smart-Alec, a pseudo geek and a cleavage.
Okay, I'm exaggerating a bit on the cleavage, so no need to rush to the theater yet, boys!You know there's no hope from the dialogue writer when two characters introduce themselves to each other by imitating James Bond. I can't even say it's downhill from there, because that's pretty much the bottom of the hill. It annoys me no end, when we have this really sharp villain who knows everything else but just can't spot our super-suave hero - in broad daylight! This is where the coincidences start getting to me and I almost checked whether my ticket stub said Kismat Konnection! When they show an ace journalist (Zayed Khan) as the only computer geek around, it just has to take the cake. By the way, this top-notch journalist of ours who loves danger has no clue that he can be bugged by the technically savvy villain. Fine, we can accept that the 'top-notch' bit is only the writer's imagination. But, hasn't this guy seen a single Hollywood action flick? GrrrrrSpeaking of stereotypes, another huge one is shoved down our throat, this time referring to an entire country. Is it really appropriate to show Afghanistan having an arms' market that looks like a vegetable market in any nook and corner of India? She's already a country in distress; do we need to show it worse than it is? And if it is indeed such a dangerous place what are tourists doing in the arms' market!? Aah...these markets are actually tourist attractions! Got it!! Seriously people, journalists would have some kind of protection/back-up plan when entering such a place. Also, I didn't think the cinematographer in combination with the editor did justice to either Afghanistan or Turkey. The tourist spots were covered rather hurriedly. I understand, this is no travelogue, but the beauty/ruggedness of the places was taken away from my eyes even before it registered. And I know these places have these qualities because other movies have covered them better. If only the camera focused more on recording these places as they deserve to be instead of accommodating style. Isn't it high time we stop using slow motion to imply 'style'? But, it has some 'laugh out loud' value when Zayed Khan understands the seriousness of the mission at hand. He says, ""he'll need some equipment"" and Vivek Oberoi and him pull out their sunglasses and put them on in ... slo-mo!!Interestingly enough, there was an attempt in the beginning to keep some continuity between the movie and the quintessential songs by say a one-liner like, ""Work done, let's party"" (though the work didn't look like it was done to me, but anyway...). Later they just gave up on their inhibitions and threw in a song. And yet had the gall to have a dialogue, ""There's no time for a love song!""The cinematic liberty of placing songs randomly, the 1000 coincidences that it takes to make this movie, the unreal characters all go to show how seriously they take the ""All characters in this film are fictitious, any resemblance to any person dead or alive is coincidence"" warning.

96,796,796,796,796,Mission:Impossible Ghost Protocol,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/missionimpossible-ghost-protocol-review/,,3/5.0,,3.85,"Fans who turned skeptics after M:I-3 can heave a sigh of relief. Mission:Impossible – Ghost Protocol is an engaging film that provides a jump-start to the fading franchise. Tom Cruise is back playing daredevil IMF Agent Ethan Hunt, and this time round, some much-needed originality in the action sequences make the film worth a watch. Yes, it has its moments that some people could possible find outrageously silly, but Cruise invests enough into his role to make it seem convincing. Jeremy Renner makes a fine addition to the cast. The plot keeps you hooked, the humourous undertone in the dialogue keeps things interesting and the thrills in the set-pieces make the film a good watch on the big screen.","Brian De Palma’s 1996 blockbuster, Mission: Impossible, packed in the plot. It made teenagers call their first 3.5” floppy disk a ‘NOC List’. In the new millennium, John Woo’s characteristically choreographed action set-pieces made Mission: Impossible II a cult action film. Everyone wanted to do wheelies and stoppies. In 2006, it appeared as though the franchise had run out of steam. A jaded superstar, a nowhere-near-memorable plot and action sequences that had been done to death in the previous installments made Mission: Impossible III an experience easily forgotten. Only loyalists like me would bother to watch it more than once. (Four times, at last count.)The fourth installment of the series, Brad Bird’s Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol may fall way short of being a great film, but it manages to do what appeared to be an impossible mission – it infuses some much needed life and freshness into the M:I franchise. And Thomas C. Mapother IV aka Tom Cruise, who appeared to be past his prime, is back doing what he does best.The film has a plot that isn’t too complex, but that has enough meat in it to make it interesting. Ethan Hunt and his organization, IMF, have to clear their name as they are implicated in an event that has the potential to escalate into a nuclear war. Their organization has been shut down, so their resources are limited. The electric Jeremy Renner and the beautiful Paula Patton join Tom Cruise and Simon Pegg in their mission to avert the crisis. What instantly sets this film apart from its predecessors is the droll humour that runs through it. The first installment had no place for humour, while the next two used it only to provide a hint of comic relief. Ghost Protocol, however, has a refreshing undercurrent of dry humour that makes it an easy watch. Then, of course, there are the set pieces. Originality once again triumphs, even as Tom Cruise bears the brunt of a generous dose of bumps and falls. Yes, they seem incredulous and impossible for the most part. But Tom Cruise breathes in every last ounce of his movie-star believability into them, making them genuinely thrilling. Undeniably, they demand dollops of suspension of disbelief, but that truly is a small price to pay for a few thrills. What I personally liked about the film is that for the first time, characters apart from Ethan Hunt get to have a hint of a back story. So, Jeremy Renner’s Brandt has a secret that weighs heavily on his conscience, Paula Patton’s Jane wants revenge for the loss of a loved one, and laptop-loving nerd Benji, played by Simon Pegg, gets to be a field agent, something that he never thought he could be. Jeremy Renner brings a magnetic intensity to his character. His eyes are always talking, a wonderful quality in an actor. Tom Cruise is in his element this time round, once again proving why he was once considered the biggest movie-star in the world. I love how his face and his expressions make the most preposterous sequences seem real. I also firmly believe that he is one of the most underrated ‘actors’ in film history. The rest of the cast are adequate.I’m no fan of Hollywood, but one can’t deny that even when they make films that want to ‘make you leave your brains at home’, they do suggest that you bring them along, just in case. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is one of those films that engage you, that make you enjoy it, even if it makes you go, “Come on, now that’s just ludicrous!” once in a while.Of course, an Indian review of this film would be incomplete without mentioning Anil Kapoor. He plays a sleazy Indian billionaire, and his portrayal of the character is quite reminiscent of his role in Race. But make no mistake, here is a man who has aged better than most. His role is laughable, but Anil Kapoor deserves kudos for starring in a big Hollywood film way before other potentials from Hindi cinema could. I was hoping against hope that once, just once, he would turn around and say, ‘Jhakaas!’All said and done, Hollywood finds it as easy as we do to spend big bucks on cinema that is all about form with zilch content. There will be those who will feel that M:I-4 is in that same space. However, fans of the genre and M:I loyalists will definitely feel the zing that this film has, that manages to make it worth a watch on the big screen.

Unfortunately this is only in the first half. The crisp plot withers away and the acting wanes as the climax approaches.","Watching Mithya is like watching a cricket match that started out well but ended up being one-sided after all. Anything can happen at lunch break. But in the second innings, there is no fight, no struggle to keep your attention and thus you end up with a very cold climax. And the cold-blooded murders don't have anything to do with this cold. It is more like the ""I couldn't care less"" cold. The subtle comedy in the first half is an integral part of the plot - from a comment on ""anything free is better"" attitude, to the hints at the eating habits of people in the film industry. Barring a lone toilet joke, the interdependency between the lines and the situation brings a flow to the plot. The humor along with the art direction, the background score, the performances, etc. create an environment conducive to suspension of disbelief. And disbelief you can live with. Only to see the movie being rushed from one episode to the other keeping a 120 minute time-limit in mind. Genre shifts or mixing too many genres generally bother me. But, the finger cannot be pointed towards that either. It moves from dark comedy to plain dark. That's not that much of a shift. But its disconcerting to see the humor dry up along the way. I would blame the writing for the downfall - the dialogues are not witty or funny any more, the sub-plots not that well streamlined. And it lacked the punch, the mind-bending twist that a movie of this genre needs.Giving credit where it's due though, only the likes of Rajat Kapoor could cast Ranveer Shorey as the main lead. It takes guts to have Naseeruddin Shah play second fiddle. And he certainly has made an attempt to show the many layers of VK/Raj's (Ranveer Shorey) character. Now, whether he was successful in getting them across to the audience is an altogether different issue. An awesome opportunity to portray the VK's mental process is lost.The first half-second half split in writing has taken its toll on the performances too. A promising start has everybody doing their bit and getting a cackle out of you with their comic timing. And suddenly, the acting too becomes very superficial as the movie approaches the climax.On the other hand, I thoroughly enjoyed the background score throughout the movie. At times however, especially in the beginning, it overpowered the volume of the dialogues and thus I might have missed a few good dialogues. But overall, it was refreshing accompaniment.A second half that flowed better would have made Mithya a must watch with its tongue-in-cheek humor. The anti-climatic climax leaves you feeling high and dry. All this hoopla for what? The most common way to get to a oft-repeated noir climax?

Boring songs test your patience. ,"Relationships are complex and enormously difficult. Director Swapna Waghmare Joshi probably took it to heart and determined to simplify it in a filmy way. She ends up making it puzzling and pointless. Her story appears as clueless as those relationships that have no idea of what the future holds. To make stories engrossing enough despite their repetitive nature is what a film aims for. This is where Mitwaa falters right through to the end.This so-called musical love story is quite ordinary. Shivam Sarang – a successful hotelier who hates love, marriage and commitment – falls in love with a girl afraid of relationships. Their friendship grows and so does their love for each other. But this is not it. The director brings in some tried-and-tested, formulaic twists to enthrall you. This drama, however, unfolds after exhausting you for more than an hour.Mitwaa lacks excitement, emotions, clarity and even honesty; both in its writing as well as execution. As a viewer, you are not at all part of the film’s progress. You feel sidelined. As a result, you just don’t care if the characters come together or grow apart. I found myself either laughing or yawning at emotional scenes. Non-linear storytelling is indeed one of several ways to grip audiences. Sadly, I feel it is being forcibly crammed into almost every other Marathi film these days. And Mitwaa is one of those. You correctly sense how the story will progress. However in order to contain predictability and make a usual story look unusual, the director chooses to spice up things with an astonishing end. Well, I must say it comes across asa  masterstroke. But as the scene advances, the efforts look over-explanatory. Meticulous direction is missing all over the film and this particular scene loses its impact just because of that.I wish I could speak about several narrative flaws in the film. As I go into details, it would eventually serve as spoilers to you.Every time I see Swapnil Joshi in a new film, his chocolate-boy image grows stronger. Blame it on the kind of films he does. This time, his spoilt-rich-playboy image emerges conflicting with his successful businessman’s role. I no way mean to say that a playboy can’t thrive in his professional life. The way his character is portrayed, it looks superficial. And this is the issue with all other characters too.Sonalee Kulkarni’s performance is contradictory to her background story. She is brilliant as always, yet her character falls short of emotional depth at decisive moments. If you have seen her previous work, you know what she is capable of. On the other hand, careless direction kills all the charm around Prarthana Behere’s Avni.Dialogues are tolerable. Swapnil Joshi must be credited for making some of the dullest dialogues sound outright witty. They undoubtedly lack sense.Camerawork is vivid and disappointing at the same time. Its is way too showy, and it doesn’t serve any visual treat. It overlooks the geography of characters at more than a few instances for whatsoever reasons. A hilarious moment came when a couple sitting next to me joked about it loudly, instigating the entire theatre to burst into laughter. Though this run-of-the-mill love story is set in Goa, it fails to exploit the state’s stunning locales (I don’t know if the entire film was shot in Goa).Mitwaa might do more than good business, having purposefully released on the eve of Valentine's Day. Nonetheless; the film has almost nothing that can be termed as even half good, hampering all the supposed excitement.

Mod is quite, serene, sensitive and all that's good about his films. (even though Dor is still his best)","Mod takes its time to establish the characters and settle in. Meanwhile, as an audience you are absorbing the atmosphere of this little town named Ganga, where everyone knows everyone. You follow Ayesha (Ayesha Takia) as she goes about her daily routine and unknowingly you know so much about her life from just exposure to one day in her life. That ""unknowingly"" bit is the power of good story-telling.Without realizing it, I knew and grew fond of Ayesha, a strong-headed woman, which is so important to register as the story moves on. Also, the combination of Ayesha Takia's cute, baby(?) face with the will of a girl who had to take care of herself from a very young age, make Ayesha (the character) even more likeable. Ayesha Takia portrays this girl with all her nuances - the fear, distrust, sure-headedness, uncertainties, feeling of being loved - she covers them all. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Rannvijay Singh. I wouldn't say he disappointed, casting him wasn't fair to such a strongly written character. On the other hand, maybe a few films and characters later, he'd have been ready for this one. A mentally unstable character is not an easy role to play for anyone. That the illness wasn't dramatized or glamorized was what endeared me to Mod. I'm pretty sure, some of the situations and reactions shown in the film are not medically correct, yet the entire story had an emotional angle to it which draws you to the story and its outcome. Mod is a strong, serious story told with sensitivity and conviction. Welcom back, Mr. Kukunoor. How much ever, I like experimentation, I'm glad you are done with it, or at least are on a break.

At first, I was a bit indecisive about watching it because the title sounded dated. However, the casting was superb and unprecedented--chic Neha Dhupia and scheming Ranvir Shorey, playing a couple. Their pairing reminded me of the odd but much-liked pairing of Mallika Sherawat and Rahul Bose in Pyar ke Side Effects (2006). So, I gave in.Shorey and Dhupia make a great on-screen couple. However, for the longest, I kept wondering why there wasn't any physical chemistry between the two...it could have caused the screen to sizzle. But while I wanted the sparks to fly, the screenplay almost deliberately avoided physical closeness between the two. Later in the film, all of this is in-a-way justified, which comes as a big reveal.But let me clarify, the word big is relative to the scale of surprises, the twists and turns in the film, which for the longest are quite basic. An illegal deal goes messy. The couple gets pulled into the vortex of consequences. Must find a way to get out. As time runs out, dire choices have to be made. Thrilling (albeit stale) as it may sound, the film takes its time to establish the motives and modus operandi, which is good but somewhere in its thoroughness and detailing the thrill gets compromised (even with non-linear narrative structure), until it all gets really complex and a new character, played by the talented Vidushi Mehra, comes into the picture.She finally brings out the desperation that we expected the lead pair to somehow express. The film still lacks in thrill but that void gets filled up with drama, which is a relief because it imparts the much needed 'plot thickens' feel to a relatively stoic screenplay. And from that point on the film gets better, leading you to an end that leaves you thinking about the events. And that's precisely why I am writing this review. I haven't been able to stop thinking about the film.Should we call it a success, then? I am indecisive. You could if you look at the eventual impact. But during the film's run time you could easily feel a bit disengaged. So, the net result? Watch it if you have nothing better to do.It is sad that I have to give this verdict, because in spite of the attention to detail, good cast and sincere intent, it fails in establishing a connection between the main characters and the audience. Yes, they are gray, so any empathy you feel at one point gets canceled out eventually. But that can't be a flaw, and it isn't. So, where does the film lack?The other parameters that come to mind are lackluster production design, feeble soundtrack, and camera that is unable to break the fourth wall. I am not sure if it is any one of these or all of these. But if you watch it, do tell me by commenting below.

Well, It doesn't. Save a few action pieces the film has nothing to enamor you. ","The one thing that almost everyone walking out of Mohenjo Daro is likely to disappointedly say is, “regular story fitted into history.” My additional rant is that it is not even a full-hearted attempt at saying one regular story. It knows it doesn't have enough meat to at  least look new. So, it squeezes a regular romance into a regular oppressor-common man story. And yet achieves nothing new whatsoever.It would be a real shame if the makers are convinced that they recreated history. Because there is no imagination in the sets. The costumes and makeup is pretty much what you would find in a fashion show with an Egyptian-Roman theme. Maybe the lead lady's headgear is an exception. But, that isn't too far out either. Oh yeah, the Mohenjo Daro-ites have a language of their own. Unfortunately, it makes you laugh more than admire it because of the way it moves on to regular Hindi. Oh, the after effects stay in the form of a few Hindi words modified to make you laugh some more. The references to suns and monsoons is cute to begin with but becomes annoying soon enough. As the movie progresses, it feels like the makers were so proud of this terminology that they had to use it to the fullest. The human behavior is pretty much the same too – as shallow an interpretation as many other films. Sure, a few action sequences make you sit up for a bit. But, that too has a feel of the films from the 90s. The ones that had an arena fight between the hero and a lion or an elephant or a man double the size of the hero. It brings warm memories from childhood rather than a chill down the spine.Hrithik Roshan, Pooja Hegde, Kabir Bedi are nothing but functional. I can only imagine the kind of energy some of the action sequences might have drawn from Hrithik Roshan, but the end result is nothing that stays in memory beyond the scene.  What stays though is the pounding background music that refuses to be tamed down. What stays is the despair at being fed yet another romance in the name of epic saga. What stays is the hope, that maybe next time. There is always a next time.

102,802,802,802,802,Molly Aunty Rocks!,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/molly-aunty-rocks-review/,,,,2.466666667,"A family film that would best be enjoyed as a home-viewing, Molly Aunty Rocks, directed by Ranjith Sankar, is an easy watch because of some fine performances by Revathy and Prithviraj, as well as the supporting cast. The film makes you smile, but not enough to justify a theatre watch.","Continuing the rather puzzling trend of Malayalam films bearing English titles, Ranjith Sankar’s latest film, Molly Aunty Rocks, is a simplistic, occasionally enjoyable film whose primary USP is a set of decent, smile-inducing performances.Revathy plays Molly, popularly known as Molly Aunty, an NRI who has been living in Kerala for the last two years, with her husband and children still in the US. She’s upright, law-abiding and slightly comical; a bank employee who is progressive in thought and is used to the manner in which things are done ‘by the book’ in the US. Thus, she often gets into tiffs with people who, like all of us here in India, aren’t too worried about doing things the ‘right way’. Molly Aunty Rocks maintains a feel-good, frothy sense throughout. Molly runs into a bunch of situations and handles them in a manner that is intended to make the audience smile and cheer even. However, one can’t help get the sense that everything has been too sanitized. The characters that one can identify with the most are her family members who have a problem with the way she is, because that is definitely the most likely reaction one would have to a character like Molly. However, there are a number of characters that seem to go out of the way to help her out, which does make one wonder why. One gets the feeling that in a real life situation, it would be strange for a character like her to have so many well-wishers.The biggest flaw in the film then is its screenplay. The whole set of events that happen in the first half and much of the second half were supposed to build up suspense and end in a revelation that was supposed to clear the audience’s doubts about Molly’s motivations. However, the build-up is so weak that it is only after the revelation occurs that the audience realizes that there was supposed to be a suspense element in the first place. Also, the film seems way too long for its own good. At a time when Malayalam films are clearly trying their best to compete with World cinema, the right pace for a film is absolutely critical for it to truly hold the audience.As mentioned earlier, the strength of the film lies in the performances. All said and done, Revathy is pitch-perfect. She is one of the finest actresses India has, and her performance here proves it. Prithviraj makes a late entry into the film, but he is excellent. A fine, young actor, he makes the role his own. The supporting cast of the film does a good job.If only the characters had been fleshed out more, with a lot more attention paid to the little details, along with a sharper screenplay, this film could really have been a good, slice-of-life story of the struggles that one has to go through when up against ‘the system’ in India. However, as it stands, Molly Aunty Rocks isn’t a complete waste of the audience’s time, because there is some amount of fun to be had in the situations and the performances. But it isn’t a must-see by any standard.

Yet, it is watchable. That's something, right? Mostly for its performances.","The philosophy that revenge is making an aware choice between evil and worse evil is not new. It almost sanctions evil as the right thing to do. There are no surprises there. Yet, Mom as a revenge movie is engaging. To make an engaging movie out of a not-so-engaging story is quite a mean feat.In fact, Mom is so predictable that if you put the trailer and the theme together you can predict the climax a good half an hour before it begins, if not even earlier. “How” it happens has a twist and the challenges that come in the way are unexpected, but that is not what keeps you hooked. Also, the pace is not swift so you are not really at the edge of your seat. The moments stall more to let you soak the emotion in, rather than to create suspense.This emotion I think is what keeps you from getting bored. The parents' sorrow and frustration is apparent yet not once goes over-the-top. Maybe because every time my teenage daughter steps out of the house alone, the tiny nag at the back of my mind doesn't relent, till she's back – it is easier for me to get involved in the film. Maybe because though I can't put myself for a moment in Devki's (Sri Devi) place, I find my comfort in only sympathising with her – I feel like I would have engaged even more had the topic not been so close to reality.That is the power of the performances. Adnan Siddiqui, Akshaye Khanna, Abhimanyu Singh all play their part without getting in the way of the story. Interestingly on Nawazuddin Siddqui as DK seemed a little out of place because the character is quirky – slightly away from the tone of the film.  Both Sridevi and Sajal Ali bawl their eyes out without a decibel seeming out of place. Even as I child I had to work hard on ignoring Sridevi's accent. It didn't help that the roles she played in those times required her to overact. Here, she is in control and the script supports her restraint.While the overall plot is as run-of-the-mill as the next revenge thriller, some subtleties are done really well. For instance, the role reversal in genders before and after are such subtle examples of sexism. Not the kind that we can blame movies for. The kind we appreciate in movies because that's how a day in the life of a typical woman is in real life.I don't know if Mom could have been a better film if the writing were tighter. Its pauses had a reason that might not be in line with that of a thriller. I don't know if Mom could have been a better film if the writing at least tried to be unpredictable. What I know is I will look forward to director, Ravi Udyawar's next work. I wouldn't mind watching more films written by him, Girish Kohli or Kona Venkat Rao. I certainly want to watch the next Sridevi film, something that I couldn't imagine saying 25-30 years ago. That is good enough.

And to bring about that you have an ensemble of interesting characters. A rich, spoilt brat but he has business acumen, a fashion designer who cares for the common man, an honest advertising creative head, a fashion model, a popular TV actoress, and a loser who has an unbeatable positive attitude. And the attempt is by keeping the vein light. Unfortunately, ultimately nothing comes of the synergy they could create as a team or to them as individual characters.You're right, this is too serious an analysis for a movie in this genre and with this look and feel. But, every time I see a good idea blow up in execution, it hurts...And think about it? A comedy that squeezes out the sense of humor in you (believe me, I do have one!) Of course, the common man here refers to a person with no means to wear labeled brands, and has no sense of fashion. However, if the basic idea were thought through properly, it could have been extrapolated to so many situations where the common man suffers an unnecessary inferiority complex. This complex could be treated with something as simple as a product created just for him and by just being honest with him. Alas, if wishes were horses...If the elaboration of the story is amateurish, the other departments from screenplay, to dialogues, to their delivery, to the expressions on the actors' faces, to the ambience created around the actors, to the background music are equally amateurish.  It's really a shame that when half an hour is spent in establishing the 6 main characters and 2-3 side characters, in the end it all seems futile. For example, Aftab Shivdasani's character who's creative at coming out with advertising taglines, does nothing spectacular in the end! None of the actors are given anything out of their comfort zone and thus nothing seems more than below average. As we have it, Govinda fans could very well be disappointed too. I guess we should be grateful to Ganesh Acharya for deciding on limiting usage of Om Puri as a voice over. Otherwise, we know what he can be made to do in slapsticks such as these. But, that doesn't relieve us from Prem Chopra's antics. One can't get everything one wishes for. Yet, there can be no excuse for keeping him on screen for long spans of time with just one expression on his face. And this happened more than once, where nothing was happening on screen, even the camera wasn't moving! So yeah, some trimming was obviously called for. There are digs on various characters and issues you would encounter in your day-to-day life - Label designers and their attitude. Family soap operas, the camerawork and sound effects they use and of course, their viewers. Industrialists, the rich and their problems which have seemingly simple solutions. Telemarketers and how they annoy us. Popularity can make the commonest person a TV show host.I thought the non-jumpy movements given to the actors in the songs were nice, if only for being different. But, the placement of the not-so-good-sounding music is so abrupt that the 'nice' feeling comes too late in the song to register.As Manoj Bajpai, the guy with the ultimate positive attitude, says when he loses 80 lakhs in a business deal, ""I gained 1 crore worth of experience, I'm still in the green with 20 lakhs!"", anyone who sees the movie can say, ""they gained 1 crore worth of experience of not watching a movie that looks slapsticky and has a cheesy title!""

105,805,805,805,805,Moneyball,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/moneyball-review/,,,,4.35,"While Brad Pitt is definitely the most appealing thing about Moneyball, it is watchable for many more reasons, primarily the writing by stalwarts Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin, and the unhurried, loving manner in which director Bennett Miller has treated the film. A sports film that focuses more on what goes on behind the scenes, Moneyball, based on a true life story, talks about how, in sport, there is so much more than what meets the eye. It is engaging, layered and emotional.  ","There are sports films and there are sports films. And there is Moneyball. There are sports films that show you the sport. They make you feel the adrenaline, they make you want to get up and cheer. And at the climax, when who you are rooting for wins, they give you that shiver up your spine, because victory is an emotion like no other. And then… there is Moneyball. Nearly seven years after his first feature, the beautifully acted Capote, Bennett Miller returns, this time teaming up with star screenwriters Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin, to deliver a sports film, a baseball film to be precise, that is more about the underlying passion for the game than the adrenaline that goes with playing or consuming it. At the same time, it is also more about using logic to get things right in sport, instead of relying on ‘perceptions’ of skill and talent. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), a former prodigal but failed baseball player himself, is now General Manager of the Oakland Athletics – a team that has been on the fringes, primarily because of their incredibly low budget compared to giants like the Boston Red Sox or the New York Mets. As a result, they are also faced with the problem of attrition – their star players invariably go along with fat pay packets to play for the big guns. A chance meeting with a Yale Economics graduate Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) convinces Beane that there is a way to put together a winning team even on a low budget. Chak De! India meets Jerry Maguire meets The Social Network, who then meet Zaillian and Sorkin, both masters of the screenplay. Moneyball takes you off the field and into the rooms where the decisions are taken. It is layered and purposeful, because that is how mental games are. Though quite long, Moneyball is still exceptionally written, with full credit to Miller for not hurrying with proceedings. Brad Pitt’s character is still haunted by the ghosts of the days gone by and those long, silent scenes of him contemplating his past, present and future, his love for the game, his belief in his tactics may bore some, but if you pause the way his character has, you might just see why they are necessary. Along with the obvious developments in the team-building aspects of the film, a number of other, at times more pertinent issues are touched upon. How difficult is it to let a player ‘go’? How difficult is it to be the man at the helm, the man at whom the buck stops? What do you do when you have so much at stake, but you also have in you a sense of being a jinx? And what do you really have at stake when you are a middle-aged divorcee with a daughter who hero-worships you? How much can you really put on the line? Moneyball is immersive because it is a film that transcends the obvious traps that a film on sport can fall prey to.Brad Pitt combines his natural, cocky movie-stardom with intensity, purpose and a firm sense of being, to deliver a standout (and incidentally, Academy Award-nominated) performance. Jonah Hill, better known from earlier comic roles, is cast in a dramatic role for the first time, and he does it justice – he has also been nominated for an Academy Award. He is genuinely adorable, and he holds his own in front of Pitt, a feat in itself.Moneyball is a film that Hollywood normally finds hard to make. “A sports film without slow motion? VFX heavy on-field action shots? Bah!” In spite of that, it is a film that would only be completely comprehendible with at least some knowledge of baseball. There is no attempt to ‘explain’ baseball to those who have no knowledge of it, and baseball jargon is part of the day-to-day language for the characters in the film. It is also the kind of film that will grow better with subsequent viewings, because the viewer can gently unpeel the layers in the writing and the performances. For the first viewing though, some prior reading on baseball will help immensely.

You can see the sincere effort in trying to keep us interested in the events. Unfortunately, the effort is not successful because of this irrepressible urge to be stylish and muck around with the timeline in the narrative. ","Playing around with the timeline is cool and must be fun too when you are making a film. It stands out as different and keeps the audience alert. But NOT when the price you pay is holes in the main plot. When that happens non-linear narration take away a lot from the film, instead of adding value. And that is exactly what happens in Monica. In his effort to keep us thinking, director, Sushen Bhatnagar forgets to give us some key events in the story. The ones that could have gotten us more interested in the characters and feel for them. The only emotion I feel for Monica Jaitley, is ""maybe, she deserved it."" Which would be fine if I thought Sushen Bhatnagar wanted us to feel that way. But, the way her case is put forth by her parents' lawyer, it looks like Sushen wanted sympathy from us. I felt a little sorry for the small-town girl, Monica who is under her husband's shadow; maybe she has talent, but she doesn't quite believe she is good for anything. I would have been proud of the confident, enigmatic person she changes into, if I knew what brought about the change. If I am not a part of that transformation, it just comes across as a mere convenient jump for the storywriter. The film also refuses to answer other important questions. What is the big deal about becoming a ""special correspondent""? Can one ""special correspondent"" really cause any sort-of damage to a powerful politician - a politician who doesn't need to say who he wants out of his way, people around him just know? Why and how did the mass population get interested in justice for Monica? And these are only unanswered questions. There is a whole different list of logical loopholes. A sample - Why is the judge humoring a lawyer who is going on and on with irrelevant conjectures? I got tired of him, didn't the judge? Sure he keeps saying it is relevant, but not once, are you told how. Fortunately, though it is not all bad. I liked the bits where Monica is confronting her fears. Divya Dutta gives an extremely strong performance. I'm sure the actor had to completely drain herself out for some of the scenes. If for nothing else, I'd watch this film because it gives an actor who has always played side roles, a chance at carrying the film. And she does, to whatever extent the writing allows her. Beyond that it is the writer's failure. The writer also should've given the other characters a chance too. They are  all pretty one-dimensional and don't get you involved one bit. Two characters who really deserved more and had actors to carry them off too - Monica's loser husband, Raj (Rajit Kapoor) and the menace-cum-gentleman politician (Ashutosh Rana). Raj gets marred by some theatrical acting (not that the actor can't do anything else) and the politician is left half-baked.It's sad that a project that has interesting characters, a compelling story couldn't become a watch-worthy film. The culprits being - the details in the writing and a failed attempt at stylized execution.

107,807,807,807,807,Monsoon Shootout,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review17 Critic Reviews 2.4/5.0,/movie/monsoon-shootout-review/,2.4/5.0,,,2.933333333,"Alternate lives based on the choices you make, consequences of your actions, helplessness of the conscientious – the film takes on these philosophies in an absorbing, crisp-ish tale of right, wrong, and ... ?","Monsoon Shootout gets so many things right by just keeping things simple and straightforward. Else, a story that involves change in consequences depending on the choice a character makes could get too confusing, too quick. Also, it gives the writer room to explore the crux of the story – the dilemma. You are engaged through most of it because it is like watching 3 short films, with characters who you have grown familiar with.This build-up of characters across the choices intrigued me the most. The story around the last choice wouldn’t have had an impact, if we didn’t know what we knew about the characters. Also, by this last round, you also are familiar with the tone of the film. You know whatever the protagonist does, his life is a bit of a mess.  And you still wish he comes out at least half successful. This is the hook. Your emotion entangled with the good guy for nothing but his goodness. You almost don’t want him to have to struggle with right, wrong and the paths in between. While dealing with these larger philosophical questions, Monsoon Shootout also points fingers at each wheel, in the gear system, that makes being dutiful and principled so difficult – the business-politician-administration nexus, the objectification and exploitation of women, the wrong ways of doing the right thing, having to accept that the end justifies the means, and despite it all, the expected morality from a common person. The wonderfully woven script brings out the protagonist’s vulnerability as simply as if it were a flow chart. Sure, it gets a tad repetitive and slightly long-drawn towards the end. But arguably, the choices ended at the peak. The writing is also elegant in that the characters don’t drastically change even though their choice-dependent world has changed. It must certainly have been tempting to draw contrasts by making the unknowns diametrically opposite in nature. This is one of those rare films that has such a firm grip on the writing that it makes the work of the actors look easy. The three protagonists played by Vijay Verma, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, and Neeraj Kabi might be varied in terms of experience but have been bankable since their first films. Unfortunately, the supporting characters came across as caricatures. And yet, it is acceptable enough to not take away from the various points the film wants to make. Monsoon Shootout is certainly one of those I’d like to watch again to observe the nuances I might have failed to notice. Yes, the first viewing certainly promises that there are details you could have missed out.

108,808,808,808,808,[The] Monuments Men,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/10-monuments-men-review/,,,,2.933333333,"George Clooney's fifth directorial effort, The Monuments Men, is a film that promises much more than it eventually delivers. The WWII setting and ensemble cast can't save the film from being the disappointment that it is.","The most audacious stories are often found in real life; and when these stories are adapted for the screen in the right manner, they usually have what it takes to enthral viewers. Ben Affleck's Argo, for instance, was the perfect example of how a real life tale can be adapted to make a thrilling film.A cursory glance at George Clooney's latest, The Monuments Men, can make one feel that the film has precisely what it takes to deliver what Argo did - a hooking World War 2 based premise and a cast that has the chops to pull it off in style. Think about it - an unlikely bunch of non-soldiers are brought together and sent in to World War II Europe to retrieve valuable pieces of art that were stolen by Hitler's regime, on his orders. Picassos and Rembrandts and Michelangelos; artworks that are like the markers of humankind's cultural progress; art that, if lost, would be like a loss of a fragment of humankind itself.Yet, at least in cinema, there is but a thin line between subtlety and exaggeration; and in choosing the former, Clooney ends up making a staid film that is underwhelming at best.Of course, it was rather brave of Clooney to choose the understated manner in which he chose to narrate a story that had enough in it to become a thrill-a-minute heist film. Hollywood studios aren't particularly known to favour the kind of narrative style he has chosen. The film has its heart in the right place, but ends up becoming a victim of its own manner. The question, really, is how subtle is 'too subtle'.The film doesn't particularly have a graph; you expect it to rise and rise as it progresses, but it never does. You expect it to lead you to an exciting finale, only to leave you disappointed. Laced with a few genuine smile-worthy moments and with a large amount of respect for the masters of art, the film focuses more on instilling an awareness about just how important our art is, in the overall story of humanity.Despite taking us through familiar people and places - at least from history textbooks, if nothing else, the film fails to truly engage and connect. In fact, the film is set in the fag end of WWII, when Germany had begin to withdraw a lot of their European occupation. The stellar cast - Clooney himself, Matt Damon, Jean Dujardin, John Goodman, Bob Balaban, Bill Murray and Cate Blanchett, amongst others, do a great job - precisely what was expected of them. However, the film jumps between their stories too often, which concurrently means that no particular character stays with you once the film is over.As director, Clooney is certainly maturing with time. He easily seems more in control than he did in The Ides of March, for instance. As I mentioned earlier, the route he chose to narrate this particular story is a brave one; a world away from the one chosen by Affleck in Argo. One wonders though, whether it is that which proves to be the film's biggest undoing. Including the audience and evoking a response only in rare spurts, The Monuments Men is mostly just bland.

109,809,809,809,809,Moods of Crime,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review3 Critic Reviews 0/5.0,/movie/moods-crime-review/,0/5.0,,,3.2,Moods of Crime will make you uncomfortable with its audacity. The story would've had an even better grip if the film were finer in other aspects.,"Moods of Crime is a bold film. Not because of its explicit sexual content and language thereof. But because it pushes the envelop for the genre, especially in Hindi films. It is worth a watch for being a genuine psychological thriller. Unfortunately, there are other aspects that hold the film back. The film doesn't have the usual trappings of a thriller – for example, no loud background music to guide you to the edge of your seat. Eerie silence in the background with plain dialogue does the trick. Of course, this could've been more out of necessity than choice owing to budget constraints. But, silence always spooked me more than violins and percussion as cue. Of course, you cannot grant a movie points for what it hasn't done or what it was supposed to do anyway.  The plot with two criminal psychology students getting into the shoes of a criminal quite literally is intriguing by itself.  The details of how they go about it - their intellectual progress from one crime to another, their moral and ethical deterioration from one crime to the next, and how each one of them handles both – makes the film worth a watch. A non-linear story becomes an engaging thriller when it gets its timing right. The point in the story at which the film starts, the rhythm of the back and forth, the peak when the big reveal comes all contribute to whether or not the story works. Though Moods of Crime gets all of this right, it has a story that would have worked even without the gimmickry of disjointed narration. There are other things too, that are just about bearable about the film. I would have said one of the major problem areas is the performances by one and all. But, at a closer look, the acting is not affected, it is the dubbing that completely gives way. So, it's not that Ayaz Ahmed and Anima Pagare (the students) are expressionless. In fact, they convey their angst and confidence, their childlike enthusiasm and frustration. However, the moment they say a dialogue, you are distracted and annoyed. Anima becomes shrill and Ayaz seems disoriented. As the end credits roll, you realise their voices were dubbed by others. Also, the teacher, Uppekha Jain (the teacher) doesn't seem to know what to do with her accent – should she hide it or flaunt it? Fortunately, some of the dialogue is straightforward and works well. But at other times, it comes across as an attempt to seem authentic with jargon from psychology. In fact, for a long time into the film it feels like it wants to be a lesson in criminal psychology. When you realise later that it wanted to be a psychological thriller, plain and simple. Despite being bogged down by important elements that make a film, Moods of Crime holds through because of its writing. It manages to make you uncomfortable not only by its unabashed language but also because of the thought process of its protagonist(s) and the shudder down the spine they bring. ~ ~ ~Disclaimer: The film's director is a friend's brother.

So modern that it is a difficult to digest. The gray characters are interesting but lose charm because of the archaic narrative style. ,"The first few sequences of the film are pretty dreadful. I was actually worried that a downplayed Baghban was in store for me. Older generation = all good. Younger generation = all bad. Soon enough that morphed into something completely different and yet it was predictable. How they managed that is something you have to see yourself. The problem is none of this was done interestingly.Dialogues were the most clichéd and thus not even yawn-worthy. The situations are given ample time to establish the equation between various characters. But, again none of them with a great impact. Individually the characters though had very interesting nuances. The villainous ones had a shade of good that went naturally with their personality and vice versa. The prospect of watching Anupam Kher, especially when it's likely to be serious, is very exciting for me. But there's nothing special about his act here. Its neither a performance worth an applause nor would it receive negative feedback. Sharmila Tagore is her charming self. Divya Dutta took full advantage of the extra space afforded to her here and played the bitch to perfection. But ultimately over-dramatizes towards the end. Rajit Kapoor didn't have anyting exciting to convey the characters intentions were clear. The rest of the cast needs some serious acting lessons. A huge irritant was a song playing at random moments, sometimes back-to-back. The music was an ear-sore, they were picturized in the most awful fashion. The lyrics - at least the ones I could hear without awful music distracting me - were decent. The music and lyrics were two distinct entities. Usually in a 'different' concept, the climax is what makes or breaks the film. Here the cliffhanger at the interval just trashed the movie for me. It was so predictable and mundane that the audience was cursing itself for being in the theater. The bold climax didn't redeem the film. Despite characters behaving exactly as they were built so far. And that's a shame. Because it is in fact a huge step to defy prevalent social norms. And thus, yet another promising story-line becomes a martyr at the hands of an ambitious director. The one who wants to film a story that is close to his heart but finds himself obligated to stick to commercial norms of song-dance-drama routines.

111,811,811,811,811,[The] Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/mortal-instruments-city-bones-review/,,,,3.1,"Yet another teenage romance disguised with a fantasy adventure setting, The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is, at best, a tiring ordeal to sit through. Generous on clichés and borrowed settings and tropes, the only real redeeming quality of the film is that it ends.","The biggest fallout of something terribly mediocre doing well is that it spawns a whole generation of mediocrity based on the same theme, with the aim of cashing in on the mania. The Twilight franchise, then, is the torchbearer for teen romances dolled up with monsters and/or fantastical adventure settings. So Twilight led to another franchise Hunger Games (which, I must admit, was guilty fun) of which the second film is on its way, and the recent other Stephenie Meyer adaptation, The Host. The latest to follow this trend is The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones – the first film adaptation from a set of books by Cassandra Clare. So exhaustingly inane and utterly ridiculous is the film that when I walked out, I couldn’t believe I had only been in there for only a little over two hours. Now, I’m scared of just how many books are left in the series. This first film hasn’t even had time enough to gather all of its brickbats, but the sequel is already underway.Clary is a typical teenager with typical teenage problems – or so she thinks. Clary and her geeky best friend Simon get drawn into a world of werewolves and vampires and magical portals; a world where even Bach was supposedly a Shadowhunter and wrote music that could tell a demon apart by its reaction to it – no, I’m not making this up. Packed with so much exposition, explanation, back-story and mythology, but with clichés that rival all of this in equal measure - the film is such a cumbersome watch. It just never eases up on the levels of idiocy it so inevitably keeps crossing. I haven’t read the source material, so I don’t know; but it seems like a lot of this has more to do with the direction than with the original novel. Harald Zwart, director of Agent Cody Banks and Jaden Smith’s The Karate Kid, directs this film with what seems like alarming intent to ensure that it never separates itself from the other typical teen movies I mentioned earlier. This is the kind of film where it begins raining indoors in the middle of a kiss. It is, of course, conveniently attributed to something else later, but the point was clearly the kiss in the rain. The film also keeps giving you a Harry Potter-Constantine déjà vu, which isn’t necessarily a good thing. Apart from never being able to shake off the been-there-seen-that feel, the film just doesn’t seem to have an original word in its screenplay. The film does have some interestingly executed VFX pieces, but that’s just the opposite of me nitpicking – I was left determinedly hunting for anything at all to take away from the film. With its generous display of hooded or skeleton-shaped gargoyles and statues and a camera that continuously seems to want to establish setting with every new scene, the film tries hard to create a sense of foreboding and danger - which I admit does happen once in a while. However, anything good achieved comes undone with the next familiar fantasy-teen-romance-trope or next annoying back-story-exposition that the film takes you through.It doesn’t help that the performances in the film are as mundane as can be. Even the known faces, Lena Headey and Jonathan Rhys Meyers amongst others, are left with roles that often make you wonder how they kept a straight face through it. The young trio who are left with the task of carrying the film give it their all, but there’s only so much one can do when everything else around is how it is in this film. The film is just so draining and wearisome, that every time you spot the Mortal Cup that everyone’s running after, you wish you had some strong wine to go with; downing a cup would make this film infinitely more tolerable.

There are some movies after which you draw a blank because they’ve left you spellbound. You don't know how to express the exhilaration you feel. Isn't it strange that you draw the same blank for movies that leave you numb. You are left listless after watching the random crap and have no clue what to do next. Just in case you haven't guessed it yet, Mr. Whilte Mr. Black does the latter.So, here I am, absolutely listless and numb in the head, don't know where to begin. I tried the usual - mention major positives first...genuine blank...true, there are a few things in the beginning that were ""not bad"". Like in the opening action sequence, the stunts and special effects are slick. But, the badly painted yellow car and the shoddy overuse of the blue tinge are extremely distracting. Then, I like the way we are introduced to the characters - no voiceover, no title cards, just plain episodes. What the characters are going through, defines them for us. But, the characters are so not interesting. I thought the days of having characters forced into the story with the sole function of playing comic relief were long gone. I guess I'm mistaken.The three women who are stylishly kicking men around in the opening sequence have no character sketch at all. They are just clones of each other. They have no dialogues, they enter-exit-reenter-reexit randomly. They haven't even bothered giving these women names. When the writer himself is hell bent upon belittling his characters, what story/character arc are we going to find? And exactly how often are we supposed to leave our proverbial brain behind?Now, when those are the positives, am I to be blamed, if I just feel like writing a one-word review, ""BAD""? What more can I be expected to say when Arshad Warsi, of all the people is so loud that you feel like having the usher mute the volume? For me, Suniel Shetty never worked as a simpleton. Somehow, his image and demeanor don't have anything village-like about them. So, if my problems start with casting itself, the list of things to complain about is just too long. Don't I need to be convinced there is a determining factor behind casting those particular six women, other than that they were ready to bare all?The music is as kitschy-90-ish as could be, and the lyrics are extremely generic. In fact, I think one of the songs almost worked as a lullaby for me. And I don't know where to look, if the idea of entertainment is taking a crane top-down shot of a swimming-trunk-clad Arshad Warsi lying down and doing the weirdest hand and leg movements (supposedly seductive(?))? And this surrounded by 50+ women wearing bikinis who are doing similar movements. And yeah, all of them are on striped beach towels. Very disturbing visually, believe me. So, yeah, I think I've said enough where one word would have sufficed. In the interest of brevity and saving both your time and mine, I would just say, get your ""to watch"" list out and watch a few of the movies on that list this weekend.

After what we can call a typical start to a Bhatt-thriller, comes the typical death and inevitable resurrection/revival. The mumbo-jumbo is different, but outcome typical. What is atypical though is the resolution. It makes you sit up and notice, if you have been paying attention thus far, that is. It doesn't help that the actors all seem to be going through the motions rather than emotions. It must be said though that the lead lady's character gets a bit more to do here than your typical film in this genre. The story winds and unwinds way too much in the second half. It is almost as if the intriguing climax was the goal. The events leading up to it had to be convincing given the maze of characters and their motivations. So, whatever it took to get to that end given the constraints was done. On the way you have some decent use of CGI, though I'd have liked to see it in 2D. The prosthetics are pretty awful, the kind that makes you laugh rather than gross you out. At the end, I was a little surprised and a little disappointed. Given the dilemma and the conclusion thereof, the concept deserved better screenplay and writing. Should I be happy then that there seems to be a series on the way? ;)

Still doesn't make it any more enjoyable. Madcap story but no laughs.  Thankfully not too slapsticky, but all the drama is a downer.","Mubarakan is a little more coherent then other Anees Bazmee films. Now, whether I felt that way because I was determined to not let my brain come in the way of all-precious enjoyment or whether it was intentional on the makers part, we will never know. But, I am willing to let go of credit to my effort. Even so, “more coherent than other Anees Bazmee films” doesn't really mean much, does it?Mistaken identities, misunderstandings multiplied by characters who insist on looking at the obvious – Mubarakan is full of them. But, I just didn't find any of it funny. In fact, huge chunks of the film were more dramatic than humorous. For most of the film, characters are worried about a lie being found out. Only to cover it up with another lie. The only thing that was meant to be funny was Kartar Singh's (Anil Kapoor) attempt at using metaphors.One of the most difficult things to consume about these films is that they are all about a wedding or someone getting married. There is hardly anything outside of this realm in Mubarakan. Then it is difficult not to fume over things like the expected subservience of the ladies involved. This one went a step backward in having the girl's father foot the wedding bill. It has been a while since I've seen this one in this genre of films. I was wondering if we had progressed that bit, where at least they don't talk about it in pop culture. Unfortunately, it came across more matter-of-factly than satire.The performances were in line with whatever is expected from this genre of Hindi films – loud and over-the-top. I was pleasantly surprised that Ratna Pathak Shah could have some grace because her character wasn't completely caricatured. Same goes for the actor who plays Pawan Malhotra's wife. So, except for the slight improvement in story, the genre goes on with the rest. Thankfully, It doesn't have the slapstick that we have come to expect. The song and dance aren't that upbeat. I am not sure then why even someone who likes the genre would watch this one. Me? My worries take me into the future. Today, I saw two films that are lesser known chapters in Indian history – one from 40+ years ago and the other from 70+ years ago. Irrespective of the quality of the films and their accuracy, compared to those times and the sacrificers the generations before us made to just survive, we live in superbly liberated times. I wonder what a film 30-40 years later about today's times would look like. Would it feel like they are living in better times than now? I surely hope they don't think our live were like the third film I saw today. shudder

But according to him, he is a dreamer who wants to make it big in the world by doing something that would require his complete soul to be involved & not just a 9-5 of his time.From the many characters and the other unlikely ones (especially Anand’s grandfather scientist), one could sense a pattern of sorts emerge from the way they behave. It is as though when Myshkin wanted to make a super-hero flick, his dystopian characters (the ones that we associate him with in his earlier ventures) decided to wear a mask and fill in for the requisite roles of a super-hero flick. This could well be the real purpose of naming the movie as Mugamoodi, the mask that Myshkin’s world wears to enter the super-hero world; the point  being so extensively explained in the song 'vaayamoodi summa iruda'. As Anand's friends start to sing the song which would advise about his dazed state of mind after love at first sight, Myshkin just lets his hero jump into Swiss alps, ripping away from his roots and make it into a mere romantic number. Unfortunately, though he stands in a picturisque location, his heart still thinks and talks in a way only people in his world do. For a super-hero movie to stay in our mind, it needs that extra special writing, which Myshkin somehow managed in the first half by borrowing elements from his Hollywood counterparts. Albeit being able to accustom to the 'what if Myshkin's brand of characters were set in a super-hero plot', as the movie moved-on from the build-up phase and stepped into serious 'super-hero' action, I couldn’t stand the travesty. From being an inspired effort, the film became a spoof of the American heroes; especially at the fag-end of the tale where we are confused whether to laugh or shout with anger over the happenings on the screen. Looking back, the warning which Anand’s friends gave him during the 'vaayamoodi summa iruda' song, could actually be for Myshkin, who intentionally deviated from his roots, then on, into a field he couldn’t penetrate.

It's easy-going, well-edited and breezy-paced. The dialogue is witty and snappy, much like the characters. Campus romances have always occupied a soft corner in my heart. Like many of us, a huge portion of school and college revolved around ""who likes who?"" and what they are going to do about it. It took me back to those days, so, I 'like'.","Have you ever noticed, that being around people younger than you, brings a spring in your step, makes you take life a little less seriously and deservedly so. Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge makes you spend two hours with regular yet vibrant twenty-one year-olds. And I don't know about that spring in the step, but it surely leaves a warm, mushy feeling. And despite all the predictability, the sharp dialogue and interesting characterization are good enough to make it worth the trip to the theaters. There is only so much new that you can have in a girl-meets-boy story - somebody has to fall in love with somebody or someone has to live without someone . There is only that much more new you can expect from comic situations - there will be mistaken identities, there will be puns, there will be an attempt to infuse everyday, colloquial humor in the said situations and puns. Even if you come up with more such situations, hardly anything is going to be novel. The devil then lies in the details. And Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge does a wonderful job of getting the mini-situations in the situations, right. The lines are clever, they are delivered smartly and with control. Some of the back and forth between characters is so quick, that you miss what is told. Not the annoying hurried, quick. The kind of pacy dialogue that makes you sure, that you missed something good, given the tone of the film. Full credit to the almost brand new cast. From the main foursome, to the character roles - they are all played out well. I completely enjoyed Saqib Saleem and Saba Azad's performances. They annoy and entertain appropriately. Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge sticks to the genre it picks. It is not setting out to say anything profusely profound, but in its little way, it leaves around little quotable quotes and witticisms. Though the film never says it out loud, the overall impact is that - love is beyond a ""hot"" body and online personas. The next logical step is a story about how outdoor sports scores over the online ""dhishoom-dhoosh!""Of course, there is the underlying assumption that most urban romances are online rather than offline. We can argue about whether this is true or not, but the point is having made that assumption, the writers have a story to tell. They tell it well, and the director ably guides the youthful spirit of the story. In this particular case, the well-paced narration and the slick editing has a lot to add to the fresh feel of the film. The songs needed to have a little more zing. Except for the ""dhyaun dhyaun"" song, they are all pretty lame. But, they are again, elevated by the way they are edited. So brisk is the movement that you don't feel like you are listening to something average. Yes, I gladly take back all the nasty things I had to say after seeing the promo of the film. A decent film is so worth having to eat my words. Do I have a choice, considering a predictable boy-meets-girl story, with an unexplained transformation in character, created a string of moments that brought a tear to me eye?

After that though, the film loses steam slightly because it gets a touch repetitive. ","Casteism, feminism, bureaucracy, state of sports – Mukkabaaz takes on all these causes in its stride. It puts them with the story of a boxer who faced roadblocks from all directions – enough to get you riled up and thinking about all the wrongs in our society today. Yet, it let’s go of all the energy in the last hour by making the film a tad repetitive. It is intense enough that you want a break from the aggressiveness of it all. However, the touch of humor and drama can be blamed for making that last hour feel like a bit of a stretch. Sure, some of the one-liners and situations make you laugh out loud and clap. And except for a couple of sequences where the background score pounds on till you realise that it is a dramatic moment, it adds value and pulses very well with the situations. But all of this takes your attention away from the story and disengages you a bit. So it is a balancing act between enjoying those sarcy but fun moments where the writers take a jab at Hindi films or a social situation and the intense familial or boxing stories. Individually, neither of these are striking enough to make you expect the unexpected. But collectively, you are constantly waiting for the worst to happen.The edge is sharper because every time you think the situation is exaggerated you remember this is inspired from a true life story. And if newspaper headlines are to go by, reality must be so much more worse. This after all was a much stronger couple facing the tyrannical uncle or the toxic boss. And they had support from other family members and coaches. What must meeker personalities with little or no support go through?While you don’t completely feel the pain because of the treatment, this empathy gets full backing from the performances. You hate the Bareilly coach, Bhagwan more because of Jimmy Shergill’s oft-repeated yet menacing body language. You take to Shravan’s grit and Sunaina’s firm boldness because of Vineet Kumar Singh and Zoya Hussain. You cheer Shravan when he intimidates an oppressor because of the actor’s perfect depiction of a small-time bureaucrat. You can’t think of this bureaucrat without thinking of the caste conflict brought out between Shravan’s boss and him is subtle yet powerful especially when compared to the blatant casteism that Bhagwan flaunts. Similarly, feminism takes a subtle flavour through Shravan and Sunaina’s relationship.These are things you have come to expect in Anurag Kashyap films. And yet, Mukkabaaz is different because it feels like the director is finally out of the zone where he wants to make a point. This story is being told because the story ought to be told and not because he wants to tell the story. This could also be why Mukkabaaz feels a little underwhelming. It has some great lines but it doesn’t have solid punch-lines. It has great writing but the writing doesn’t wear it’s political, social opinion on its sleeves. It has decent execution but the focus is on the narrative rather than style. Not that punch-lines, strong opinions or style was ever unenjoyable in Kashyap films, it’s just that here they are conspicuous by their absence – in a good way. It is nice to see a departure from the usual, even if it doesn’t completely work.

Mukti Bhawan seems slow yet engages.","A film about death is unlikely to have a sparkle. A film's ordinary protagonists are expected to do something heroic. Yet, they ought to do so while staying in the realm of reality. Mukti Bhawan doesn't glitter but is like a jewel that has been lying open in the attic - jaded but sneaks a gleam through one spot that escaped the dust. But even if you could take pride in owning it, it is not practical for you to wear it often. Mukti Bhawan is that slow-paced, “nothing really happens” film you can watch once in a while. But that once, it will make you smile even as it is with a tinge of dark humor. Living through your ordinary life, dealing with the regular ups and downs, doing what is expected of you – who said that is not heroic?If there is one time when it is acceptable to disobey your parent, it is when they asks you to drop them off to a city that is considered the city of salvation - a city that welcomes people who think their end is near. Rajiv (Adil Hussain) is faced with the same dilemma. It is not that his father (Lalit Behl) has been the best parent around, it is not that he doesn't frustrate Rajiv with his petty bickering or demands. But you can't just leave your parent to die. This identification with Rajiv alone is enough to keep you with the character. He does his duty like any other child. Maybe he takes a step less or more. It is not a very deeply defined character, but this one aspect about him is all that is required for the film. Dayanand Kumar, his father is the drifting ol' man you'd expect a 76-77 year old to be. That along with the milieu of Benares kept me immersed. Adil Hussain and Lalit Behl share that love-hate chemistry that any other parent-child would share, thus making them absolutely believable. It is not only this familial relationship that Mukti Bhawan touches upon. The relationship Dayanand has with young granddaughter, Sunita (Palomi Ghosh) is an example of  how friendship skips a generation – or as my mom often quotes, “The interest earned is dearer than the principle amount.” (a Marwadi proverb). With simple things like how the delicious food a wife or daughter-in-law (Geetanjali Kulkarni) makes stays unappreciated, Mukti Bhawan also comments on how the lady of the house is taken for granted. And of course, the film's comment on generation gap and changing times is unmissable. Will Sunita who makes supposedly selfish decisions take care of Rajiv, the way he took care of his father? Will the next generation have even lesser time than the current one? These questions also mean that the film stereotypes an entire generation. Yes, it does feel like the film is making a sweeping comment rather than talking about one Rajiv or one Sunita or for that matter even on Dayanath. For it also has a Vimla (Navindra Behl) who mentions her son, Ravi who behaves like Rajiv. That she is upbeat about it like Dayanath only deepens the stereotypes. Despite this annoyance, Mukti Bhawan's take on death is what makes the film worth a watch. It isn't an Anand-esque take, neither is it all morose. It is a tone of acceptance. You don't expect ordinary lives to have an extraordinary end.  That makes this small film larger than film – more because not many talk of life and death with this spiritual sense.

Awesome portrayal of detailed characters. Unfortunately, pace is slow enough to make it tiresome by the end.","Wherever in the world I’ve lived in the last 12 or so years, I have proudly called myself a Bombayite/Mumbaikar at heart. The city has an indescribable energy that sweeps me with it whenever I’m there. Mumbai Meri Jaan, however, is about various characters who don’t necessarily have such a romanticized view of Mumbai. Each of them goes through a phase of cynicism and ultimately accepts their situation as is and joins the “spirit” of the city. It’s a study of characters. Each character is interesting, even if not completely convincing. The combination of characters chosen is fascinating. The resistance to have extreme characters is obvious. Instead, a shade of gray is picked for each one and the variation in the grays, once in a while, defies believability. Yeah, it is also one possible interpretation of what might have been the state of mind of the citizens after the bomb blasts on July 11th, 2006. But, that seems secondary. The bomb blasts could very well have been replaced by any other traumatic event that Mumbai has gone through in the past few years. The focus is more on the social commentary on the economic disparity that the city suffers from, the corporatization of private lives by the media, the two sides of the youth wanting to migrate abroad, and so on.Like the city, Mumbai Meri Jaan is more about the people that make it what it is. Even the bit roles give you a glimpse into yet another character you might find in a city - spoilt rich brats, a sermonizing father, housewives for whom the bomb blasts must have just meant another event, and many more. The main characters, of course, have been dealt with in much more details.Nikhil, an idealist who pays his taxes, refuses to drain the country of it’s brain, considers changing his whole life around to deal with the trauma that the blasts bring about. R. Madhavan’s demure yet sure personality smoothly transforms into the troubled, paranoid Mumbaikar.  Rupali, the most regular brand of TV reporter, refuses to believe that she’s not exclusive. You see Soha Ali Khan turn into a zombie from the confident, aspirational lady she starts out as.  Thomas is a good-hearted slum-dweller whose favorite pass-time is to silently observe the rich and their ways. Irrfan Khan with minimal dialogue manages to convince us of his need to avenge the rich and the self-imposed redemption thereafter. Suresh, a racist, makes everything he sees fit into his conspiracy theory. What more can such a person need to substantiate his argument than an act of terrorism? Suresh’s transformation seems the laziest cop-out but Kay Kay Menon, like always, gives the character the body language and attitude that it demands. Tukaram Patil, at the end of his working life as a police officer, symbolizes the impotency of the police department. This clichéd character is one of the weakest ones. Paresh Rawal brings his amazing timing to the mostly well-crafted dialogues. His performance can certainly not be blamed for the character’s transition from a “go with the flow” attitude to giving “have better aims, do better with your life” sermons to his juniors. Any which way, one of the main purposes of the character seemed to be to thread the other characters together. The final speech that he gives seemed rather contrived, especially because the connection was not really necessary. Otherwise, the dialogues for all characters are charming because of their ruggedness.You know what all this character development means, right? More run-time. And that is Mumbai Meri Jaan’s biggest drawback, even to a patient viewer like me. The climax is one of the most subtle, yet strongest ones I’ve seen in Hindi cinema in recent times. Only the story tellers have taken 20-25 minutes too many to get there. I wonder how much more compelling the climax would’ve been if it had come earlier, before the audience had time to get bored.Albeit tongue-in-cheek and supremely clever, there’s an undercurrent of sarcasm running through the movie. This sarcasm points a big fat finger at the indifference of people towards others’ trauma. Now, taking a cue from the title, these people are from Mumbai. Sure, the climax serves as consolation for all the digs taken on Bombayites and ultimately it balances the tables. But, the effort to make it as unbiased as possible is unmistakable. And for that, despite being in love with Mumbai, I respect the story’s comment on its residents.

Yawn,"You can only sympathize with filmmakers who believe they are making a good, relevant film; who think they are being stylish by introducing the hero in slow-motion; who think their film is intelligent with chess-metaphors, explained in detail, no less. Only if these filmmakers sympathize with their audience who have seen it all, way too many times - in worse or better forms and in mediocre versions too. So, some of the specific problems of this particular crime drama which has the law and administration working hand-in-hand with the underworld are as follows -A non-performer in lead role, Sachiin Joshi. Even the makers are so insecure about his acceptance as a hero that a song has to be written to establish that - 'poster fatega toh hero hi niklega' (if a poster is being torn, the one coming through has to be the hero). Not only is his dialogue delivery flat, his voice doesn't seem to have broken all that well. Even though, Prakash Raj tries to infuse some sort of interest with his performance, he ends up being repetitive (also from his earlier films). Prashant Narayanan has too small a role to make any sort of impact.  Aditya Pancholi doesn't create any ripples with his role either. Sudesh Berry come in as a pleasant surprise and is entertaining with his accent which gets old within five minutes. The women have skimpily written roles for them to be talked about at all. This one has two villains, which should have worked in favor of the film. They corner the protagonist pretty bad too. Yet, because of the caricatures that they are and the genre of the film, you know how they are going to end up. Even so, they had the potential to get us interested by the soup that the hero lands up in with them. If only, he didn't get out of it so easily. The setting includes dance bars and drugs rendering itself to a lot of cleavage, pole dances and lousy lyrics set to lousier music. And yet, none of this is a surprise. It was close to what any of us might have expected.

Yet, there is enough to take away from the film.","The primitiveness of the ""Arranged marriage system"" troubles the urban youth but is certainly a fallback option for those who cannot find an alliance for themselves. Yet the discomfort doesn't go away. Films, especially Marathi films, have now and again tried to come up with novel ways to deal with this awkwardness. Mumbai Pune Mumbai is one of them and despite its impracticalness, the idea has potential. Besides the basic one line concept, the dialogue between two complete strangers is written really well and delivered in a decent manner too. The chemistry shared between people who have just met but for some reason or the other end up spending a day together is beautifully directed and enacted. While Swapnil Joshi behaves more like a 15-year old but it is fairly easy to ignore those moments considering his character's insight about relationships. The effort the writers have taken to address issues in a relationship is obvious. Concepts like being ""too loyal to ones' emotions"" or showing relief that a guy senses when he realizes that the crying girl is not upset because of him are some examples of the nuances captured. Ironically, the writing department is also one of the few issues that keep it from being a must-must watch in the theater. Almost as if to justify the title of the film, the Mumbaikar-Puneri fight is taken a bit too far. The other puller-downers are a little less basic. For example, the way in which the only song in the film was shot. It looked like the song existed because the lead actor refused to accept the role if he were going to be in the same outfit throughout the film. Another snag was the camerawork in some scenes. It felt like the cinematographer got bored of taking straight shots and resorted to weird angles just to entertain himself. Despite the above issues, the theory by itself is interesting enough to make it to your 'to watch' list. Especially, if you are on the hunt, the arranged marriage way.

Isn’t this a standard ingredient of our hit films?","Mumbai Pune Mumbai 2 - Where no word is enough to describe the superficiality of a film, where mediocrity knows no bounds or mediocrity wilfully breaks bounds, where brand endorsements are tolerable more than the film itself, where this supposedly romantic comedy is hopelessly unromantic, where the film shouldn’t have been a film in the first place, and yet, where no critique can prevent romantics from devouring it - you get the hang of what to expect or perhaps what not to. But, this is the least of anybody’s concern as long as fans are happy, they feel good about it, they feel romantic once again. Yes, I’m not its target audience. But I doubt Mumbai Pune Mumbai 2 can please the fans either, let alone generating new ones.Let’s start where it all started. The reason I had liked the slightly above-average Mumbai Pune Mumbai was its endearing setting – two characters, no costume change, minimalistic make up and locations, and most importantly, no standard plotline. You stay connected even when only dialogue channels the story, while forgiving Indian television-esque picturisation and lighting. Here we are, 5 years later, its sequel has superior resources, better camerawork, but overcrowded and flimsy characters. It takes off from where the previous one ended, involves the same lead pair and carries the name of the original as well. But that’s that. It doesn’t bring anything different to the table. What this film actually holds is a story we have run into a hundred times. Of course, this is peppered with our traditional masala formula. Yet, nothing stops it from being an overloaded extension, a terrible one though.If Mukta Barve’s character in the first film seemed introvert, demanding, determined and hopelessly romantic, we now see a lot of sudden changes in her as per writers’ convenience. Though not wrong, they want you to believe her confusion based on the way she orders her drinks. She is bold because she downs vodka glass after glass, really? And yes, she is indecisive too. She can’t decide between her ex-boyfriend and future husband. With her traits being the source of conflicts, our Puneri boy is devoid of conflict. All his agony is probably restricted to the last thirty minutes. But up to that point, he is unsurprisingly careless and open-minded. But all this boldness, broad-mindedness, sugar-coated smiles, happy-go-lucky attitude is tedious to a point where you don’t want to see it anymore. With mutual agreements, marriage rituals begin and so does the showiness.If this film was written well or wasn’t written at all, the makers would have saved you the agony of seeing same characters in the form of same faces. It could have probably looked bearably better with a powerful cast and direction. Without a doubt, such a film wouldn’t have found finances in the first place, let alone getting a release. When popularism outdoes content and box office results imply excellence, this is expected.

So, we have four. There is an attempt to touch upon some serious issues in relationships, while retaining a sense of humor. Unfortunately the humor is neither atrociously funny nor subtle. The serious parts lack novelty and punch. And neither can you take anything seriously nor can you sit back and enjoy the laugh.","Anyone who stays in a metropolis and is reasonably social will know people who remind them of each of the eight characters in the movie. But yet, neither do you identify with any of them nor do you feel good about/bad for any of them. Conclusion - the characters are reasonably well sketched out but the narrative doesn't engage you.Since the characters are regular people you aren't really expecting a never-imagined-before story. Four couples - four different types of love stories. Fair enough. Presumably each one represents a type of metropolitan relationship. But, does a story about regular people really make for an interesting movie? True, we crave for realism. But, it has to be insightful, leave a mark on your thought process. If a few laughs are what you want, you'll get those, but I don't think that is what the makers had in mind. They intended to make something more meaningful in a lighter vein, but light vein is all that we are left with.And there are a lot of inconsistencies. The funny lines make you laugh, thought not ""out loud"". And some supposedly funny situations don't do even that. The ""boss"" character was entirely avoidable. Introspective and/or emotional moments turn into lectures that you have imparted/listened to at some point in real life. And most likely, you used much better language. The writer has to be given due credit for inventing a new swear word though.The actors who deliver these lines aren't the best at their job either. The best of the lot, Manjari, is just about average in talent. Amruta is loud at most times, Neelam shouldn't have been given dialogues at all - certainly not English monologues. (Neelam's screen name is Xenobia and every time she came on screen the word ""Xenophobia"" kept popping into my head.) Anyway, none of the actors have the screen presence to make it work.The music could have been a little appealing had there been different tunes to different songs. Since almost all of them sounded the same, by the time you listen to the third song, you have reached the expiry date of the tune. The presentation is at best random. No sizzling dances to sweep you off your feet. Lyrics are by Sameer. Do I really need to say that they weren't interesting either? What was interesting though was the camerawork in one of the scenes. So, this is a movie about relationships, you have proposals and you have break-ups. Amidst all the ordinary camerawork, at one such break-up, you have the camera crew getting all creative on you. They take handheld camera shots as used in thrillers, thrilling background music et al. Technically, the entire scene looked completely out-of-place. Oh well. Mediocrity, thy name is Mumbai Salsa. Stories of our lives may seem interesting to us, but unfortunately they do not make watchable movies. So much for realism!

So you have Yetis, you have an ancient shape shifting Chinese emperor played by Jet Li, a good witch played by Michelle Yeoh (was the director paying tribute to Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or was he attempting to create a similar film?) along with the hero and the heroine (ostensibly middle aged and retired from the profession of saving the world from Mummies) and their strapping son, and the elixir of Immortality: all of this set in the Himalayas, Shangri La, Shangai, and England in the 1940’s.  You also have the mandatory special effects and crude attempts at comic relief thrown in.  Unfortunately the film just sinks into a morass, and never rises above it.  I had hopes from both Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh, but the director leaves them with nothing to do.  Jet Li is too wooden faced or clay faced to make a villain, Michelle Yeoh has about ten minutes of screen time.  The big climax is flaccid and looks like a lousy video game that you unfortunately cannot switch off. The action set pieces are highly contrived, and have nothing new to offer in terms of stunts or visuals, and the fight between Jet Li and Brendan Fraser is to put it simply, most doltish.
Imagine Jet Li being defeated by Brendan Fraser in hand to hand combat, ha ha! It is high time the producers stopped raising the Undead Mummies, to extort money from the living!  Will someone put a curse on them for all eternity?

It's one of those films where you come out with only the villain and what he is capable of. If you can handle creepy, sexual violence, go for it. It is sure to provide ""that"" kind of a thrill. ","People who take pleasure in causing pain to others - there are loads of movies/TV shows based on such characters. The psychos might have an agenda, or they are just wired that way. Either way, for a seasoned, Dexter follower, brutal serial-killers are hardly a phenomenon. Then I blame the sex part of the sexual violence that managed to creep me out, regardless of however experienced I am in watching their trade. Murder 2 reaches out to the primal fear in the woman in me. It might be a copy of another film or a dozen of them, I know not. It might have a dozen loopholes, and boy it does! But none of that matters. Your brain recognizes those gaps when it's watching the film, but it is just about processing the other sensations the film is producing. It can't be bothered with story details and such. I could go on about ""how come he knows this?"" and ""why doesn't the police do that?"" But if my skin is crawling with fear of the villain from scene one till end, the film has worked. The film works only and only because of its villain. Now whether it is because of Prashant Narayanan or Pandey (the character he plays), I wouldn't know. They are so one with each other. After you are out of the theater, you might analyze that it's never clear if the serial killer is confused about his sexuality and/or is ashamed of it. You might also realize that the violence you just watched wasn't really sexual in nature, but that's the ambience the film creates. I wonder if they had made these things more specific, how much more trauma it would have caused to my nerves. Being a person who doesn't enjoy such ""thrill"", I could also bear it only because Pandey didn't fit into my concept of a serial killer. He isn't neat in his work and he isn't careful. But I guess, there are more TV shows and films about only meticulous murderers than about the ones that got caught. Murder 2 is different in that aspect too. We know who the murderer is and he gets caught pretty early in the film too. He's in police custody and we still fear him. Because of what we saw in the promos or because we are worried sick for the innocent young girl who's 2-minute backstory makes you feel sorry for her. It is not as much her backstory as it is Sulagna Panigrahi's performance that does that to you. Brilliant casting, that. Which reminds me of Jacqueline Fernandez. Hah! I think the Bhatt's are brilliant with their marketing. They know their USP, and why the audience is really here. They lose no time in making Jacqueline lose her clothes. And once that is done, they start with the actual story. And that's it. She doesn't have anything to do after the couple of steamy scenes. And Emraan Hashmi. Well he does have stuff to do after the said scenes, but like I said Prashant Narayanan completely chews the scenery.Did I enjoy the movie? Hell, no. It is not at all my type. Did it achieve its purpose? Yep! It kept me uneasy throughout. And for the kind of people who are thrilled by such kind of violence, it might work even better. Does all of this make it a good film? While you are watching it, yes. But in hindsight, you see all the places it went wrong and wonder how much better it could have been. Anyway, like I always say, that would have been a different film though. Ps. If you haven't figured it out yet, this one has nothing what-so-ever to do with the Murder.

It draws up to 90 minutes. That's when the real story begins. The last 30-40 minutes of disclosure might just make it worth a DVD/TV watch. ,"You wait for the thrills and shrills to begin. You wait and you wait and you wait. Finally, an hour and a half later, you don't get the shreiks alright - thank goodness for some mercies - but you get a very interesting premise to hook you in. Too late? May be. Too little? May be.Just way too much time is spent on establishing a flaky love affair. You don't know why one has fallen in love with another or why stays in love either. Given the number of things to cause mistrust the love should've have fallen apart a couple of days into the relationship. Anyway, so, much-too-much love happens in South Africa, Goa, Mumbai and I'm sure a few other exotic locations. There is an air of mystery but as an experienced audience you have an inkling it's misleading. When, the real mystery is unveiled, you sit up. A world of possibilities opens up. A lot of test-of-character is bound to occur. These opportunities are utilized well too.The question then is whether or not you can forgive the time spent in getting there. Here, you should be warned that even the events of the last half hour are a tad predictable. Not necessarily because you are a step ahead of the makers or have seen it before, but because you are given that extra thirty seconds to guess what will happen next. And you are more likely than not going to guess right. Aditi Rao Hydari's performance too makes things engaging. I just hope she gets a role soon, that can use the talent she seems to have. Randeep Hooda and Sara Loren carry typical plastic expressions I associate with this genre of horror/thrillers produced. Randeep a little less than Sara, because of Sara's drone-like dialogue delivery. The background music tries hard to create spook and fails.  The camera doesn't try to pull anything outside the box. The songs are like any other recent product from the Bhatt factory. Why are the makers not willing to let go of these clichés? Why is it so difficult to go beyond? Especially when they have willingly accepted that they are drawing from another film - La cara oculta, Spanish this time.You cannot but help think - given a combination of a woman's instinct and her insecurity and a physical atmosphere of claustrophobia, Murder 3 ought to have arrested us.

127,827,827,827,827,Murder Mestri,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review,/movie/murder-mestri-review/,,,,2.633333333,"All the intended pun lies in its catchy title and dialogue with drab scenes. Straight out of the Marathi comedy films from the 80s, Murder Mestri boasts of an ill-conceived idea that drives superficial performances. Obviously, it leaves the movie wounded within.","The lone reason this appallingly-rookie writing is seeing the light of day is because of its catchy title. Sure, we have umpteen numbers of such cases, but Murder Mestri could well be unlike any other in the pack. Not because it is fused with technical prowess or it brags of a top-notch cast; but because it is deceiving – not just in its entirety, but in distinct pieces as well. Visual gimmicks and flashy camerawork deceive you. Superficial acts deceive you. Witty chatter in bad-tempered situations deceives you. Erroneous plots, which choke the narrative after a point, deceive you. An idea that sails under false colours deceives you. And so does the title.What the internet does today is what postcards could well have done in the 80s, letting people spy on others. So a postman, with unrestrained access to one’s personal life, could have his hands on a good-natured or a conflicting story to tell. While both can be equally rewarding, we here have a do-gooder whose peculiar tendency to read others’ letters affect the characters involved. Though this one-line premise indeed has some potential, the story hits a snag without any solid development in the plot. Halfway into the film, the focus shifts from this postman to the Mestris. If he is no longer driving the story, there is no mystery left for him to unravel. Never mind the story, just enjoy the jokes – goes the general saying. But as it turns out, it’s not a laugh riot either.As with any other sloppy picture, Murder Mestri too bites the dust as a result of its reckless script. Many a time, in fact almost every time, our comedies are built on one-liners alone and not the plot. This movie, so to speak, has nothing of its own to propose here. No wonder it adopts the age-old path blindly. And not being a meagre sitcom, it springs into something which it is not underneath, a thriller.Camera can be deluding as it is for this film. Images are lit and picturised well, but that alone can’t sum up its true motive. You are creating comedy through thrilling events, fine. But your camera just doesn’t get close to characters in order to make that happen. Therefore steps in western-inspired, noirish soundtracks to perk up your excitement. That’s another gimmick ill-used to fill the void left by directional mishaps. But, how far will it go to cover up non-technical aspects? Not that DP-director Rahul Jadhav is naive to set his camera right, but his incognizance with the subject costs the film dearly. He, along with the writers, do get certain elements right, but they are very few and far between.More often than not, Marathi films refuse to cast away their theatrical roots. And just because your story is conveniently set in the 80s or 90s, you can’t get away with film characters of that era. Appallingly, our makers are still stuck in the rhyme game to generate humour. As films set around Konkan have in common, Murder Mestri’s dialect sounds dubious to a point where I would’ve preferred it sans Malvani. And the language goes back and forth from Marathi as per the writers’ ease.I don’t remember a well-made Marathi comedy with brilliantly-shaped characters. Because nobody takes that extra effort. That’s also the reason why our great performers largely look forged, the problem Murder Mestri too is plagued with. The reason behind the postman’s act, for instance, is lame. Dilip Prabhavalkar’s rib-tickling act seemed to be the only thing I found engaging. But again, his part is not too different from his earlier comic capers. Let alone the pun on the genre, Murder Mestri is not a murder mystery in the first place. It’s a murder of writing and everything related.

The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is one such novel, which will never let you forget the narrative if you manage to read the book.  The movie adaptation is detailed, earnest, classy and a nail-bitter, all the ingredients needed to be successful detective film. Ultimately, the book is a much more interesting experience than the movie, but don’t make the mistake of missing the DVD which is one of the most genuine adaptations I’ve seen, managing to retain the complex flavours of the book. ","Over the years, and multiple adaptations later, I have always found myself on the side of books in the book versus film debate. This holds true especially for the Harry Potter Series, The Lord of the Ring Series and the Dan Brown books. However, British detective fiction adaptations are slightly different. The Bond movies are a separate entity from the books – with the suave style and dramatization of the character of Bond, and the picturesque visuals that the movies incorporate. Which is why a debate surrounding a DVD series of Christie’s The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd seemed like it would transgress mere extremes. BBC in collaboration with Carnival Films and ITV have been dramatizing Agatha Christie’s Poirot series since 1989, but if there is one DVD that a Christie reader should want to pick up it would be The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd. The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd deals with a series of murders in the quite English countryside, King’s Abbot, where Poirot had decided to retire. It starts with the murder of a wealthy businessman Ashley Ferrers, followed by the suicide of his wife, Dorothy Ferrers and then finally, her lover Roger Ackroyd, whose murder seems to be most peculiar. Poirot finds that the people around the victims are hiding much about their lives, and this forces him out of his retirement.The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd  has a romantic, serene picture and an old world charm to it – much like the language that the book uses. Christopher Gunning uses the violins as background music as a perfect blend to the calm flow and appeal of the narrative, but halfway through the movie you are slapped with an increasing pace of anxiousness. The movie carefully carves out that build up, which makes the film an interesting piece of detective fiction in isolation. A book like The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is multifaceted, deceptive and experimental – yet if one were to adapt it to a movie, there is only one-way to do it. The film has taken that route of transforming a 2-dimensional convoluted narrative, which determines the literary complexities of the structure into an easily narrated film. Poirot plays the part of merely a detective in the book, but in the film he becomes the central narrator. After watching one film, you want to go buy all the movies in the series, because you are left curious about the intricacies of the adaptations, and that is why this DVD series is such a delight – almost like a double treat. A near perfect adaptation of one of Christie’s most complicated novels and a detailed, classy who-dun-nit for those of you who haven’t read the book.Moreover, David Suchet is Poirot. The details are perfect in The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd , and other movies in the series. You’ll notice Poirot is exactly what you would have imagined him to be after reading Christie’s novels: quirky, observant, witty and unimaginably intelligent. Poirot is a typical detective, finding out the murderer before anyone can put together the pieces of the murders. Keenly observant of the smallest details and not willing to abandon even the most negligible clues.Having placed all the cards of this film on the table, it becomes essential to point out that no matter how well The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd   is adapted – which it is – there is nearly nothing like reading the book. It’s a separate experience of jaw-dropping exhilaration. Watching the movie on the other hand is like assuming the position of an all-knowing parent – who knows the value of original but wants to applaud the courage of an earnest and striking visual adaptation. The debate has the same conclusion but watching The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd   will make you feel like it’s a win-win situation.

It’s almost as if you’re ruffling through the pages of a character’s life, in the most ordinary day-to-day manner. Yet, you remain the outsider who has symbolic observations and opinions about the stories.The beauty of such a narrative can be seen in films like Chungking Express and In the Mood for Love - where every character and every story neatly takes its time to reveal its facets. Emotions become like a silent character: Desire in Chungking Express and Loneliness in In the Mood for Love, molding into the parallel narratives. The film revels in its plurality but even so you feel a sense of connection – with the emotions, the characters and the slow brewing of a cumulative story.My Blueberry Nights, Wong Kar Wai’s first English language film, however, is undercooked. A film about a New York girl Elizabeth (Norah Jones) who on getting her heart broken, tries to find solace in the Blueberry pie from Jeremy’s (Jude Law) café. Unable to cope with the pain, she travels from one state to another – Memphis, Nevada, picking up temporary jobs to keep up. She meets quirky people along the way (A heartbroken cop and his ex – David Strathairn and Rachel Weisz – and a compulsive gambler – Natalie Portman) who serve as distractions to her pain.My Blueberry Nights’ first problem is Norah Jones. Her vacant expression steers far from being mysterious and secret-bearing. To feel a sense of physical and emotional travel through a film that takes on a journey it becomes absolutely essential to relate with the protagonist. She looks her part, but the credit for that also goes to the indicative lighting and background score, much like most of Wai’s films that also use the ambience to tell the story.As Elizabeth becomes Lizzie and Beth in the different cities, the characters she meets are enchanting but only in isolation. As a viewer you might only be able enjoy the pure essence of a passing character when you’re able to mark a difference/similarity or random comparison to main protagonist – especially in a film that vows to explore relationships and human emotions. The only connection through the film comes in the form of postcards that Jeremy writes to her. The problem with that is you can sense a predictable end to this wandering tale of discovery, with every postcard. It’s the first 10 mins of the film that stay with you – during Elizabeth and Jeremy’s interaction, which bring out Wai’s true stylistic traits as an auteur. The setting is moody; the dialogues are not spoken but heard in the form of background music. It is when Elizabeth trails off on her personal journey of whatever it is she is seeking, you lose interest in her or her life and you aren’t given enough time to develop an interest in the new characters. The true perpetrator of a story in My Blueberry Nights is the soundtrack of the film. Background score changes as per the city she travels to – we get to hear Cat Power crooning in her folksy/indie demeanor the New York sequences. The film opens with Norah Jones’ own song ‘The Story’. We travel to Ry Cooder and country music while in Memphis and end up with an assortment of Neil Young/Amos lee blues while in Nevada. It’s the soundtrack that urges you to stay with the story longer and to make personal connections.The DVD includes interviews with Wai and Norah Jones, plus raw footage from the film. The interview with Wai brings us to realize that his treatment for My Blueberry Nights, one of his latest movies, remains similar to his previous movies – he is still trying to explore the play of emotions in a character’s life, and their reactions that brings the story forward.My Blueberry Nights however falls short of connecting. It lingers around with its colorful melodies and moody frames, but before you can shift and get on with the narrative you end up losing interest in what it has to offer. If you are a regular viewer of Wong Kar Wai films however, I urge you to let this mistake pass you by. Drool over Jude Law, hum the soundtrack and watch another of his film’s after this one.

132,832,832,832,832,My Friend Pinto,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review26 Critic Reviews 0.5/5.0 40 Tweet Reviews 3.2/5.0,/movie/my-friend-pinto-review/,0.5/5.0,,3.2/5.0,4.35,My Friend Pinto is another one of those dark comedies - the ones that have a series of disconnected threads conspiring to unite. The threads get weirder and weirder and thus funny. Except in My Friend Pinto the situations lose focus of the genre and become outright childish and gimmicky. ,"As regular as boy-meets-girl stories are becoming common for the regular movie-watcher, the spate of dark comedies and noir is becoming for the quirky movie-watcher. Interestingly, the same analogy applies to mindless comedies. You need to put your brain away to watch a Priyadarshan comedy or a David Dhawan film, almost as much as you need to keep your gray cells at bay to give up on the number of coincidences required to make a ""separate threads collide"" story. Only difference is that the latter has a zing in both cases, just because of the quirky treatment. And My Friend Pinto is just that amount of quirky, no more, no different. Just average in its genre.It's not like there isn't enough meat in those disconnected threads or how they are played out. It is fun and cute, but it deviates from the chosen narrative-style a little way too often. What are pillow fights and people romantically flying in clouds doing in a film with the most unlikely underworld dons. These dons they are rather eccentric as required by this type of films, but the portrayal is too cartoon-ish, too amateur to make an impact. The actors don't seem to help the cause either, the show very easily and a little too often slips into slapstick mode. Prateik Babbar is the protagonist, the village fool, the grown-up man who never grew up. And we are being treated to a night in his life where the craziest things happen to him. This one required no ""performance"" by him, he looked like the dumb/naïve person he plays in most other films  (other than Jaane Tu...). Kalki Koechlin barely has a role to play. I really liked her in the one song that she has with Prateik Babbar. That song has also been picturised very well. Watch out for the choreographed water splashing. It's an awesome visual.Other than that My Friend Pinto, is as regular as it gets in the movies we can directly compare it to. We, of course, have seen worse films in general, but in this bracket, whatever My Friend Pinto has to show is covered, and whatever it has to say is too wishy-washy for the kind.

But unfortunately, in the last hour the movie leaves the US and enters K-Jo-land. And in both worlds Kajol intolerably shrieks her way through.","Simran and Raj have grown up. They have crossed a few hurdles in the past 15 years, and now they face new ones. They are left to now deal with terrorism and racial divides. Director Karan Johar has grown up too and shows respect to his growing audience too. There isn't super-sappy emotional drama. There is no over-the-board filmy dialogue. There aren't frolic-y dances. All HUGE plusses. But, every once in a while melodrama takes a quick peek, and by the end it takes over. The lines aren't super-mushy but they are still belong to Utopia. And the background score takes over the gap left by the song and dance sequences. If I could give marks to improvement that a director, this movie deserves garlands, accolades, awards, and more. Surely, when something as sappy as ""We shall overcome"" gives me goose bumps, the director has done something very, very right. But, if a movie was only rated for the mistakes it didn't make, all credit would be taken away from films that don't have any intention of making them in the first place. And the argument could go round and round in circles. Well, then let's focus on what they did. I was wondering, if there was any need at all to bring in the ""autism"" angle at all? And I realized the film wouldn't be engaging at all if that wasn't a part of the whole schema. Shah Rukh Khan, would then be Shah Rukh Khan. And there is zero-tolerance for that. But, here his character, Rizwan, suffers from this syndrome which gives Shah Rukh completely different material to deal with. The permanent cock-eyed-ness, the no-eye-contact with any character for the entire length of the film, the restricted body movement - all keep you attached to Rizwan and far way from Shah Rukh. And kudos to the latter for that! :) No people, that was not the only purpose of making Rizwan suffer from Asperger's. Here’s this person who had difficulty identifying emotions let alone expressing them. He just follows one guiding principle, ""That he is a good human being and will not let bad enter him."" Now, when a person with a low EQ knows that, how can we as a head and a heart allow bad things to happen in this world. Beautiful, ain't it? Unfortunately, anything with such high sentimental content has to give way to sappiness. Though, Karan Johar and his team of writers do manage to keep a huge chunk out for most of the film. The last 40 minutes complete lose all sanity. The moment you see a mother who has just lost her son change into whites while her child is lying still in the house, you know this film has very little hope, now on. Though, ironically, it's trying to say there is hope.

Add to this drop, a super-shrill Kajol throughout the film. The lady's voice is high-pitched when she's excited/happy and piercingly so when she's upset/sad. Considering that, there are only two main characters whose personalities we are exposed to; it is actually heartbreaking to see zero chemistry between the two. Save a couple of ""moments"", there is no romance in this love story. However, you do see a lot of romance between the camera and its subjects. The arid deserts, the city sky-lines, and the general magnificence of the US is covered beautifully. The puller-downer is that it is almost like it was shot for their makemytrip.com advertisements.Given all of this, I might have urged all of you to wait for the DVD for the first two hours of the film and would have also equally vehemently urged you to skip the last 40 minutes or so. But given the ""illogical"" conditions revolving around the release of the film, I'd say - all those keen to support the entire team of My Name Is Khan should go watch it in the theaters. It is not a waste of money, time, energy and certainly not a waste of your courage.

134,834,834,834,834,My Week With Marilyn,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review2 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/my-week-with-marilyn-review/,,4/5.0,,3.633333333,"During an interview, Monroe was asked, “What do you wear to bed?” to which she replied,”Five drops of Chanel no 5.” It’s this provocative nature of THE Marilyn Monroe that we all love. My Week with Marilyn explores much more about her character, that isn’t restricted to her seductive public persona, and even though it is a subject that isn’t too new, it’s worth an engaging watch. ","Once during a flimsy duty-free spree I happened to catch a whiff of Chanel no. 5, also Marilyn Monroe’s famously endorsed fragrance – and I knew in a second why she was chosen as brand ambassador. It was a naughty scent; a teasingly stimulating musk, one that lingered on for a couple of hours, strong yet subtle and blotches of a sweet jasmine-y smell. I could picture Monroe standing atop a platform, with her dress flying saying, “that’s how I smell, lovelies”. As I watched My Week with Marilyn, I remember those moments in the duty free section. Michelle Williams in the film, based on a book by Colin Clark is an absolute stunner. While the film might be a tad bit weak, story wise, feeling a bit repetitive and clumsy, Williams is like the bottle of Chanel no. 5. She’s not the real deal; not nearly close to it (that’s also because there has only been ONE Monroe), but every moment she appears on screen, you share her conviction, with which she acts out a lovely, sassy rendition of Marilyn Monroe. The film is set in 1956, and told to us from Clark’s point of view. Clark (played by Eddie Redmayne) is an aspiring filmmaker, who finally gets his break as a third assistance director in the England shoot of The Prince and the Showgirl. He meets Marilyn Monroe – and much like his first time, Williams introduction as Monroe in the film, blows our minds too. She’s all about charm. And of course, she’s a difficult actress – always late, messing her lines, questioning the director’s call and other quirks. She develops a soft corner for Clark, for his meekness and awe of her. Through their (warped) relationship –Clark’s and Monroe’s – we see much discussed traits of her character. Her loneliness, insecurities and brashness is shown to us from Clark’s point of view. It’s not a diva behavior we as audiences are alien to, we’ve all read quite a bit on Monroe. It’s the idea that Clark as her confidant gets to see a side of hers that isn’t restricted to her sultry public persona that is a big win. We see a dreamy, questioning Monroe as she confidently does what she’s best at in The Prince and The showgirl. But we also see a disturbed side of hers, as she speculates and gets dangerously close to Clark through the film.There are drawbacks in My Week with Marilyn, though. First one being the script: it’s repetitive and doesn’t bring forward anything new. The film is extremely performance heavy; without Williams’ colorfully sensual performance of Monroe the film would be quite flat. The film has some standout dialogues though. But much accolades to Williams for bringing out the camera-loving side of Monroe. It’s a hard task, because Monroe had the notoriously sex-kitten face, that every single human I know has stopped to look at twice at some point in their lives. It’s naughty, period. While Williams' face is a lot more simplistic and pleasing, you tend to let your mind wander every now and then.You’ll notice how most of this review is about Marilyn versus Williams as her, as opposed to a review of the film. That is exactly what you move out with, once the film is over. You might not even like the film that much, as it’s not a story that’s adding anything new to your life or one that stays with you. Clark (Eddie Redmayne) as an infatuated boy is a natural, and a perfect catalyst to bring out the nostalgia of Marilyn Monroe.But most of all, My Week with Marilyn belongs to Michelle Williams; for sheer gut to be able to make audiences accept her “different” portrayal and for making us want to curse ourselves for not being born during the 50s.

135,835,835,835,835,My girl,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/my-girl-review/,,,,3.633333333,"My Girl is a film about friendship – not just with your childhood best friend or with your most prized possession but with the many forgotten, yet significant people who you met when you were younger and contributed to your personality and most of all with a younger, more innocent ""You"" – who is the foundation of what you are today. ","Most women I know have admitted to hating or being scared at the thought of having children. It’s surprising actually; they’re all killing the cliché about women loving babies. Even so, you’ll usually see people fawning over infants, children below the age of 7 or 8. Let’s face it, when was the last time you heard someone say, “OMG, I met the most adorable 11 year old!”? In Howard Zeif’s My Girl, however, you end up feeling a surging love for the two lead 11-year olds, Vada (Anna Clumsky) and Thomas J (Macaulay Culkin, yes the Home Alone kid). My Girl is a story about two kids and their innocent, starry-eyed lives as they move through life’s offerings.Vada is a hypochondriac attention seeker – typical pre-teen, who feels like the world’s coming to an end because her father, who owns a funeral parlour, has found new-found love in his make-up artist (Jamie Lee Curtis). She confides her crazy theories, intellectual rants and thoughts in Thomas J, her only friend. The setting is very ""The Wonder Years"" like; both kids face the regular troubles of a pre-teenage; You can sense a deep, deep friendship between the two – one they might not even be aware of. He claims Vada is his girl (via a more mature voiceover that gages the film) – and that’s how you can see exactly why the movie is called so.Vada’s father (Dan Ackroyd) is a typical sitcom father –one who instills enough into Vada but is ignorant of her needs and questions. It’s her relationship with her father, and her fears that leads to her personality – one of questions, admirations, astonishments and an endearing naiveté. Jamie Lee Curtis as Shelly is smart and appealing – it’s through her that we realize Vada’s issues with her father and relationships in general.The beauty of My Girl is the ability to see the two characters in a pure coming-of-age story. You often want to just make them sit in front of you with cookies and milk, and you want to talk to them. Tell them how lucky they are to be that young, and innocent, free from opinions and pressures. When the film gets over, you’ve lived an entire circle with the characters, and you’ll be left wishing there was more.Vada’s relationship with the other characters in the film is remarkably told. She and her father share a very on-off, negligible relationship, and it’s a refreshing change to see a father-daughter relationship that isn’t either abusive or saccharine sweet. Vada’s teacher Mr Bixler (Griffin Dunne) is sensitive and very profound in his ability to invoke the wondrous thoughts in Vada. The background score includes many classic-cult hits from the time (the movie’s set in 1972). It’s like a full-blown emotional nostalgic trip, the film. The DVD of My Girl has no extra features but here’s why you should buy it. As a child there are many questions that are left unanswered – some your parents want you to figure on your own, some you overhear and some you just never understand. My Girl doesn’t set out to answer them – it just allows you to enjoy the unanswered, free-spirited and naïve childhood everyone should have.

A couple is driving to a party, engaging in the regular couple banter. You know danger is looming. You know because you have seen the trailer. Like the beginning of a typical Hindi horror film, the couple walks into the mouth of the lion that is going to gnaw it down. But, unlike the horror film, NH10 grips you by the collar and clenches at it through the two hours. When was the last time you could say that about a film? Even if you are uncomfortable through the length of the film.And this is when you are prepared for the film. The trailer has ample warning, in fact over-preps you for the film's intensity. You go in expecting the worst things happening to the lead lady and even though they don't manifest, the discomfort is relentless. From the word go, the writing hits upon taboo, gender divide, status of women in our society. Even before you get to the crux of the film, a scare is brought in. Much like newspaper headlines with shocking news day after day, tirelessly, the film hits you with one scary face of society and human being after another. So much so that you wonder if we are that any more - social or human. Arjun (Neil Bhoopalam) and Mira (Anushka Sharma) are like two sides of you – scared and yet moved from the inside, enough to want to do something about the injustice that makes the world. There is no overt social message, but you are unsettled. Arjun and Mira, an urban couple, want to protect another couple which is being beaten up by their own family for dishonoring the family and caste. But, NH10 is not only about honor killing or safety of women and so on. It is more a pointer at what human beings are capable of – when she is blinded by her beliefs or he wants to prove he's macho or they are blinded by a need for revenge. In any of these cases, they don't want or trust the system, they want control over their own matters. Through this myriad of thoughts, the tension - through background music (or lack thereof), the camera work – stays just right. The chases, the situations are such that when you get respite from the build-up, you are ready for it. Despite your admiration for how real the situation is and constantly thinking about what you'd do if you were in their place, you welcome that relief in the form of a background song or an emotional scene or a cinematic liberty. Even though you know those wouldn't come to your rescue in real life. Unfortunately, these same things takes away from the film. They remind you, you are only watching a film, after all. As much as you want to believe the ridiculous coincidences, they disconnect you from the characters and the situations who you were so close to, just a second ago. Even so, it is a thriller indeed. A thriller so well-made that as I reach towards the end of what I want to say about the film, I haven't yet spoken about the most striking thing about the film - the performances. While you could call Neil Bhoopalam the hero(?) of the film, and he does his bit convincingly, your hatred toward Darshan Kumaar's Satbir takes up your emotional energy. And of course your worry for Mira. Anushka Sharma has given it her all. You are watching Mira, a person you might see at a candle-light vigil, the woman who wants to make a place in this world of men (a world where an all men-committee decides how to sell a female hygiene product), a person who cares about a security guard doing his duty – a person like you and me. And even while, neither you nor I would like to be in the situation Mira finds herself in, we would all like to be like her when push comes to shove. Especially, in the climax. But, for a film which attempts to keep things real, the climax is outlandish. The drama, a little over-stated. I guess, like the characters of the film, from the film-makers point of view too, it is a “you gotta do what you gotta do.”What stays though is that despite the intentional laxity in the writing, your muscles stay taut. The mind stays worked up and alert thinking of what you would do in real life, despite the unreal coincidences. Most of all, the intensity doesn't leave you long after you've left the theater. How many thrillers can you say that about?

Bad news: That is not qualification enough to make a film good.,"The first fear of many non-Askhay Kumar fans, especially after watching the trailer was that Naam Shabana will become more about him than the protagonist, Shabana (Tapsee Pannu). To Akshay Kumar fans' dismay that is thankfully not true. Unfortunately though, just having a female protagonist who swiftly beats men up doesn't make for a good thriller. You know what that means right? Neither of the two sections of the audience mentioned above are likely to be satisfied. Whenever a film has two distinct sections it raises a flag in my head. Does each one hold interest as a stand-alone story? Usually neither is. Such films have to work more than double of working on a single story because the connection is all important and shouldn't feel contrived. Is the connect between the two stories strong and interesting? Most likely that isn't there either. Unfortunately, that's true of Naam Shabana too. The episodic aspects of the story have question marks written all over them too. For instance, Shabana's plan before interval is rather tactless or for a very smart and dreaded villain it is strange that he doesn't know he is being followed. To top it all off, the screenplay is ridden with an unnecessary mysterious ambiance.All this slows down an already slo-mo-aided film. Sure, some directorial decisions are subtle and nicely done such as the aerial views of cities – from Mumbai to Vienna to Kuala Lampur; choosing not to add a couple-bonding-while-falling-in-love montage; choosing not to explain rules of the sport Shabana is playing; picking a rather mundane location as a meeting spot for characters which sticks in audience's memory to be retrieved later in the film. In one swift interaction between characters the writers address religion, call sport a waste of time, comments on soldiers and even slides in a sexist remark. Later in the film, there is even a dig at corporates taking advantage of “free” mentality (Jio?). You could debate the point of view, but the writing brought a smile. You also smile as you wonder why only Shabana needed all this training while the male field agents got by with paunches. Despite some parts of the film seeming over-directed through camera angles, background music, awfully edited action sequences and slow-motion, the subtlety mentioned above and some of the character nuances work. Shabana is introduced as a woman who will not be wronged even if she is not entirely right through a sequence rather than a voiceover. That in itself is fresh. Tapsee Pannu adds to the character by the slightest shift in expression. You discover that Shabana likes being wooed by this one guy but she corrects her emotions within a few seconds – and you can see this transition through Tapsee Pannu. On the other hand Manoj Bajpai seems uni-dimensional and Akshay Kumar comes across as comic relief. While I will let you wonder if Shabana has to play the “woman” card, what I really admired that the makers mostly resisted giving her anything glamorous. The only thing that could be remotely called glamorous is that this seemingly middle class girl almost never wore the same set of clothes twice.Given these things that were done well, the pace of the film could have been forgiven. But, it is difficult to forgive no pounding hearts in a thriller. When the protagonist feels too safe, nothing can make you worry about her, can it?

Let down by its writing choices, this surprisingly sincere effort leaves you disgruntled in the end.","Shyam Jagdale. What a name for a political journalist to begin with! Its intensity grabs me straight off. But, what could make me stay with him is the enormity of the political games he is made to watch silently. Such a nightmarish situation could surely drag his downright honesty into an uphill task. More so, his battle of ideologies and principles are bound to bring inevitable struggles, unpredictable developments and, obviously, spine-chilling rides. Whether he succeeds or not, I am more concerned about his approach leading up to the end. Nagrik intends to tackle this with virtually non-existent drama at the start. And I am glad it opts to do so. Having said that, it heavily relies on extrinsic emotions through excessively-served, revealing dialogue. This slays the joy of exploring certain events on your own.Lighting is mostly spectacular, so is the camerawork. With its vivacious visual treatment, Nagrik seeks to uncover the underbelly of Bombay drowned in the world of dirty politics. Such is its symbolic detailing that scores of visuals themselves speak volumes. Yet, the makers feed you words which add no weight to the ongoing action. There is an unwanted urge to tell you every tiny detail. Instead of desperately reciting someone’s gruesome past or someone’s looming future, they could have let you figure it out. It could probably take you a while to grasp, but it would keep you engrossed. This and the story development, hinders Nagrik's potential to be a well-made, socio-political conspiracy.Shyam resonates as a strong, fearless journalist. He knows his abilities, and Sachin Khedekar adds to the believability. But something feels wrong seeing him break down at the escalating nexus between politicians, industrialists and media. Given the character of his stature and experience, it should not come as a surprise to him. And having known his limitations in such a setup very well, his agitation lacks significance. This reminds me of Nilu Phule’s inane crumbling in Sinhasan – another elaborate, but lame political drama. Both acts leave me baffled for the changes they undergo.Hindu-Muslim tensions inarguably possess enough material for a dramatic narrative. But here, it’s just another layer within the story. Nagrik’s minimalistic outline gives very little or no scope to drama – a rare and bold decision. What counts from here on are eventful moments. Implicating certain politicians doesn’t offer any solution to the worsening conditions of the city, the state or the country for that matter – something Shyam is well aware of. The story does draw you closer to varied social issues through him. But by being preachy about them, the desired outcome goes amiss.Rarely does a Marathi film sound wonderful. I felt stranded in rain as a scene hovered before my eyes. That’s the oomph factor of its sound mixing. And then Sambhaji Bhagat's poignant verses help Nagrik reach an entirely new height. “Manoos Marala” – which he wrote after the 1993 Bombay Riots – is adopted and observes women’s viewpoint towards the massacre. I am swept over as it goes on to remonstrate our way of living. It’s indeed an exemplary feather to the narration.All actors perform to the best of their ability, even with little screen time. Devika Daftardar looks close to reality like any other actor, only until a revelation is made. I wish I could assert a fundamental flaw in her hair, among other, had it not led to divulging a subplot. But it shouldn’t cause you to spurn the film which is worthy of praise, even with its inadequacies.

Worked for some, didn't work for the rest of us. Akshay Kumar gives an appreciably controlled performance and while Katrina Kaif gives her best so far, yet leaves loads of room for improvement. The story has way too many holes. Then again, we can't expect anything more in a romantic comedy.","I felt sad while watching this movie…really really sad. No, it had nothing to do with the generally predictable storyline. It was also not because I saw too many genres being mixed to no particular end. It was the songs. Don’t get me wrong, they had awesome lighting! I am certainly not saying I expected better from Himesh Reshammiya. Its not the video album style picturisation either. But, Jaaved Saahab? “Aanan-Faanan”, “Rafta rafta”, “Chakna chakna”? Your poetry has moved me to tears many a time, and this time too, but obviously for all the wrong reasons. I am grieving because it feels like we are losing you Sir, to the inane-word-rhyming competition. Oh well, coming back to the story. It heavily draws from , Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (the sacrificing husband), Purab Aur Paschim (the patriotism bit). Cinematically, the parts shot in Punjab reminded me of Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge. One scene particularly reminded me of Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahi - would give away a little more than I like, if I said which one. In that sense then, they were original because they were the ones who thought of the combination! While there are some scenes that go contrary to your predictions, they are so unreal or out-of-place with the characterizations that they would make more sense as dream sequences. Akshay Kumar almost plays himself – a Punjabi dude who listens to music on an ipod while sporting a pink silk kurta – but with a remarkable amount of restraint. He doesn’t get loud or go over-the-top. The flaw is actually in his character which forgets his Jatt pride because he is head-over-heels in love with the lady of his life. Katrina looks dainty and has her share of expressions. This might very well be her best performance till date. Wait dear, that is not a compliment just yet. Javed Shaikh (Parvez Khan) could use a lesson or two from Rishi Kapoor and Nina Wadia (his wife) for body language and dialogue delivery. The only reason for Upen Patel’s track to exist is the ‘Western Union’ advertisement. I kid you not, they had to put an advertisement they had shot with Upen Patel and Katrina Kaif in it and that is why they chose this cast. That would also explain why Upen Patel was acting like he was a model – to maintain consistency. The entertainment in the movie is very sporadic. There are two sequences which really work because of their humor. These are not jokes you could narrate; it’s the way it’s done on screen that makes you laugh your heart out. That I guess makes the movie a comedy. There are a couple of emotional scenes where you really feel sorry for Arjun (Akshay Kumar). There’s the romance for you. Then there is the routine of a foreigner belittling the capabilities of Indians, and an Indian giving it back to them and rightly so, with a slap across their face but sans violence. The good thing about the dialogue is that it is well delivered and that it doesn’t get preachy about Indian culture and tradition. It just states facts. Soon enough, it digresses into some irrelevant facts and loses all grace. It’s the reinforced stereotypes that got tiring. The racism - all white people (except one in this case) are mean to Asians and don’t take a breather before ridiculing them. The fight of cultures - all the second generation immigrants do is drink, shop and party. And all first generation Indian immigrants make no attempt to socialize with the natives of the country they migrate into. In fact, they are so desperate to get their daughter an Indian groom, that they take pride when an Indian guy eve-teases her?!? Why is it painted so black and white and inevitably the black turning into white (no pun intended)? Anyway, shouldn’t patriotism be stimulated more often than the few times an Indian actor gives a mouthful to the side character – who exists for the sole purpose of being whacked verbally anyway– in a movie? Shouldn’t we wait at least until a match starts before bashing our cricket team? Oh, look who is digressing now…Maybe, its pure bad timing. Two movies released in a day both of which deal with the troubles of NRIs and the cultural disparities. Three in eight days. Too much of the same thing not presented in a very different way?

Especially considering there was nothing very unique or great about the story itself. I was mesmerized by Tabu’s acting. Simple day-to-day dialogues and none, if not necessary added to the elegance of the movie.","In general, I like movies which have a strong compelling story. Once in a while though, comes along a movie like ‘The Namesake’ where the direction, screenplay and most importantly - the acting make you forget that the story is ‘nothing spectacular’. And this is despite the fact that it is relatively slow paced.The story is no doubt a truthful and authentic narration of the average NRI family who moved abroad in the 70s - from the locations and sets to the accents and reactions of various characters. Especially, how Tabu and Irrfan lose the heavy Bangla accent gradually as the years go by. This could also mean that people who haven’t lived outside India for an extended period of time might not identify with the characters. They will enjoy the narrative nevertheless. While the characters of Ashima (Tabu) and Ashoke (Irrfan Khan) are sketched out in quite some detail and are played out beautifully, some parts of Gogol’s (Kal Penn) character seemed superficial, especially his love life. By any standards, this is a Tabu movie all the way. The lady gracefully ages from a daughter to a wife to a mother. It is amazing how with just one movement of her eye, you know exactly what her character is feeling.However, since it is a movie that tries to be as close to reality as possible, it is the missing nuances that bothered me a couple of times during the two hours. I must admit that I haven’t read the book, and this could be one of those things that didn’t find their way into the movie. High on emotions and jerking tears along the way, this one is worth a watch just for the performances. The beauty lies in the depth of the relationships touched upon. This is one of those rare occasions where how the story is told consumes the audience rather than the story itself.Update: Corrected spelling mistake - 'Ashim' replaced by 'Ashima'. Thanks Ashima (Comment #1 on notepad).

141,841,841,841,841,Nanban,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review3 Reader Reviews 2/5.0,/movie/nanban-review/,,2/5.0,,3.1,"Shankar’s 3 Idiots remake, Nanban, is an easy, enjoyable one-time watch for someone who has not seen Rajkumar Hirani’s blockbuster – a largely endearing cast ensures this. However, for those who have seen 3 Idiots, it can prove to be quite cumbersome because it differs in absolutely no way from the original. There is only so much one can take of silly cinema pretending to be seriously funny.","Senthil, Venkat and Pari are three engineering students of the prestigious Ideal Engineering College run by the terrifying Virumandi Santhanam better known by his students as ‘Virus’. Sound familiar?That Shankar’s latest flick, Nanban, is a remake of the highest grossing Indian film of all time – Rajkumar Hirani’s 3 Idiots - is no secret. Shankar isn’t exactly the greatest exponent of the art and craft of cinema. But he has always been someone I have admired, simply because he has the ability to close his eyes and visualize bigger than most other Indian filmmakers. What is truly disappointing though is that this time round, when Shankar closed his eyes, he saw exactly what Rajkumar Hirani did. The characters, their idiosyncrasies, their nicknames (and shockingly, even a continuity goof!) remain the same. Any attempt by me at not giving the movie away would be futile, considering that about a billion people have already watched 3 Idiots. There is no doubt about the fact that, as a standalone film, Nanban is fairly enjoyable. In fact, in my opinion, the script of 3 Idiots actually lends itself more towards being cinematically adapted in Tamil than in Hindi because character quirk-driven comedies are often funnier in South Indian languages.Nanbanmotors along largely because it has a competent cast who look their parts. Though not too far away, Vijay is still on the right side of 40, which is to Shankar’s credit, unlike Mr. Hirani who hoped that the audience would look the other way. More importantly, Vijay looks closer to his supposed age than our own self-anointed champion of ‘sensible cinema’ did in 3 Idiots. Jeeva and Srikanth are extremely likeable in the roles played by Sharman Joshi and Madhavan respectively. Even Sathyan is a darn sight better than Omi Vaidya. Sathyaraj as Virus is convincing and succeeds in not turning his character into an overt caricature. Ileana (playing Kareena Kapoor’s character) looks gorgeous and has an arresting screen presence. The music by Harris Jayaraj is pleasant and easy on the ears. Most tracks are hum-worthy, though a few tracks are unwanted in the flow of the film. While this phenomenon of remakes and ‘sequels’ is anyway the worst thing to happen to cinema since Tusshar Kapoor, a remake can be accepted if it brings at least something new to the table. ‘Nanban’ was never going to shake off the ‘been-there-seen-that’ feeling. However, it is absolutely unforgivable that an official remake so shamelessly copies the original, the change in the very nature of the core target audience notwithstanding. I always enjoy listening to my co-audience react to what they see on screen, and this time was no different. However, I must confess, I had to get the PVR guys to remake a couple of cups of coffee for me to go the distance.

Of course, Rajasthan has been covered beautifully umpteen times earlier. It's the slightly unusual ""little story"", the justifiable ""dance"", and the restrained ""comic relief"" that make it different. Although different isn't always good, this time around it is. The mature treatment given to a kids' movie is good enough for me to give it a few extra brownie points. Samir Karnik should certainly start acting classes for children. The performance that he has extracted from debutant Dwij Yadav is one of the best I have seen from a child artist in a long time. Unfortunately, that can't be said of the adults. Fortunately though, the adults don't have too much screen time (yes Bobby Deol too! Now will you go and watch the movie?). And none of them, graciously enough, tried to over-shadow Dwij. It is his movie and the whole team let it be that way.The structure of the story is pretty conventional. Problems are presented in the first half, and their resolutions are sought out post-interval. The pacing was rather interesting - but ultimately a drawback. The problems are presented so subtly and slowly in the first half that you feel nothing has happened so far. As the last hour begins, you wonder how they are going to wrap everything up in such little time. Of course, they do bring a closure to everything, and have to understandably do it quickly. My issue is that the first half was interesting, and the second half sort-of dull. I blame it largely on the avoidable, although endurable, preachy set-up. One could claim that it was the need of the story, but it became boring. The few long shots of the town of Jaisalmer are beautiful, but seem repetitive. The lighting in the night shots of the lake is exquisite and achieves the romanticism it intends to. The close-ups however seem artificial. Watch out for the clever editing used to cover up Bobby Deol's dancing non-skills. And this is despite the relatively simple choreography employed. Music for the title song and ""Kesariya"" is shockingly unlike this music director. It might be similar to others' music, but not this one. And before you can recover from the shock, you are back to trade-mark Himesh Reshamiya crooning in ""Lamha Lamha"", ""Akhiya akhiya"", and ""ulfat ulfat"". Given the repetitive use of repetition, need I say more about the lyrics? Or maybe it's just Himesh's musical requirement.Never mind. Ultimately this is an adorable movie made out of an equally lovable kids' story. The endearing bit is that it does not sport the ""what do kids know?"" attitude. Of course, this is once you are done laughing at the fact that Bobby Deol is being presented as the best star that Bombay has produced. Soon enough, you begin admiring him for taking up this unusual project.

Yes, that’s 4 genres in one sentence. And that’s not counting the many “Public Service Announcements” within those social messages. A bit much that alas adds to not much. ","Nanu Ki Jaanu reminds you of all the films that are worse than it. So, through the film you are going, “oh well, at least they didn’t do this”, “thank you filmmakers, for not doing that.” and so on. Yep, not a good reason to like a film, whatever you like of it. So, what do you make of a film that is obviously comedy, intentionally horror-comedy, romantic in the weirdest of ways and spreads social messages across the film? And just in case you are wondering, those messages don’t come with subtlety. They spring at you towards the end, in what could pass off as public service announcements that play at the beginning of films these days. It is ironically appalling that a film which seems to care so much about so many things that are wrong with society, starts off with making light of molestation and rape. While I hope that the film was attempting satire, it didn’t come across as that. In that sense, the writing was also lacking in dialogue and the big reveal wasn’t really a big reveal. It was planted through the film with “whodunnit” questions by one too many characters. Also, the quest begins a little too late in the film – basically at the point where the audience is ready for the film to end. That makes the run-time seem longer, the film stretched. Also that part of the film comes across as an addendum, even an afterthought. The performances are all perfunctory border-lining slapstick on many occasions. From Abhay Deol to Rajesh Sharma to Patralekha, all seem like they are doing their best without having too much hope. Manu Rishi Chadha’s dry humor act gets a couple of laugh out louds. But, that’s about it. This one was a ‘Switch channels if it’s on cable’ that got bumped up to ‘Watch if you have nothing better to do’ because it tries to do something different within its genre of “ghost comedy” but sadly also because I have seen a lot worse.

The product comes across as tacky because of the constant shuffle between comedy, unintentional comedy, a few extra-predictable scenes, and unexpected plot twists.","As a movie buff I would watch this movie just for the creative concept. Unfortunately, however, it does not get support from any of the other departments. Also, it’s a shame that while the overall plot is imaginative, way too many individual scenes are so clichéd that you can say what's going to happen next with your eyes, ears and brains shut. As any thriller should, the movie moves at a remarkably fast pace and before you know it you are watching the interval previews. And thus no time is wasted on character development, detailing or consistency. Also the actors playing these characters don't help the cause. Barring Akshaye Khanna, the rest of the ensemble either drone to make you sleep or shriek to wake you up. And it isn't Akshaye's best performance either. Part of the credit for lousy acting and characterization should also go to the ridiculous dialogues.They seemed to have had a hard time trying to decide whether this should have been a comedy or a suspense thriller. I am willing to take a bet that it would have been a much better product if they had chosen one and just stuck by it. Mixing the two has done irreparable damage to it. Especially since the thrilling twists and turns, very unintentionally, make you laugh and the juvenile comedy makes you grit your teeth in anger. And the back and forth manipulations in the second half become a tad too exhausting for the viewer. The saving grace is that the director of photography, the editor, and the sound designer have shown considerable restraint. Given the locales and the subject of the movie it was very easy to go overboard in these departments.On the other hand, I seem to have run out of ways to complain about Sameer's lyrics. And is it original music by Pritam this time? That could explain why it is worse than mediocre. What I find most amazing about any work of art is the passion with which the artist creates it. In a movie it is more exciting because there are so many passionate people involved. But it is most unfortunate when almost everything

But, Natarang takes the concept a few notches higher. And this can be said about both the lead performance and the story. I very reluctantly confess that all of this happens only in the second half.","The fight between passion and duty translates to a war between individualism and sacrifice of it. Individualism ain't a bad word. When you talk about your rights, you always would like to make decisions that'd make you happy, that keep you close to your passion. But these feelings begin to change when they are for others, especially when you see the other succeeding, and leaving his ""duty"" to rot. But his is the gray character we are and this is the gray character Guna is.I haven't a clue how to describe Atul Kulkarni's performance as Guna, except maybe to say that his depiction of a man going through a huge dilemma is one of the best, I've seen. Spellbinding! It certainly must not have been effortless and doesn't look like it either. In fact, I wonder, if preparing for this role changed him as a personality and a person. All the other performances are completely sidelined, and this time I don't feel too bad for them. The aspiring tamasha performer, Guna (Atul), comes from the lowest rung of poverty and lives in a remote village in Maharashtra. He's shunned by one and all, except for a few fellow will-do-anything-for-a-living friends. This situation creates a dilemma even in the viewer's mind. In such abject circumstances, is it right for Guna to pursue his dream? We, the educated, the open-minded have to remind ourselves that now that the question has come, the answer should be ""Why not?"" And you still struggle. Most of us might not have taken the steps Guna takes, if we were put in his situation. And yet, we know he's doing the right thing. His first service is to himself, ain't it? And this is only the main struggle the main character is going through. There are many issues the side-characters are struggling with. There are smaller issues that the Guna is struggling with. And you are aware of the constant tug-of-war between passion and duty. You also figure the various solutions different kinds of people have sought. There is an extremely valid point Natarang tries to make, which is not related to this tussle at all. That each of us has a masculine and feminine side to ourselves. Unfortunately, this takes the side-track and is never explored in detail. Another day, another film, maybe. For now, it is used to accentuate Guna's predicament. The problem though is that the spot that Guna is in takes the longest time to settle down. Until the interval, you are just a bystander, and don't feel much for Guna. It's only much later that the build-up takes you to a wonderful climax. It's one of those films that completely bowls you over as it progresses. It takes its time to grow on you, but if the feeling is that of satisfaction while walking out of the theater, it's only a minor crime.

But eventually, it’s only him trying to fill the lacunae for every inferiority.","One of the many reasons I still adore V.V. Shirwadkar’s classic play Natsamrat is the manner in which multi-layered narrative unfolds. It comes with its own limitations, has situational flaws and is draped in a setting totally ‘done to death’ to our contemporary senses. While it is written as elaborately as is possible, it gives only essential details away. Nothing much, but nothing less – an ideal storytelling scenario, isn’t it? This draws you in, makes you think, intensifies your train of thoughts – the very principle Natsamrat’s screen adaptation fails to carry forward. However, like the original stageplay It does succeed with some high-octane words. The question, however, remains – how long can this wordplay help sustain your interest in the absence of narrative novelty? Though written and adapted terrifically, words instead serve as the ultimate weapon for Nana Patekar. He, in turn, outperforms all that could be asked of him. No wonder the importance shifts to his Ganpatrao Belwalkar, while the rest is left unattended. And that’s a shame.Cinema and stage both have much in common, yet they’re poles apart. Mahesh Manjrekar’s film version has that kind of mature understanding. It seems like he gets the constraints posed by Ganpatrao’s illustrious monologues. So, freshly-drafted characters and settings step in, to back these monologues in a cinematic environment. Since the original plot about self-centred children turning against their parents is nothing but outdated, a new framework accommodates the same, worn-out plot. Now that they have made so many changes, I am bewildered that they couldn’t get rid of material that lost its essence a long time back. It’s good that Manjrekar and co. don’t cut-paste things, but additions are as good as nothing if they’re not worthwhile.The play opens with Ganpatrao’s monologue as he bids adieu to the stage forever. It seems an ideal world until the flashback-esque moment suddenly returns to his present, worrying state. It shows the epitome of conflicts; and you take that for granted without even seeing its origins. It works for the play. The film takes a different approach though. Starting off with a climactic plot, it strolls through his memory lanes non-linearly. Due to a new structural design, the film has to recreate conflicts from scratch. But instead of a set of events establishing a clear-cut disagreement, one or more moments come together as silly. What is even sillier is that you’re made to swallow everything blindly. The film embarks on such a promising note that it saddens me seeing it falter soon after. With no appropriate character graph, except for your principal man, what else can you even expect? That means, appreciate whatever Nana brings forth, because it is perhaps a dream role; but don’t rant about the rest. In other words, Nana means the film and the film means Nana; rest isn’t even to be considered for your thoughtful engagement.Rarely does dialogue stay as faithful to its respective characters as is in Natsamrat. Not just because they’re out-and-out peculiar and figurative at the same time, but more because they’re far more reliable than the script is. While a few adaptations only borrow original framework, a few bluntly imitate all they can. Natsamrat does both. Even though its newer structure is pretty much broken, a clever arranging and editing of original dialogue is my takeaway from the film. If you’ve seen or read the play, you’ll know a certain piece of a dialogue, monologue or verse is utilised in a completely different set-up altogether. That said, the scripting and staging is so appalling that this works at a point and doesn’t at another. I loved the effort nonetheless.Natsamrat also falls short of dealing with melodrama. What works best for the play doesn’t necessarily suit the film. Ganpatrao being a hysterical man pulls that feat off with great coolness and composure. But you don’t really empathise with the state he is forced to live in. There are no feelings attached. What’s the use of words or performances minus emotional connect? Actors do here what is written for them, which doesn’t mean what is written is good enough and so do the performances – exception is for Nana, of course. However, Ganpatrao Belwalkar or anybody else can’t become a Natsamrat by themselves. Words, as this character rightfully pays ode to, are the unsung heroes beneath their skins. They can destroy them. They can help climb to glory as well.

Rest of it, though, is pretty much slapstick & far away from believable","Nau Mahine Nau Divas can easily be slotted in the category of mindless comedy stringed together with a plot. Some of the gags and the timing with which they are delivered bring uncontrollable laughter. The flip side is that it is brutally loud throughout and gets into slapstick mode way too often for my taste. Other than the comic tone maintained through the film, there's nothing much happening in the film story-wise. The entire film is sort-of a chase sequence. A basic lie is told. When it risks being discovered buffoonery covers it up with of course another lie. The cumulative lies are at the verge of being discovered. And the cycle repeats till the climax where the most unbelievable aspect of human behavior is explored. Despite the sexual references and all the trying-to-get-pregnant related jokes, the film treats its women with a lot of respect. They are strong, influential albeit one-dimensional characters. But the one-dimensionality again is not reserved for the women. The entire film focuses hard on making you laugh hard, character development isn't even remotely on its agenda. Anyway, it ain't fair to complain about proximity to reality when that is clearly kept at a distance while writing the film. Let's just say I cannot like films like these in entirety but I thoroughly enjoy some of the episodes. There are spurts of hilarious scenes in between overbearing, over-the-top dramatics. There are also a couple of scenes which are really funny only that the punch line comes a second of two late and thus you end-up laughing before the joke comes about. But, at least you laughed, right? There's this one sequence where Deshmukh tai and her son are sort-of playing Charades to communicate with each other. The perfect synch with which the characters were interacting shows the amount of time spent on rehearsals. In general, the comic timing of the women in the film was pretty out of the ordinary. At the risk of stereotyping I must say there aren't too many women who can do comedy well and the women in nau mahine nau divas have managed that. But good scenes are few and far between. And there are just way too many ridiculous loopholes that make the film look silly rather than funny.

Makes you want to believe that lovely performances by two lead characters, witty dialogue and a philosophical concept delivered with humor would be enough to make a film rise above the ordinary. Unfortunately it is matched by plastic/caricaturish performances by the rest of the cast, some slapsticky humor and a run down south towards a typical climax. ","Ram vs. Raavan is a simple enough good vs. evil fight. Unless the struggle is between the Ram and Raavan in you. Nautanki Saala has this very intriguing conflict set at its heart - the one within. Remarkably enough, it also manages, to a great extent, to keep things light with quippy dialogue. Unfortunately though, it slacks off more often than not, the story loses its way and that kind of intrigue exists only in one of the characters. The plot starts out with a man of today called Ram (Ayushman Khurana), who is too good to be true, saving a stranger's life. Interestingly enough he plays Raavan in a stage show that he directs too. The quirky treatment to an outlandish start gives the film a dream-like ambiance. But it is pretty amazing how the atmosphere created doesn't let the implausibility of it all bother you. However, that lasts only for the first hour or so.The turn of events in the second half take Nautanki Saala into the regular girl-boy zone. Except for glimpses of the protagonist's struggle with himself, the situations become pretty ordinary. Not to mention, other than Ram and Mandar (Kunal Roy Kapoor), the other characters are lame from the outset. Especially the women. While Chitra (Gaelyn Mendonca) is refreshingly understanding her maturity isn't consistent. The other lady, Nandini (Pooja Salvi) is dumb and dumber both. That more than one man would fall in love with her, is extremely unconvincing. Also, neither Chitra nor Pooja are helped by the performances. Both Gaelyn and Pooja are plastic dolls given trendy styles to wear. The men however, do a magnificent job of keeping you engaged with their performances. Kunal Roy Kapoor's Mandar is eternally depressed and yet, quirkily funny evoking the side in you that enjoys dark humor. A few characters break into a regional language which seems both unnatural as a part of the film and is superficially delivered by the actors. Ayushman Khurana wins you over once again with a charming performance. He plays both Ram and the part of him trying to keep his internal Raavan at bay, with equal conviction. All this while making it look natural and effortless. Expect to be blown over by the way he kisses his girl - one of the most natural, comfortable and convincing on-screen kisses I have seen in Hindi cinema. It's pretty much these two and the witty dialogue that keeps you going for the 2+ hours of the film. It slows down considerably, picking pace very unevenly, and once in a longish while. The quirks are enjoyable, but there is enough slapstick humor, in the form of sexual and toilet humor and the usual slapping around and falling people, attempting to make you laugh. The ambiance created by the colors, lighting and music too is very slick and helps to keep the dragging parts alive.Yet, with the given premise, it's sad that the narrative didn't take itself beyond the obvious Ramayan references. The hat tip towards how each one of us wears a mask and churns out a life full of drama for ourselves is subtle and enjoyable. But, that it all boils down to a very ordinary romance takes all that away from Nautanki Saala!

149,849,849,849,849,Nebraska,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/nebraska-review/,,5/5.0,,3.4,"An aching reminder of how the little things in life matter so much, Alexander Payne's Academy Award-nominated Nebraska is a gently humorous and stirringly simple journey, anchored by at least two terrific performances.","Time is strange, that way. It waits for no one, but it also always catches up with you. When it does, you're usually left rueing the past or dreading the future. In Alexander Payne's unhurried, warm Nebraska, an old man with a shaky past, a bleak future and questionable mental abilities has his heart set on a wild goose chase - a supposed windfall that he's sure of - which will take him from Montana to Nebraska. Stubborn and unrelenting as he is, one of his two sons decides to humour him and take him along, because he just doesn't know how long his father will live anyway.There is such joy in seeing a filmmaker who knows his characters and their stories so well, that he sees no need to push things and make them happen. Nebraska is funny, slow, gentle and moving. It explores so many different kinds of relationships in a family, as well in the extended family.The most endearing among them is that of father and son. David, the son, has personal problems as well, but he puts it all on the side to concentrate on his father. The father, a brash, near-senile old fellow with a drinking problem, doesn't give much to make you like him. Yet, the sight of his son doing so much for his father never once strikes a false note; because you can see that on some level he's terrified at the thought of his own old age, when it sets upon him.Also, since the film is largely set in a small town called Hawthorne in Nebraska, it also has some genuinely insightful moments that show how a sleepy, close-knit town is almost like one gigantic joint family, unlike in large cities where you're alone even if you're in a crowd. Shot in gorgeous black-and-white and with a folksy soundtrack as company, the film exudes a charm that harks back to the days of old.Like in his previous film The Descendants, Alexander Payne seems to have this wonderful quality of creating memorable scenes in the unlikeliest of settings. In Nebraska, watch out for a few of them set in places you'd least expect - a cemetary, for example.Veteran actor Bruce Dern, in his Oscar-nominated turn as the father Woody in Nebraska, is quite terrific. He has to alternately display spurts of comprehension with stretches of being lost, and he does it so convincingly. He also almost always has you interested in the reason he wants to visit Nebraska in the first place, despite everyone close to him telling him that he's off his rocker. However, despite Bruce Dern walking away with nominations and accolades for this one, the film is actually shouldered almost entirely by Will Forte, who plays David. The film is essentially David's story; the graph, the growth, the resolution, they're all his. Reminiscent, strangely, of a young Quentin Tarantino, Forte's straight face as he tackles some complex scenes may have been the reason why it may appear that he hasn't put in as much as Dern, but fact is that Forte holds the film together. His is a severely underrated performance. As the journey of the film unspools itself gently, you find yourself not knowing whether to smile or feel sorry for Woody and David. Eventually, though, despite the note the film ends on sticking out a wee bit from the rest of the film, the unsaid feelings of love and respect they have for each other hit home. You're left feeling that, for all of us, there is still hope.

It isn't a surprise then that it is not fiction, not something created by someone through their imagination. In fact, the story is what it is because it is true. It is heartening because such humanity is not 'just in the movies'. Would Neerja, the film have the same impact if the story weren't true? Difficult to say. However, the story would certainly have been forgotten by many if it weren't for the film. And, of course, the story could have been forgettable, if it wasn't told this well. It has been a long time since I heard applause by audience after the film ended and it has been a long time since I had tears well up and roll away because of a performance. Every time Shabana Azmi is on screen, I sensed a flood of emotion  that I haven't felt in a movie in ages. Her voice inflections through the film, not only in one particular scene, touch a chord. Not just her, you empathize with Yogendra Tiku as her husband, Neerja's father every time he is speechless  but is required to form words. And of course, Sonam Kapoor has vowed with keeping it restrained and real. A word here for the actors who play the terrorists, though I feel that even acknowledging the terrrorists' existence is giving them too much. Well, then that is how well the actors have done. Shekhar Ravjiani – even before we watched the film, we knew that we have to see this man in bigger roles on screen, didn't we? One could complain that the film could have been shorter making it crisper because after all it is almost two hours of being stuck in a plane. However, I would stop myself short while doing that, because it is about hijacked people who were stuck with terrorists in a plane for 16-17 hours. Remember we got breaks in the form of flashbacks. Other than that, sure, there is drama in the form of tight close-ups and use hand-held cameras. But it is not overdone. Maybe the Rajesh Khanna bit is a little over-the-top, here's hoping that Neerja Bhanot was really that big a fan. Aside from telling a story about the events of PAN AM 73, Neerja has a lovely layer of  woman empowerment sewed into the fabric of the film. This is not just about the woman's grit because she is a woman. But also about being wanted as a girl child, about her independent spirit and about her having to stand-up against labels and what was wrong. Not because she is a woman, but because she is human. And that is what is so enabling about the film's subtext. Indeed, you feel like standing up to salute her parents who instilled the values that she lived and died by. Goodness forbid then, were we to find ourselves in a situation like this, will be remember this film and act accordingly? Even if a handful of us do and fewer stay as brave, we would have made Neerja's short life larger.

151,851,851,851,851,New Year's Eve,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review1 Reader Review 0/5.0,/movie/new-years-eve-review/,,0/5.0,,4.8,"There’s a scene in the film where a gynecologist removes DVDs of Valentine’s Day (Another film by director Gary Marshall) the movie, from her patient’s um, lower parts, as to comically pretend it’s a baby. Really? That’s your idea of a Romantic Comedy? Oh and yes, this line is exactly what will be going through your mind through the film. So a film named New Year’s Eve, from a guy who directed an anti-rom com that turned into a rom com called Valentine’s Day, is also about the pressure of New Year’s Eve day. Except, the film propagates hope, love and fresh beginnings. No surprise there. ","Okay, I’m going to try and come up with a cooler idiom for ‘Too many cooks spoil the broth’. Let’s see. How about, too many celebrities (actors) can turn a “movie” into a greeting card. Yep, that’s pretty much New Year’s Eve for you – Every recollect-able, sellable face that you can imagine, thrown into a clichéd, predictable movie about the commercial and consumerist idea of New Year’s Eve. New Year’s Eve is a movie about various characters and their separate experiences with New Year’s Eve day. You have Ashton Kutcher and Lea Michelle (of Glee fame) who get stuck in an elevator. Kutcher’s anti-New Year’s eve feelings gets converted when Michelle, who’s a backup singer makes him realize how everyone has their hopes pinned on one day to start over fresh.Robert DeNiro is dying, and his last wish is to watch the ball-drop (a Times Square tradition) this eve. But the hospital’s policy doesn’t allow him to move from his bed. Michelle Pfeiffer is stuck in a dull, thankless job, when with the help of Zac Efron, she spends a day fulfilling all her desires. Katherine Heigl meets Jon Bon Jovi at a dinner that she is catering for, as he’s performing as Rockstar Jensen. They struggle to keep their past feelings at bay. Sarah Jessica Parker plays protective mother to Abigail Breslin (of Little Miss Sunshine fame) but they resolve their issues to let love and hope overcome everything. It is followed by that “uplifting” background music that is meant to make you abandon all your cynicism. You know, peppy pianos, a litte hip-hop and ofcourse, they HAD to end the film with ‘What a Wonderful World’.I think the biggest issue with New Year’s Eve is the screenwriter’s (Katherine Fugate) inability to connect with the characters. Having multiple mini-stories works only when you can slowly unfold each, and let the viewers live the stories. The makers are so obsessed, with packaging a commercial commodity, and putting in everything remotely sellable (Zac Efron for instance, after his High School musical fame), I’m surprised the Twilight cast isn’t involved in the film.New Year’s Eve has some light moments though. Pfeiffer is adorable as a reserved middle-aged woman who gets genuine joy from doing things she never imagined. Halle Berry is hot as always, and she’s the one person in the whole film who doesn’t overact. It’s sort of tiring to place almost every light-hearted film that “Hollywood” churns out, into the kind of movie you’d want to breeze through while flipping channels. New Year’s Eve is a clichéd film that wants to believe it has perfected the formula of making money at the box office. Sigh, just watch Love Actually if you’re in the mood for hope, love and more such holiday positivity.

But, it is padded with fluff that is typical of Hindi cinema - songs, colors & happy faces. And this fluff is more in the narration rather than the basic plot itself. That with the predictable dialogues and turn of events makes this a little less watchable than it could have been. All set right in the second half though.","A man is found stealing a mango.
Situation 1: He's chased and beaten to pulp and thrown into jail. 
Situation 2: The chasers realize that he's not eaten anything in 5 days and that's why he's stealing. You beat him on the way to jail. 
Situation 3: The chasers realize that he was stealing it for his children and wife. They haven't eaten in 5 days. You give him a warning and let him go. 
Situation 4: The chasers realize that he is stealing for his family because he has been duped by a loan-shark. You might actually go with him to beat up the loanshark. Suppose the mango was not stolen. But it was a couple of buildings in downtown Manhattan that he conspired to blow up and did so successfully. Not pardonable, right? Even if it is similar to situation 4. But, of course.Suppose he was not he, he was you? Now, what do you do? This is the debate New York struggles with. It doesn't offer solutions or show one right path - that is the script's beauty. For, there ain't a straightforward answer to this dilemma. Yeah, there's loads of stereotyping - whites are painted the darkest hue of black. What if the whites were not the whites, they were you? After all the insanity and inhumanity of racial profiling is prevalent just about everywhere. That's exactly what the security guards at every building gate are doing. That's exactly what the barricades in the middle of city roads are for.All good, message nice. Arguments on both sides convincing thus engaging. But, and here's the biggest BUT of all...why over-dramatize it? It's Aditya Chopra, so we know there's going to be drama. The 'over' is overtly annoying and doesn't provide much relief until the interval. It actually reminded of the days of VCRs when my mom would forward through half a Hindi film. The background music is too on-the-ear except for a place or two where it's really well done. The close-ups are beautiful but at places which need ruggedness not beauty. The slo-mo's are arrrrrgggh!...yep...frustratingly irritating. Disturbing the flow, distracting from the plot and all that jazz! And this happens all the time, not just at key plot points. The one much talked about intense scene is completely spoilt by the camera gimmickry. Whatever catches the director's or producer's fancy, found place in the film, thus making it a much longer film than necessary. It didn't look like a Kabir Khan film at all. Did the producer do as much directing as producing? Thankfully the producer, who's also the writer, also did a fair job of writing the overall plot. And this in comparison to reasonably well-received films like Black Friday and Fanaa, both of which had similar elements. And both of which I didn't really like. The point is the struggle and the frustration of the people who are discriminated against. And that is made well enough for us to be curious about what's up next, despite the gaps. What scheme? What plan? Why is such a small gang under FBI's radar? The writer couldn't be bothered with those details. And when some of the more minute details are given you wish they weren't because you could've predicted them 30 seconds ago. There surely must be other ways to create suspense than to give it extra brooding time and kill it. Same goes for the (lack of) punch in the one-liners. But most of this is restricted to the first half. The second half becomes heavy and gripping. Inspite of the glaring NO-NOs, there's quite a bit to cherish. The performances were brilliant. Now who would've thought this space would have said that about Katrina Kaif and John Abraham? Okay it's only relative, they are brilliant compared to their earlier non-performances. Katrina Kaif, as expected from an Aditya Chopra story, has a strong role in support. She not only looks her usual pretty self, but this time around, she makes you feel for her and her accent doesn't bother as much. John Abraham can actually convey his character's emotions if he's shown how and New York shows how. It's unfair that not much can be said about actors like Irrfan Khan other than ""his usual best"". The penalty one has to pay for being talented. Neil Nitin Mukesh is good but looks like he's capable of much more, just needs to find more variety.So, what is it that can't keep the bling out of a YR film? When will the constant, visible struggle between supposed ""mass pleasing"" and need and mood of the story get over? They are edging to make films that make a difference. They have made some moves in this film that won't be very popular. Then why not go the whole 9 yards? Or are they taking one baby step at a time...pushing the envelope? I hope so.

153,853,853,853,853,Newton,Owner's Pride!,wogma reviewPreview21 Critic Reviews 4.6/5.0 6 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/newton-review/,4.6/5.0,5/5.0,,4.866666667,You brace yourself for the highest degrees of scathing cynicism when you walk in to a film about India's election process. You walk out with a smile that balances the skepticism with healthy hopefulness. Those are just a few “when was the last time that happened” packed in 100+ minutes.,"Nothing that happens in Newton is really surprising. We know, more or less, how things work. The beauty is that you realise what you already know, as it unfolds in the film. This detailed unrevealing is what makes Newton a unique experience. This isn't an experience that glorifies the natural beauty of the forests of central India with its camera-work. There are no slickly designed action sequences that make it a must watch in the theater. It is the writing, the narration and the performances that make me want to watch it again. Of course, the film is pleasant to the eye and the action is real. But, the real hook is the sinking feeling that you are fighting. You know things are going to only get worse and ironically, you want to stay optimistic. And you are smiling through it all.The conspicuous absence of satire is very satisfying. The humor comes from the situations and the everyday cynicism that fits in exactly at the place it is found at, in real life. Also, rarely does a film that takes on so many facets of life, does justice to all of them. A running theme through the film is the struggle between idealism and reality. This struggle is multiplied as our indignant, honest protagonist, Newton (Rajkummar Rao) meets the outright corrupt who patronize and humor him, till they realise they have to concede. You know why this latter group has a smirk on, as they watch Newton's realisation of the many-layered challenges in getting tribals to cast their vote in an election - villagers who live in abject poverty and are caught between the devil and the deep sea. Even after a few hours of having left the theater, I am in awe at the arm's distance the film maintains from taking a skeptical route. At times, it is indeed difficult to not scoff at Newton's borderline anal, righteousness. Yet, you are concerned for him when he calls out pseudo-nationalism even though it is a well-placed joke. You want to talk practical sense into him as he takes on the entitlement that the army-men feel. Just imagine, frail and meek Rajkummar Rao taking on Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men. Yes, that scary. Because here, Atmaram (Pankaj Tripathi), the officer in charge of guarding the election officer's team could beat our protagonist brutally with good support from the rest of the characters. What's scarier is that the former might have support from a few in the audience too. It is no mean feat, to get an audience invested in as uni-dimensional a character as Newton. You are that involved. That too when half the film is about a few men and one woman waiting for voters to show up. This part makes for a good chunk of this crisp, 100+ minute film and yet it doesn't feel like the pace has slackened. The only place that film feels like it's slipping is towards the end - an act of desperation that is uncharacteristic of the film so far. Fortunately, it recovers with one of the best climaxes I have seen in Hindi films. There is also a song that might seem out of place. While watching it though, it felt like an intentional move to highlight the farcical proceedings of the election process.

What can one can say when every single actor is perfectly cast? It would be newsworthy only if Rajkummar Rao or Pankaj Tripathi failed us with their act.

The bravado needed, to approach the topic or its details, to take a gentle stab at misplaced national pride, is obvious. But, it also isn't easy to write a story around the election process on election day and not make it cynically preachy, a civics lesson or documentary-like. That is like dodging three bullets coming at you. To survive the temptations and tell a story of a relatively uni-dimensional protagonist, in a crisp, immersive film is challenging, to say the least. I feel the need to visit this film again and have my kids watch it too – because this is a once in the blue moon film, the details of which, cannot be digested in one viewing.

154,854,854,854,854,Nil Battey Sannata,Not rated by wogma,Preview19 Critic Reviews 4.6/5.0 2 Reader Reviews 5/5.0 34 Tweet Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/newton-review/,4.6/5.0,5/5.0,5/5.0,4.866666667,You brace yourself for the highest degrees of scathing cynicism when you walk in to a film about India's election process. You walk out with a smile that balances the skepticism with healthy hopefulness. Those are just a few “when was the last time that happened” packed in 100+ minutes.,"Nothing that happens in Newton is really surprising. We know, more or less, how things work. The beauty is that you realise what you already know, as it unfolds in the film. This detailed unrevealing is what makes Newton a unique experience. This isn't an experience that glorifies the natural beauty of the forests of central India with its camera-work. There are no slickly designed action sequences that make it a must watch in the theater. It is the writing, the narration and the performances that make me want to watch it again. Of course, the film is pleasant to the eye and the action is real. But, the real hook is the sinking feeling that you are fighting. You know things are going to only get worse and ironically, you want to stay optimistic. And you are smiling through it all.The conspicuous absence of satire is very satisfying. The humor comes from the situations and the everyday cynicism that fits in exactly at the place it is found at, in real life. Also, rarely does a film that takes on so many facets of life, does justice to all of them. A running theme through the film is the struggle between idealism and reality. This struggle is multiplied as our indignant, honest protagonist, Newton (Rajkummar Rao) meets the outright corrupt who patronize and humor him, till they realise they have to concede. You know why this latter group has a smirk on, as they watch Newton's realisation of the many-layered challenges in getting tribals to cast their vote in an election - villagers who live in abject poverty and are caught between the devil and the deep sea. Even after a few hours of having left the theater, I am in awe at the arm's distance the film maintains from taking a skeptical route. At times, it is indeed difficult to not scoff at Newton's borderline anal, righteousness. Yet, you are concerned for him when he calls out pseudo-nationalism even though it is a well-placed joke. You want to talk practical sense into him as he takes on the entitlement that the army-men feel. Just imagine, frail and meek Rajkummar Rao taking on Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men. Yes, that scary. Because here, Atmaram (Pankaj Tripathi), the officer in charge of guarding the election officer's team could beat our protagonist brutally with good support from the rest of the characters. What's scarier is that the former might have support from a few in the audience too. It is no mean feat, to get an audience invested in as uni-dimensional a character as Newton. You are that involved. That too when half the film is about a few men and one woman waiting for voters to show up. This part makes for a good chunk of this crisp, 100+ minute film and yet it doesn't feel like the pace has slackened.

155,855,855,855,855,Nine,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review,/movie/nine-review/,,,,4.866666667,Nine is about an Italian filmmaker (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) facing midlife crisis and about to launch an ambitious film without having had a single word written on paper or in his head. The undoing of this musical is its lack of engaging music and energy.,"Somewhere in the first half of Nine, a journalist sarcastically tells film director Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis) that no one knew what his last film was about. As it turns out the sharp barb holds true for the film itself.At a very basic level, Nine is a musical about an Italian director Guido Contini who has ‘run out of things to say’. Suffering from midlife crisis, Contini has not written a single word for his forthcoming film Italia for which he is about to start shooting in the next ten days. Through a series of songs and dances, we are introduced to the various women in his life and the depths of his frustration and are posed with the question of whether he will get over his block.The hitch is not so much the simplistic plot -- that is a given in most musicals -- but rather the lack of engaging music and energy that undoes it.Now Nine is a film that is adapted from an award-winning Broadway musical, which itself draws from Federico Fellini's film 8½. I haven’t watched the production or Fellini’s movie. But I do have some idea of what an entertaining film could be. And Nine is not really that film.What Nine does however is it brings together some of the biggest Hollywood actresses across generations together. There is Sophia Loren who plays Contini’s mother and appears in his imagination from time to time; Marion Cotillard who plays Luisa his wife; Judi Dench who is his costume designer and confidant; Fergie who plays a prostitute; Penelope Cruz who is his mistress; Kate Hudson an American fashion journalist and Nicole Kidman, his muse whose onscreen appearance may not be longer than nine minutes.Despite the presence of so many women or perhaps because of it, Nine tends to drift away in to particular direction. You know that these are the women who have touched Contini’s life in some defining way but it doesn’t necessarily come through.Dench of course belts out a fascinating performance -- she even has a song picturised on her -- as does Cotillard. But the performances of these women and that of Daniel Day-Lewis do little to save the faltering and predictable film. Nine comes from Rob Marshall who directed another musical, the immensely brilliant, Chicago. For some reason he is unable to repeat the magic in this one. Surely, Nine is no masterpiece and certainly not worth going bonkers about. If at all there are some breathtaking shots of Italy in the movie. But then again you could well find them on Google.

Great performances (like that’s a surprise!), straight-forward dialogues and a bold storyline make the movie worth watching. But does not necessarily warrant a trip to the theaters. It would have been better if they spent a little time on relationships other than the Amitabh Bachchan-Jiah Khan relationship. Also the overenthusiastic cameraman and murder-mystery style background music got exasperating after a while.","Your personality determines your taste. Now, that is a pretty obvious statement! I consider myself liberal, but the concept of a father falling in love with his daughter’s friend just crosses a line that does not jell with my personality. Yeah-yeah, older people do fall in love with much younger people, and falling in love is natural. I understand all of that. But, reading about Nishabd gave me the feeling you get when you think of long nails screeching on a blackboard. Going in struggling to rid myself of that feeling, trying hard not to judge a book by its cover, and coming out with the thought, “so, what is love, after all?” – means the movie worked. It touched some chord somewhere, especially considering my attitude towards the subject. Ram Gopal Varma played his first card right. He cast the only person who could pull this off (commercially) in Hindi cinema. On your way out you really feel bad for Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) even though he doesn’t fit into your moral boundaries. Vijay’s character is the most fleshed out and mostly consistent. The grim lighting in his monologue as narrator worked to show that he was a human who had resigned to his dark side. May be to the disappointment of many, the thing that works the best is the very conspicuous absence of lust. The ‘lollipop’ and Jiah Khan’s ‘finger in the mouth’ in the promos are very misleading. There are no fireworks here. And that is the charm. Jiah might not be beauty personified but has screen presence and grabs your attention. And that is not just because she is skimpily clad. In a couple of scenes, just by one movement on her face, you knew what mood she was in. The dialogues are crisp and keep you interested throughout. The characters are left nishabd or at the most ek-shabd when there is no need for dialogues. However, on the whole the movie lacks depth. In tastefully handling the main relationship, the other relationships were ignored. The makers took the easy route. To highlight the intensity of the Vijay-Jiah relationship, they abandoned explanations for all other relationships.My other rather huge complaint is against the background music and the cameraman. What was with the suspense-thriller type of music and camera work? The aerial shots of the tea estates were well-shot, but most of the close-ups and the dancing of the camera from one angle to other were very annoying. So, is it okay now for a father to encourage a romantic relationship with his daughter’s friend? No certainly not, not even if it is Amitabh Bachchan! But, it is a story told well through its dialogues and performances. Why not a higher rating then? Because it felt incomplete.

And while I'm at it yes slapstick, yes loud, yes tiring, non-stop nonsense. What? Who? Why? How? No questions are important enough to be addressed let alone answered.","In the midst of pure chaos, there is a man with a purpose who wants to commit suicide. He has a point to make. And he makes it too. The only problem is the audience is mere human. It is impossible for us to ignore the ado and pay attention to his meek voice. I didn't go about looking for logic, I know the genre and I know my dislike against it. I try to balance it out by telling myself, ""enjoy it for what it is."" But, how do you enjoy a slapstick that doesn't make you smile even once? How do you let your hair loose when you are trying you best to keep your hands away from tearing them apart? How do you get yourself interested in the acting versus background score competition for loudness? I'm told these are the things that define the genre. But to me, it looks like a last ditch effort by all involved to milk whatever star-power they have in their waning years. And that's a shame because no one from the cast - from Anil Kapoor to Neetu Chandra need to do this. They surely have better things to do. Or at the very least, each one of them surely has a better way of making a fool of themselves. Geez, Sushmita Sen goes all double personality and screechy on you for goodness sake! I'm told that you are supposed to laugh at the silliness. I would have if it were really that silly. Every time something super-silly happens on screen there is an attempt to justify it and give it some credibility. The struggle between logic and ludicrous is won by inane with a headache thrown in as an extra. A quick example - everyone is South Africa, yes including locals, understands and speaks Hindi. And just when you are preparing your snide remark about it a character says to the other, ""He hasn't learnt English, but he has taught everyone in his village to speak Hindi!"" Why bother? You are right. Why do I even bother.Every once in a while there is a movie for which I just feel like writing a one-liner asking you to not watch the movie and finish it off. This was one of them. But I impose upon myself the duty to explain why I want to keep you away from the film. I feel responsible. Now only if the film-makers felt a fraction as responsible.

The visualization then is just a starting point for the audience's imagination. My suggestion - don’t look for a linear description of events, look for how this idea, this concept takes shape.","A four-letter expletive repeated thrice is what I am left with. In an excited tone. In an ""I don't believe I just saw that in Hindi"" tone. And most fascinatingly in an ""It is beyond me to completely comprehend what I saw in one take"" tone. The beauty of abstract concepts is that there are almost as many meanings as there are viewers. What a paradox!? Something that is not obviously meaningful has many more meanings than a clear statement! Oh, did I just digress?Coming to the point - the movie was a treat for the senses. The background music, sound design, camerawork, special effects - all worked towards narrating the idea. Nope, I cannot make myself say I saw a story; it was a visual description of an idea - a 'what if...?' Such cinema might not be the proverbial ""everyone's cup of tea"". But, the point is, it is now available for those who enjoy a different flavor. Thank you, Mr. Director!John Abraham plays K and absolutely everything in the movie is from K's point of view. But, don't let that keep you away, even if you are wary of his acting skills. Because he is literally 'unbelievably' good. The transition from the self-obsessed, full-of-himself man to the person who has lost his grip was remarkable. Especially because this came through to us with his performance and not merely the lines given to him. However, we could have certainly survived without the animated thought bubbles. What exactly was their purpose? They were not funny, not insightful - especially since you could make out what John was thinking from his body language and movement of facial muscles (yes believe me, he can actually do that!).It was a joy to watch Paresh Rawal not making a fool of himself. But his performance lacked a punch that the character demanded. A more powerful, more menacing ""Sri Sri Sri ... baba"" would have been great.The dialogues are nice and crisp, and absent when not needed - leaving a lot of room for interpretation. At the very least a couple of metaphors to decipher. Especially, the commentary on the infinite self-improvement programmes resorted to these days. Do any of the umpteen movie awards given out have a bravery award? I guess not. I think the time has come to start one and the first one should go to 'No smoking'  Not just for the technical brilliance, but for the concept itself. Sadly, though, it might not go down as well with too many people. And those who are exposed to world cinema, have seen similar stuff before. But, what I admire is that I was able to watch it in a theater that screens mainstream Hindi movies and there were people who applauded when the credits started rolling.The question that I am still struggling with is - Would I have liked it as much if there were more obscure ideas translating into movies? Well, I'd say bring me more and we'll know!

Adam and Emma decide to get into a relationship with ‘no strings attached’, which means they won’t bind themselves to the general code of conduct which goes along with a relationship. While the casualness of such an association is postulate, there always comes a time when one of them gives in to love.","No Strings Attached is an expression for a casual relationship between Adam and Emma with some established ground rules – no attachments, no jealously, no lying, no flowers. Life is fun until they start to actually enjoy time with each other. It answers the 'not so mind-blowing question' – can they stay without falling in love?The characters have been played very well, both by Ashton Kutcher (Adam) and Natalie Portman (Emma). I thought Portman was a very serious actor. But she pulls off a girl next door role (and a tough one at that) in this film very well. After seeing her play something so intense, something so critical in Black Swan, it is a pleasant surprise to see her play a part so simple and regular where she smiles to the fullest and dreams like any other girl. Emma is busy pursuing a medical career and wants to live a life without any liabilities. She doesn’t want to get into a relationship that demands too much time or emotional energy. In a couple of places, though, she blew the emotion off completely. But given her acting capabilities, I'll blame the direction for it. Kutcher, on the other hand, is the same that he was in almost all his romantic films. I absolutely love his part as Kelso (That 70’s Show rocks, man!), and therefore it feels unnatural to see Kutcher act so normal. He somehow flows really well into a handsome guy, who is charming, with a good sense of humor, who lives life to the fullest, and doesn’t expect much from anybody. These guys get together, and obviously… life happens. The story goes from fast and unsurprising in the first half to slow and unsurprising in the second, and yet isn’t all that boring. . The film lies somewhere between a chick flick and a rom-com. Though the dialogues are funny, many of them are in the trailer. Of course, it is predictable to the last dialogue, but there is always the chance that you notice things other than the story. For example the architecture of Adam’s house, the beautiful dress that Portman wears for her date, the funny period mix that Adam makes for Emma. All the supporting characters did fairly convincible jobs and deserve praise too. I especially liked Lake Bell, who plays Adam’s colleague, strong by herself but still almost in love with him. No Strings Attached is sweet and affectionate, but not a must watch. 
Oh and the last bit which goes without saying – lots of suggestive romance scenes, so avoid watching with family.

Not everything might come to culmination as easily as is shown in the second half of No One Killed Jessica. But the film gives us, what we need most - the strength to fight our fights and the hope that we will get what we deserved all along - justice.","Whatever you can expect from a film with - an attention grabbing promo; based on a newspaper story that is close to home for one and all of us; directed by the person who made a strong statement with his debut, Aamir; AND aspires to be a commercial success - is delivered.  It's entertaining, it makes its point and it reaches out to us. Then, even if the film simplifies the struggle that the common man has to go through to get his basic right, it feels like it is only so that we keep our hopes strong in this age of a scam a day. Of course, the state of affairs we live in is disturbing beyond measure. So much so that, we applaud something that should be taken for granted - honest bureaucrats, police, and politicians. As the 'aitbaar' song in the film goes - trust is melting away. Thankfully, there are cases like these to restore that faith to however small an extent. And thankfully, there are people in the film industry who can and are willing to make such films to serve as reminders. They also have selected a brilliant team, which brings to screen situations the way that we might have visualized them when we read the newspapers. And more. The story has a good measure of details that are not necessarily known to people who haven't keenly followed the case. The narrative is also kept interesting with the non-linear references to Sabrina's relationship with her sister. The performances only add to what already is an interesting setup. You love the bitch in Mira (Rani Mukherjee) and the cow in Sabrina (Vidya Balan). You get into their story more because of the bit roles played by a reasonably well-staffed supporting cast. The earnest but dumb, junior journalist Aditi (Maanvi Gagroo) is funny because of the situation she is put in. I loved the way Aditi's side-story subtly shows how Mira makes up to her. The submissive, clueless, simple middle class man, Sanjit Lal (Yogendra Tikku) makes you feel the frustration his daughter Sabrina might have gone through. The powerful politician's side-kick is only too proud to ""take care"" of the witnesses and evidence. And the most impressive was the actor who played inspector (name, anyone?). His role in the case is such a huge finger pointed at the country's administration. I could've have done with a little less dramatization, for example entry of the key witness into the courtroom. But, I'd much rather see a commercial success for films like these than cater to my preferences. Isn't it commendable, that a film about such a serious issue leaves you in good humor, without taking away anything from the message. A lot of it has to do with the witty dialogue and amusing (or made amusing) situations. Another huge chunk of credit goes to Amit Trivedi (oh, how I have restrained myself from saying 'the one and only'!) His music in combination with Amitabh Bhattacharya's lyrics tell you a lot more than the basic story itself. Sure, I would have liked the setup in the first half to have led up to something a little less anti-climactic. Sure, the pace could have been a little better in the first half, which might have made the second half look better. Yet, these seem like mere nitty-gritty when you notice the emotional high that the film has left you with. And especially when you compare it to the huge reminder it is. Of our strength, if only we choose to use it.

A strong central performance by Russell Crowe as the titular character makes the film something worth watching. Yet, the film leaves you with a feeling of it being inexplicably flawed.","There's something off the mark in Darren Aronofsky's Noah. You can't quite place your finger on it, particularly when you're watching the film, with its spectacular imagery and intense themes. Even once you're done, the film stays with you, all the while making you wonder why, despite liking the film largely, something still feels amiss.But that, honestly, is for later. It is what cinema - good, great or average - should always strive to do. Make you question it for hours after you've watched it. Aronofsky's magnum opus does precisely that, even if it doesn't sweep you off your feet completely.The Biblical tale of Noah, and the ark he built to help creation and life survive massive floods that were aimed at cleansing the world, is well known. Noah was a character that apparently fascinated Aronofsky so much that he's always wanted to make a film on him.Noah, the film, is mounted larger than anything Aronofsky has made before. Also, in a big departure for him, this time around he tackles the theological and spiritual aspects directly, instead of layering them beneath complex characters, the way he has always done so far.The effect of these on the film is a mixed bag. Visually, the film is undeniably striking. Remember, the film is set in a time period which can be equated to the infancy of planet Earth. The world itself, then, looks pristine and fresh. The skies a hue of blue we hardly ever see today, the soil and rocks look almost alien. Some breathtaking frames and some interesting time-lapse and stop motion sequences make Noah a film whose images won't exit your mind's eye in a hurry. There are also some beautifully designed CGI creatures, particularly a bunch of them made of stone; with faces that look more like rough rocks, but which actually evoke an emotion. On the flip side, even though the themes of the film - the corruption of humankind, the merciless manner in which we treat the other species we share our planet with, justice, guilt and so on - are universal, the fact is that this tale is set in a particular time. The visuals are impactful, but the characters and their stories seem distinctly - for want of a better word - 'modern'.Nicholas Winding Refn's Valhalla Rising, for instance, (even though it has absolutely no similarity to Noah in terms of story or setting,) has similar visual feel to it. The desolation, which should have come out far more in Noah, which is set millennia earlier than Valhalla Rising, is not nearly as convincing in the former as it is in the latter.Also, the fantasy element in the film is treated with a mix of edgy bravado and cautious trepidation. Almost as if Aronofsky wasn't sure if they were to cater to an adult audience or to children. Nevertheless, the VFX in the film are outstanding for the most.  Russell Crowe plays Noah with fiery intent. His physical graph in the film, as well as the sheer intensity in his eyes, traverse a journey which requires a truly committed actor, and Crowe shines. The rest of the cast, though competent, don't really have much to do. Darren Aronofsky's latest, thus, can't be distilled into bad, good or great. Even in its shortcomings, it rises above so much we usually see on the big screen these days. Yet, it will leave you with that lingering feeling; that something about this epic story seems a little off.

Non-Stop can be non-stop thrills or non-stop silliness, depending on how you look at it.  ","Liam Neeson. Distressed, angry, racing against time. The thought of his daughter is invoked repeatedly. And yes, he kicks some serious backside.Wait, no. I'm not talking about the next film in the Taken franchise. This one is all new; or at least, it claims to be. Liam Neeson, with a singularly boring name - Bill Marks - plays US Air Marshall with a drinking problem, because of the events of his past. Obviously, it has to the plane that he is on, which gets picked for some mid-air shenanigans by an unknown man with a mobile phone.It is possible to enjoy Non-Stop, as long as you leave your brains the same place that you do, before watching, say, Chennai Express. It demands dollops of suspension of disbelief, and perhaps some love for one of the finest actors of his generation, to keep a straight face while watching the film.The plot is silly and far-fetched, and the execution is typical. The protagonist is introduced as a grieving loner, then an array of characters are shown, some with suspicious demeanors, so that we know who to keep an eye out for. Everyone knows how American security has become post 9/11, particularly regarding flights, so the tension mounts along any way.Luckily enough, the film gives you no time to breathe as it sets up the plot and goes about trying to resolve it. The constricted plane setting is used well, which alternately gives you that claustrophobic feeling, without particularly getting monotonous in feel; after all, almost a hundred minutes of the film are spent inside the aircraft itself.One of the annoying aspects of the film, however, is the writing and casting of the side characters. The stock, silent Muslim; the over-talkative African-American, the aggressive, well-built bald thug-type character; the scared child on the flight; and so many more - everything in the film is typical, without an ounce of originality.Unsurprisingly, Neeson himself is the strongest thing about this enterprise. You'd think he'd be bored doing something he's done enough already, but he still manages to hold you while he is in the thick of the suspense. Julianne Moore is simply wasted, though. One of the other, minor points that I liked was the manner in which the text messages are styled in large font across the screen, when the characters send each other SMSes in the film. They were simple and elegant, in form as well as movement.  What you get, then, is a trade-off. You forsake logic and cinematic craft in favour of quick thrills, which the film has plenty of. You'll either be too busy trying to guess who Neeson is chasing, or you may sit back with the realisation that no matter what, Liam Neeson is having more fun than you are.

Which might have been fine, if only it didn't start its sermon.","It is refreshing to hear a counterpoint about a well-know porn actress. Well, it is refreshing when they are not made fun of, let alone be spoken of with respect. It is refreshing when the protagonist has a mentor whose influence stays through the film without necessarily putting him on a pedestal. However, these small victories are countered by overdrawn scenes, overwritten dialogue, drama and the was is lost with the sermon.It is not that Noor starts out with a bang. Noor describes herself with a voiceover for nearly 20 minutes, if not more. She underlines the fact that she is young by using words like hashtag and followers. Sure, she is charmingly self-deprecating but it goes on for too long. Fortunately, the writing is slightly deeper than the usual. Her character seems to be facing her own first world problems – she even referecnes Dear Zindagi - and she is suddenly shown the mirror and along with it the face of what would be “real” problems of the world. This happens seamlessly and is interwoven into her character from the beginning.If only now the writers didn't lose steam and focus in the second half. Post-interval Noor – both the film and the character – sermonizes a bit much. The scenes which are supposed to be twists or impactful hold the drama a bit too long – you are given time to predict all eventualities. Thus, whatever comes next isn't the intended shock. Suddenly, the movie drops from being a fair watch to just about tolerable. If it doesn't go further down, it is solely because of the performances. Very little feels like it is an act. Sonakshi Sinha feels like a Noor, a smart journalist who wants to make a difference in the world but also has everyday human issues that a urban girl would have. The rest of the cast supports her along well too. It is difficult to say if I'd have enjoyed Noor better if it were more focused on one or two aspects of life that it picked to comment on. The lectures in the second half were so full of themselves that it is a task to be objective about the film and imagining Noor without them.

What unspeakable, unthinkable brutality is a human being capable of, if their survival is at risk? How much more evil can the irrationality get if it is out of love, fear or anger? Not a Love Story is a dramatized version of a story that involves a murder. What makes this murder special? It is committed not by a seasoned criminal, neither by a wannabe one. Regular people, people we can see ourselves be friends with, commit the murder and worse, manage the after effects rather cold-bloodedly. And yet, the execution of the film doesn't make you feel for it any more than a newspaper item. I read the news item, shook my head in dismay, and I turned the page.Nevertheless, while I was watching the film, I was involved and interested in what Robin (Deepak Dobriyal) and Anusha (Mahie Gill) go through after a situation led them to murder. Even though, the trailers, gave away the core story. I moved with Anusha as she giggles through pretentiously and  as she faces disappointment after disappointment in landing herself a role in a film. I was unsure of her actions as she was unsure of her own motivations of how she should handle her love life. I was shocked and afraid with her. I could see Robin's love for Anusha through his possessiveness. I saw how he cared for her as he protected her from seeing gore. But, this was only and only because of the outstanding performances. Somehow, this once, I cannot make myself give even part of the credit for the actors' job to the director. One, because how can a person who makes such awful camera and sound/music decisions have anything to do with the performances? And two, I'm not convinced the director had time to direct the actors since he was so busy with the visual and aural quirks. In fact, I must give myself a pat on my back for not letting his gimmicks distracting me from the content of the film. Okay, I'm sure there might have been at least a scene or two where the bottom-up angle or the camera held upside down or the shifty jerky moves it made might have worked towards a scene's impact. But, past experiences with RGV films make me walk into a new film with the intention of ignoring all such trials, and thus I set a block for them all. Oh, and the loud background score - I doubt it worked even in a single scene. I don't understand the use of horror music in a thriller. This also added to what was bothering me throughout the film even though the story, like all stories coming out of life, was interesting and the acting was ace-class. The intention of the film was to fill me with disgust towards what a person like me can be capable of, but the music and camera wanted me to get scared. Moreover, the voyeurism that takes us to Mahie Gills short-skirt hems, the in-the-face B-grade-film-style skin-show make me roll my eyes rather than bringing out the character it is trying to build. All of this took me away from the intent when it had so much potential to draw me closer. Also, in the second half, there was an interesting court drama brewing where three versions of an event came to the forefront. But there is too little time for the game to play out, which would then mean that the film should have been longer. And if there is one thing the film got right, it is the length. So, I'll just be happy with the way the court scenes turned out. In one of those scenes, the horrified disbelief on the faces of Anusha's friends when they find out what happened - it said, ""really? No! That couldn't be."" Would you believe it if one of your acquaintances, let alone friends confessed to murder? That I think is the crux of Not a Love Story. Whatever I derived from the film was despite RGV, and that is his failure.

Despite an ensemble cast and a superb (and largely original) premise, the film runs out of genuine tricks a tad too early. Watchable enough, though you might see through the illusions far earlier than they want you to. ","If there’s one thing that one just has to grant the makers of Now You See Me, it is the fact that it seems like such a rarity these days to get a big, star-studded, concept flick that isn’t a sequel, reboot, remake or adaptation. That isn’t to say that Now You See Me has very much going for it apart from this. Despite a hooking premise and a palpable sense of tension that it creates by always seeming to have one last trick up its sleeve, the film runs out of steam by overplaying its hand a tad too often.With its foot on the pedal from the word go, the film introduces us to four different street magicians who are all united by a mysterious hooded figure for a larger purpose; the Four Horsemen, as they are then called, begin pulling off a series of grand illusions, with the continuous promise of coming back for the grandest deception of them all. Building up on sleight-of-hand tricks that we’ve seen ever so often (inspired from those by illusionist David Copperfield), the film coasts breezily along because of the mystery that it manages to evoke right from its initial frames. As one character after another is introduced, the proceedings begin to gain momentum, succeeding at least initially, in having you hooked. However, you know things are bound to go south when the film never eases up on the twists and turns, except for when it goes off on to a predictably cumbersome almost-romantic track between Mélanie Laurent and Mark Ruffalo, who play Interpol and FBI agents respectively, both of whom are hot on the trail of the Four Horsemen. The film comes a cropper in its last act, when all of the build up, the deception and the grand journey leading up the climax - the prestige, if you will – turns out to be a bit of a damp squib, with the final few twists being predictable from a mile away. Also, the film has to be one of most miscast films in recent times, with some terrific actors playing bit roles that didn’t deserve them, and which they could have played in their sleep. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine in particular, have particularly thankless roles. Even the characters played by Laurent and Ruffalo, for that matter, could have just as easily been played by anyone else. Having said that, both of them play their parts expectedly well.The Four Horsemen, played by Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson and Dave Franco, do manage to pull off their characters fairly well. Eisenberg, in particular, seems to be a chameleon; I didn’t think he could portray the suave, confident magician with the ease that he did. Fisher looks great, Harrelson is quirky as always, and Dave Franco seems a little rough around the edges, but he manages to hold fort. My biggest problem with the film, however, is how it misuses the audio-visual medium in an attempt to throw viewers off track from where it is heading, before rudely jerking them back with a twist out of the blue. Common tradecraft in big Indian as well as American films, where the fact that you can ‘show’ viewers something is misused blatantly by showing them something that doesn’t really exist or by twisting the intent of the visual, to confuse them. (Think of all those times a character has turned his back on others in the scene to give a ‘mysterious’ expression that only the audience can see, only to never be referred to again in the film, or later explained away with some unconvincing bit of back story.)This film literally derives its trickery from this concept. Alfred Hitchcock’s favourite term, ‘MacGuffin’, used to describe this device, sounds innocuous enough, but is something that I’ve personally had a problem with if not achieved cinematically. Now You See Me is pretty much one grand MacGuffin after another, shamelessly used throughout the film (and not to very good effect, I might add, if I could still spot some of the twists way before they even revealed that a twist was coming).Despite these hiccups that pepper the film, Now You See Me isn’t really unwatchable, because of a premise that genuinely held potential and a few moments that do make you sit up and wonder. If you don’t mind being played for a while and deceived more often than you’ll remember once the film is done, then you might just have some guilty fun. Otherwise, I suggest you wait for the film to come out on satellite or DVD, and go back to the 307th word of this review, for a film that I’d recommend instead.

The attempt is to keep the arguments balanced yet the film's events are way too convenient.,"OMG Oh My God reminds you of the coffee table conversations centered around faith, blind faith and the business of faith. It is similar to any argument you'd have between people who blindly believe in the hand of God and the misuse of that belief at the hands of the men of God. The attempt is to represent both sides and keep the arguments balanced while making its point. The frustration of the common man against the oppression of what should be done in the name of religion is quiet adequately represented. But, the happening are way too convenient and ultimately remain good in theory.At first, it seems Kanji bhai (Paresh Rawal) is a staunch opposer of the very existence of God. A non-believer, an atheist. He appears to be very close-minded to anything that the whole world has to say about faith. But, as the story moves forward you realize that his issue is more against the business that God has become and is even open to accepting a change in his attitude. All this is shown in interesting arguments Kanjibhai makes with high-ranking priests. The balance is thrown off with making mere caricatures out of these priests. The exaggeration of these cartoon-ish characters might have been necessary but painting them as dimwits takes away from his fight, makes it too easy for us to take his side. However, I saw balance in the climax. The story is taken beyond the apparent conclusion, the argument though stretched takes it to a proper culmination. Interestingly, the film is set in the most festive period of the year. The months in which we celebrate births and victories of Lords Krishna, Ganpati and Ram. Also, the questions related to existence of God itself are dealt with smartly. Believer or non-believer, you will see yourself smiling and questioning what you believe in.Paresh Rawal could possibly have done this role in his sleep. Not taking anything away from his heartfelt performance, he played it with conviction. Akshay Kumar plays a charming Krishna and does his bit by staying away from the limelight. Mithun Chakravorty despite his overtly caricaturish character brings a laugh every time he moves his eyebrow or moves his little finger – which is pretty much all he does. Most of the rest of the cast though are a pain to bear through and you thank God for Paresh Rawal being there in almost every scene. For people like me who are in almost 100% agreement with Kanji, it is easy to identify with Kanji. The question is how does this film effect people who have blind faith, who are superstitious, people who are represented by the likes of his wife. Like I said earlier this week, it's not that anyone can expect a film to change lifelong beliefs, but this one has the potential to at least reconsider some beliefs.

167,867,867,867,867,Oblivion,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/oblivion-review/,,,,4.233333333,"Joseph Kosinski’s ‘Oblivion’ is a massively-mounted film that feels hollow because of the larger focus on the exterior of the film rather than on its emotional core. Slow-moving and with a flawed screenplay, the film isn’t entirely unwatchable only because of how it looks and sounds, and because of Tom Cruise. ","The big problem with Joseph Kosinski’s sophomore feature, the sci-fi magnum opus ‘Oblivion’, based on a graphic novel written by Kosinski himself, is that, like his 2010 debut film TRON: Legacy, the focus seems to be more on how the film looks, as opposed to truly delving deep into the psyche of the characters, what they feel and why they feel the way they do; that and the fact that you can almost see the effort that has gone into making the film ‘feel’ like an epic. Perhaps some day filmmakers will realize that epics aren’t ‘made’; they just happen.The film is set in a post-apocalyptic future, one where Earth is nothing more than a barren wasteland, after an invasion and subsequent war with mysterious creatures known only as ‘Scavengers’; the war was won, but Earth was lost. Mankind has since developed an alternate plan for survival, and Jack and Victoria are teammates manning a station; they’re on a mission that is a part of this plan.Unable to shake off a strong déjà vu of a number of previous sci-fi action films, including The Matrix, Inception, Total Recall and Source Code to name a few, Oblivion still had loads of potential. The film starts off well enough, amidst gorgeous visuals, the sepulchral feel and the intricately enigmatic air that is created by the images of a battered Earth. Also, there is something so poetic about a vast, endless canvas that has only one man and one woman in it to represent life and the memory of what it means to be a human being. And then, there is the emotional core of the film - the fact that memories of true love can never fully be erased no matter what; that is the kind of thought that has the potential to melt even the most hardened cynics. Unfortunately, instead of exploring this emotion further, the film turns into an action thriller and a mystery. Even that could actually have worked if the film had a tight, gripping screenplay to back it up. The fact that the events unfold at a generous almost indulgent pace, again pointing to the fact that the attempt was to create a modern day classic, weakens the film further.One of the film’s other big weaknesses is the fact that what should have been the soul of the film, the love between Tom Cruise’s character Jack, and Julia, the character played by Olga Kurylenko, just doesn’t come through; the two of them share the chemistry of a pair of wooden blocks. Andrea Riseborough, who plays Jack’s partner Victoria, is quite lovely, though she is eventually only reduced to a side character. Morgan Freeman is functional, but having him on screen does make you take things a little more seriously, sometimes.Tom Cruise, I’ve always maintained, is one of last few ‘movie stars’ we have left. By that, I mean that he has this ability to make the most incredulous on-screen goings-on look completely believable; he almost lives the magic that cinema can be. This remarkable feature of the man is actually one of the only things that doesn’t make Oblivion a total waste of your time. Another undeniable plus point is the cinematography, by this year’s Academy Award winner for Life of Pi, Claudio Miranda. True, the film is heavily embellished with VFX, but it does look beautiful. The third aspect that marginally redeems the film is its soundtrack; credited to three composers, it is a nervous, edgy and heavily orchestral sound that is often reminiscent of a Hans Zimmer score, a tad over-cooked, but nevertheless one that stays true to the genre of the film. Oblivion eventually amounts to a lost opportunity; a potential epic that doesn’t even go close. A majority of the audience will be quite happy to walk out after the film and forget about it soon after. And yet, all of the above are my thoughts as a student of cinema critiquing a cinematic work. Deep down, the part of me that believes that movies are more real than real life, actually loved Oblivion just for the potential that it had, even though it never fulfills it. I completely immersed myself into the indulgence of the film, the haunting feel, the sad but beautiful frames of a thriving planet reduced to rubble and that core emotional thought; that true love is a memory worth fighting for, worth dying for. I loved Oblivion, even though it offers plenty of reasons to not be loved.

168,868,868,868,868,October,"Watch for sure, preferably in theatre",wogma review37 Critic Reviews 4.3/5.0 1 Reader Review 5/5.0 125 Tweet Reviews 4.6/5.0,/movie/october-review/,4.3/5.0,5/5.0,4.6/5.0,4.633333333,Both as dramatic or as slow as real life is. It is an immersive experience that makes you think about it well after you are out of the theater.,"October took me by surprise at so many levels. It did help that I went in knowing nothing about the film, except that Varun Dhawan was one of the actors. That might also be why the pace of the first half hour got slightly annoying. But, having seen the film, that pace makes more sense than ever. And ultimately, I am glad I hadn’t seen the trailer before watching the film because there is a good chance I would have walked in expecting to watch a very different film, a film about two lovers, one of whom is in a coma. What I watched was a very human story that is about relationships that have no whys and hows, they just are. As October progressed, I wondered, “Why are you getting involved? Why are your eyes brimming up? Why are you getting effected? It’s not like you can relate to any of the characters, you don’t think like most of them. It’s not like this is the first film you have seen about a person in coma. In fact, you have seen three in the recent past – Waiting, Ventilator, and The Big Sick. You don’t even feel like you know much about the lady in the ICU. The bits you know about the guy taking care of her is that he is simple and sweet, but a goofball. And even so, October is drawing you in with its simplicity, its humanity, its kind and large heartedness.” This is when I realised that these are things that help one take heart when the situation is grim – simplicity, humanity, kind and large heartedness. When a film does this, makes you identify with the situation and not only characters, without you even realising it, it becomes a winner. Sure, the film is slow. But, so is tending to someone in a coma. In fact, the pace is another aspect that October touches upon with so much subtlety that you don’t pick up on it until you start analysing it later. October keeps pace with the patient’s condition, it picks up ever so slightly with every small sign of her recovery. The life of the caretaker becomes slightly busier with the smallest improvement of the patient. The back and forth between practicality and humaneness doesn’t come across as a story-writing tool. It feels like dilemmas that one would face in real life, a struggle that is germane to the story. All the philosophizing aside, October’s take on relationships is as heartbreaking as it is heartening – not all relationships need two people. While this sounds like it is about unrequited love which October might or might not be about, this take on relationships is about one person’s will to care and form a relationship irrespective of what the other wants. As beautiful as that is to see on a film, in real life it could become overbearing and intrusive. Through the film, I couldn’t shirk off that nagging question, “what if she doesn’t want what he is doing?”. Which led me to questions about agency and entitlement, “is he really being selfless here?”Sure, there are no easy answers to that and the discussion could be a never-ending one. Which is again only a stamp of how endearing, thought-provoking and engaging the film is. Of course, Varun Dhawan just blew me off. While playing a good-for-nothing is completely his forte, he just showed us the many different kinds of directionless there can be. He even makes some of the wonderfully written dry humour,  just the right amount of dead. I couldn’t stop wondering why he would do a Judwaa 2 when he can do this. Bread and butter? Anything for love of family? Never say no to work? And he took/accepted third credit in the opening credits too! That is commendable. Banita Sandhu and Gitanjali Rao brought me to the brink of tears a couple of times. The rest of the supporting cast also made me wonder why we don’t see more of them.Along similar lines, I am sure that I will not have enough of the Shoojit Sircar-Juhi Chaturvedi combination – Piku, Vicky Donor, and even Madras Cafe for that matter. What a range of topics and styles that covers! October may or may not be in the same league as the first two, but it is certainly up there. When a review becomes more about the viewer’s experience, emotions and thought-flow, it is a movie well-made, a movie one must watch. Even if you might want to watch it over and over again.

Oh, My God!! (OMG) is a man's surreal success at creating discontent for himself. If only, OMG didn’t end so suddenly. Yet another fabulous performance by Vinay Pathak.","What is the aim of life? To find happiness. 
What makes one happy? Money / fame / power / other smaller things in life. 
What happens once you've experienced that? You are satisfied temporarily and then magically find something else that could make you happier.
Repeat. This aspect of human nature is explored in Oh, My God!!. The character and situation chosen are exaggerated and thus seem unrealistic in a very bizarre way. And the surreal style of narration in turn brings the metaphors in focus.Vinay Pathak, the ambitious, common man whose hopes are all attached to a multi-level marketing scheme, not only makes you empathize but also makes you identify with his character. You gradually see yourself replacing his desires with yours, even if you are scoffing at his 'scheme'. Yet, romance is one area where he seems like a misfit. Divya Dutta, his screen-wife didn't look comfortable either. Though, as an individual performer she made her small problems very real. The one-line story - a man aspires for financial growth and when he actually finds himself in the money, he's not satisfied - sounds very immature, even child-like. But when you realize that this 'aim of life' is actually only symbolic, the experience gets meatier. You could actually replace 'need for money' with anything else and the result would be the same. When you achieve it, you'd complain about the manner in which you got it. If you are okay with that, you'll lose your sleep or even sanity in trying to protect it. And this is true not only for the loftier desires. Even for a person who is happy with the little things in life, the satisfaction of one little need is only replaced with another little need. And these issues are not over-dramatized, they are just brought in as the story progresses. The dialogues start out very fresh but become preachy lines, albeit masked, by the end. Yet the events in the last half hour seem like a to-do list - a hurried culmination of what was taking its time to develop. Also, something has gone grossly wrong if a 90-minute movie seems like a drag in parts. The grainy texture (low-budget induced?) and the lack of straight-regular camera angles increased the amount of patience required while watching the movie. The continuous use of a bottom-up/top-down/wide-angle were only distracting. It's always exciting to see on screen what others make of their lives and especially attempt the heavy, ""what are we here for?"" question. And when you have someone like Vinay Pathak to take you through it, it's a pleasure. Yet, the narrative seems incomplete and the quick speech as a farewell note doesn't help either.

I say, enough already.","Is this love? To marry or not to marry? I am sure a lot of couples go through these questions - more so now than a couple of decades ago. A lot of the hesitation seems to come from experience, introspection and knowing what they want, some of it seems to come from “we are too  cool for love/marriage” self-assuredness. All well. All valid. The question is, how many such stories can I watch and enjoy, though? I had pretty much reached my limit even before OK Jaanu.Of course, I watch one after another, the romantic in me even looks forward to almost all of them. This is in the hope for that one moment of “spark”, that one fresh insight on relationships, that one instance of being together which connects me to the characters. OK Jaanu has none of these. Interestingly individually some of the departments worked very well. Some scenes, especially those shot in the Mumbai trains went well with the pace of the relationship and its confusion. The background music and absence thereof also provided just the right amount of calmness between the mad, supposedly intense love between the lead couple. Again, individually Shraddha Kapoor (Tara) and Aditya Roy Kapoor (Adi) emote what they are supposed to. A sleepwalk role for Naseeruddin Shah (Paplu), of course. Kitu Gidwani and Leela Samson (Paplu's wife, Baby) are rather wooden under the garb of being stern and having Alzheimer's respectively. Even so, the three main performances keep you going for a bit.Then you realise that you just don't feel all the passion that the lead couple is putting up for show. It is certainly not for want of trying. But it is a bit too in-the-face for you to believe it. And it seems endless. There is only so much baseless sweetness I can handle.The only thing that worked for me is the juxtaposition of Adi-Tara's relationship against that between Paplu and Baby. While I am thankful that there wasn't an overt comparison, this contrast wasn't explored either. The steady, unbreakable bond between Paplu and Baby is very similar to that between Adi and Tara and yet it is different. Are age and experience what set these relationships apart? Or is it just the 'M' word? To begin with OK Jaanu has very little to hold your interest. What with a name that seems to be an excuse for the couple to call each other by the purportedly cute nickname, “Jaanu”? As the movie moves along, you realise the filmmakers aren't really interested in getting you interested. They are just smitten by their own coolness of having brought up “live-in” relationships to Indian cinema. eyerollSo, if you get peeved off by that kind of love-doveyness, this one isn't for you. If you find it cute...naah, even then it's not for you.

171,871,871,871,871,Old Boy,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/old-boy-review/,,,,2.433333333,"If you think you saw it all with Kill Bill, think again. Old Boy is not meant for the weak hearted. Brace yourself for a vicious and sadistic revenge narrative that will only allow you to sit back for a moment. A moment to consider and question once the end credits roll. The performances are intense and absorbing, letting you sink into the gruesome force of the film. Old Boy is a must-watch because it uses violence to highlight emotions and not merely for shock value. ","How many times have you heard the phrase, “Revenge is a dish best served cold”? How cold do you think? Think deeply, about just how cold revenge can get. If you multiply that into 10, you’ll get the essence of Park Chan-wook’s Old Boy. A South Korean film that gained popularity after winning the Grand Prix at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, Old Boy will take you on a visual expedition where you’ll flinch, cover your eyes and stare in awe at the impact of vengeance.  Old Boy is the second installment of the vengeance trilogy, by Park Chan-wook, the other two being Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. The film revolves around Oh DeaSu (Choi Min-sik) who is imprisoned for 15 years, with no plausible reason that he could comprehend. He finds himself in a maze of conspiracies once he is unexpectedly released. His aim, then, is to seek revenge with the person behind the brutal captivation. This is about 10 percent of the film. It has a gripping plot, that pulls the film forward, but the true beauty of Old Boy lies in how the film deals with human emotions when put in extreme situations. It makes you question who gives us the authority to punish, how far would someone go to seek revenge- Physical Torture? Solitary confinement? Death? And the most important question of all- Does revenge really liberate you from the pain of a horrible incident? Without any answers, Old Boy incorporates a rigid mission with DeaSu and explores all those questions. You can sense his desperation. He moves between a series of emotions: anger, trepidation, regret, despair. And you move through these emotions with him. But behind all the violence, you aren't meant to lose faith in humanity but to question the depths of human destruction and witness the way in which we rise back. You can notice the similarities that Old Boy shares with films like Kill Bill and Fight Club. But it stands out because along with letting you enjoy the triumphant violence and behavioral patterns of a desperate person put in absurd circumstances, it manages to outsmart your notions without losing momentum. With the use of rapid camera movements, mood music at the right points and coloured lighting, you feel like you’re a part of a ferocious video game with that added bonus of intellectual stimulation. The three-disc collector’s edition of Old Boy has some remarkable features, including five behind the scene documentaries, a couple of deleted scenes that are equally exciting and interviews with the cast and crew. There’s also a 3-hour documentary called the ‘Autobiography of Old Boy’ that discusses the making of the film. The most interesting bit of the DVD is a small featurette titled ‘Le Grand Pix at Cannes’ that captures the response at the Cannes. Old Boy is not a revenge epic; it does not place any judgments, and yet I can guarantee you’ll end the film with a few conclusions of your own. Maybe that wasn’t the motive of the film. Maybe it was just meant to be a stylized, aggressive depiction of revenge and its effect on people. As the cliché goes, you’ll get all that and much more.

172,872,872,872,872,Oldboy,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/oldboy-review/,,,,2.433333333,"With Oldboy, Spike Lee attempted to remake gold, and has ended up with a film that just about barely turns up as bronze. Watching Park Chan-wook's original for the nth time would be significantly more worthwhile than giving Lee's film a shot, even though the source itself ensures that the film isn't completely unwatchable. ","Disclaimer time. Park Chan-wook's Oldboy ranks amongst my favourite films of all time, because it deals with my favourite themes - revenge, guilt and death, and because Park made a gritty, visceral yet stylish film that didn't shy away from pushing violence, sex and strong sexual themes to places they hadn't been to. Obviously, any remake of a film that one loves so much is awaited for with a strange mix of excitement and trepidation.Add to that the fact that the remake was being helmed by the director of Inside Man - a highly underrated film, in my opinion; so yes, Spike Lee's Oldboy was keenly awaited, despite it being a remake of a film that, in an ideal world, shouldn't be touched. Unfortunately - and this is a problem with most remakes - Lee's adaptation is a miss, because it just doesn't seem to capture the soul of the original.  Surprisingly enough, even Sanjay Gupta's Zinda, a faithful 'tribute' - to put it politely - was a stylized, if heavily watered-down version of it, was actually a wee bit more intriguing than what Lee has given us.  Even if you haven't already watched the original or the Hindi remake, you'll probably already know that the film is about a man who is, without reason, held captive for a long, long period of time, and is then, as mysteriously, released. Except, the man is now angry. And he wants answers.Even attempting to judge this film all by itself, independent of the original, one can't help see right from the start how flawed the very approach to the film is. The protagonist, Joe Doucett, is presented to us as a man with questionable morals. Not 'grey', mind you, which every human being is - but more 'charcoal', if you will. That automatically makes you not particularly care for him when he's imprisoned.Also, Joe is imprisoned during a period where humankind has seen the kind of change - be it in lifestyle or in technology - that has been unprecedented. Thus, when he steps out, the world should appear so alien to him that his disorientation should be a fundamental part of his personality. Instead of using this as an obvious character attribute, all we get are hints that Joe is unaware of Google and touchscreens.He, however, seems to be quite adept at cracking the answers to questions that, logically, he shouldn't even know to ask. Another important aspect that the film fails to get even close to right is how Joe's physical and emotional transformation must be, during and after the length of his captivity. Park's Oh Dae-Su goes from an almost-portly man approaching middle-age, to a lean fighting machine, because the wish for revenge drives that in him. You can feel that physical transformation; you can feel that burning desire for revenge. Everything in Spike Lee's remake is superficial - the emotions, Joe's journey and his quest for answers, Josh Brolin's interpretation of Joe, all of it.If there is one area, however, where this film manages to be different yet equal to the original, it is in the post-climactic resolution. Lee's ending is significantly more plausible than Park's. Then again, Park's film was all about audacity. It is almost worthy of a case study, how the exact same plot can seem audaciously original and nerve-wracking for one film, and cloyingly far-fetched for another.  Brolin tries hard as Joe, but he's ultimately always Brolin. Elizabeth Olsen, who's been out of sight for a while, is refreshing as Marie, Joe's unlikely companion on his quest for answers. She looks simple yet lovely, and it also seems like she has finally learnt how to step out of the cutesy Michelle we've always known her as, and slip into a real adult character. Sharlto Copley, seen earlier this year as one of the antagonists in Elysium, seems quite adept at playing the manic villain, even though his isn't a significant value addition to this film.It doesn't help at all that the Indian censors have clearly mutilated the film as well. A lot of the violence and sex scenes have been chopped off, and though there is still a substantial amount of those in the film, the bits that have been cut were portions that truly held the emotional crux of the story. But, really, even including those wouldn't have been able to substantially lift what is essentially a mediocre, disappointing film. The next time Hollywood wants to attempt a remake of an Asian thriller, they should just check with Martin Scorsese on how it is done, first.

173,873,873,873,873,Olympus Has Fallen,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 0/5.0,/movie/olympus-has-fallen-review/,,0/5.0,,2.15,"Antoine Fuqua’s Olympus Has Fallen is an action film that is hard to take seriously, and is best enjoyed with your tongue firmly in your cheek. Gerard Butler keeps things fun in a film that otherwise has little going for it in terms of plot or execution.","Training Day and Shooter director Antoine Fuqua’s latest film Olympus Has Fallen is the kind of generic Hollywood action film that the world has been seeing for ages now, with only a slight change in setting; this time the action occurs inside what should be the most guarded and fortified building in the world – The White House. Never easing up on the corn or the been-there-seen-that, the film mercifully whizzes by you fast enough to make it a breezy watch, albeit one where you are always only being patronizing towards it.Mike Banning, erstwhile head of US President Benjamin Asher’s security detail and now reassigned to other duties because of a tragedy that occurred on his watch, is rudely jolted back into the thick of the action when a terrorist group takes over and occupies the White House in a 9/11-meets-26/11-style brute force attack, holding the nation to ransom. With the clock ticking, Banning is the only hope that the US government has in preventing a full-scale catastrophe, while tensions are rising between two East Asian nuclear powers, the conflict between whom is the root behind the terror attack in the first place.The only time the film really had me thinking was a bit was early on, during the initial attack on the White House; because I couldn’t help feel that no matter how outlandish the events unfolding in the film looked, the White House and other such buildings across the world would probably be quite vulnerable to a well-planned attack. That moment of serious thought didn’t last long however, as, in the most blatantly obvious attempt at symbolism, the pyramidal top of the Washington Monument, the tallest structure in Washington DC, comes crashing down a few minutes before the White House is taken and someone exclaims in Hollywood-ese, “Olympus Has Fallen!” (Olympus, of course, is the mythical home of the Greek Gods, and if it really is the code name that is used for the White House, then the US Government clearly makes no bones about what they think of themselves.)From then on, because of its relentless pace and a few truly cheeky lines of dialogue, you play along with the silliness and the self-righteous Americanism that the film indulges in, even though you have no doubt how the film will pan out. Mike Banning, of course, is your everyday John McClane-type action hero – enterprising, badass and always a step ahead of the evil mastermind, even if he pretends to always be playing catch-up. He even channels Bond and Rambo often while systematically attempting to win back the White House. With some veteran actors playing bit roles as various US Government officials – Morgan Freeman, Melissa Leo, Robert Forster and Angela Bassett all make appearances – the collective seriousness with which everyone takes their roles can make you grin. Aaron Eckhart as the President makes for a dashing and charming First Man, no doubt, but I wonder how they thought of casting someone who looks younger than Teddy Roosevelt or JFK ever did while in office, as the US President. It adds another layer to the already existing farfetchedness of the film. The film, of course, belongs to Gerard Butler, who plays Mike Banning. Armed with his usual charm that is embellished by his accent, Butler makes the best use of his lines and the action he gets to have fun with, making sure that things remain almost always watchable. Rick Yune as the renegade mastermind behind the attacks just doesn’t make for a convincing-enough villain, for me. The film has been given a grim feel and it never stands out visually, maintaining an all-too-familiar look throughout. Strangely enough, some of the VFX in the film was quite bad; something you don’t expect in a film like this. The action set pieces have been executed reasonably, but nothing in the film seems like you haven’t seen it before, which as I’ve repeated often, is one of the big problems in the film. As it brisk-walks to a climax (that can’t shake of a Mr. India déjà vu), Olympus Has Fallen is the kind of no-brainer film that is some measure of fun while it lasts, without ever truly impressing you. So if, like me, you get the feeling more than once that you’re watching King Leonidas attempt to save Harvey Dent from Zao, the sidekick henchman in Die Another Day, then we must meet up for a high-five.

The movie gets marred because the makers did not have the courage to make a spoof for the sake of a spoof. It is obvious that the story was forced to make the movie sell. Had they stuck to the industry jokes, it would have been as entertaining as a gossip magazine.","It is at best a very average variety entertainment program. You have mimicry, song, dance, skit - all woven to fit a theme. Isn't it sad that the biggest ""star"" of our industry is doing the mimicry and yet it is only mediocre? And get this. Half the time he only has to mimic the hamming, hawing, grinning and face-pulling of ... Shah Rukh Khan. No guys, my sense of humor hasn't taken a Diwali break. I am intelligent enough to realize the ""spoof"" genre requires you to make minimal use of intellect. I thoroughly enjoyed the ""spot-the-tribute"" game. I am sure I got most of the industry jokes. A few of them even had me in splits. And the coolest thing was that the people being made fun of couldn't be offended because the makers were equally vehement in making fun of themselves.But, it angered me when the movie shifted gears from paying homage to the 70s to actually becoming one of them. Because movies from the 70s certainly were not this blatantly arrogant. However lame, they did afford the audience a justification. No sirs and madam, ""anything"" doesn't go - sab kuchh nahi chalta hai! - Isn’t that you wanted the citizens of this country to say Mr. Khan?The movie is reverse engineered. First came the idea of making a movie that took a dig at the movies that gave ""Bollywood"" its name. Then came the list of names/clichés/industry trends that had to be, with all humility, made fun of. Then came the individual gags. To be followed by the situations that could use those gags. This made the first half and suddenly realization dawned that the audience is not ""that"" stupid. They need a plot. So, let's throw in the first theme that comes to mind. And there you go, we have a movie. What we also have is this obvious rush to get from one joke to another and one event to another. The end product is choppy with very abrupt plot transitions. Now, you tell me, where's the time to fit in character development or chemistry between characters? Oh I forgot, spoof - no need for any such thing even if we did have time. Unfortunately, because of this excuse, I lose the golden opportunity of truly criticizing Shah Rukh Khan's acting capabilities. Spoof, right? One is supposed to overact. It is tragic that Kirron Kher also is annoyingly loud under the same pretext. So what, if in the same movie, Deepika Padukone, a debutante manages to get through with just the right expressions. And she looks drop-dead gorgeous.The good thing about having a woman director is that many women in the audience are kept happy with a very wet, bare-chested Shah Rukh for almost five minutes. A by-product of which is also a happy male, gay community. So what if the main woman lead is merely used to stun as a pretty prop?The best thing to come out of the movie is the lyrics. Especially the romantic numbers ""aankho meir teri"" and ""tumko paaya"". The picturization of ""tumko paaya"" is very adorable too. However, the choreography of the faster numbers seems like a medley of Farah's older sequences and thus has nothing new to offer. The one song that does not work is ""daastaan-e-om shanti om"". It does not have the edge, the zing, that ""ek hasina thi"" (Karz) it tried to spoof has.I think my most favorite sequence was the end credits. I love Farah Khan for giving credit where it is due. But, what does it say about the movie, if that is my favorite bit?These are no dimwits and they have a great sense of humor - Farah Khan, Shah Rukh Khan - basically the Khan family. Then, how could they take their audience so much for granted? Yes, we are in a festive mood, we are willing to lap up anything remotely happy. But, does that mean you shouldn't even attempt to sharpen the movie a bit? Each episode in the movie is a bit longer than necessary. Each cliché repeated a few more times than needed to keep it funny. Each exaggeration a little more melodramatic (imagine that!?) to make it annoying.The entire movie is a spoof. Then you have a spoof within a spoof. Then a spoof within a spoof within a spoof. So far, so good. You have learnt to excuse the joke driven situation (versus situation driven joke). Then...well, Farah Khan forgot where she had started and Shah Rukh Khan finished of the script for her. And we have this mess - moderately funny, but mess nevertheless.

Unerring, unflinching and unrelenting, the result is a devastatingly, seriously good film.There are no false binaries in the victim - perpetrator mould, indeed the film takes no prisoners. It doesn’t offer sympathies to any one cohort and heavens forbid, there is no semblance of redemption.Some of the most tragic conflicts in life embody both the inevitability experienced by those who are in it and the futility felt by those outside looking from afar, the distance, lending perspective. The film sets out and manages to convey this dynamic quite efficiently and effectively.I haven’t seen an Indian film in a while with the amount of attention to detail as on this one, right down to nailing the correct version of windows on the computer vis-à-vis the period in which a scene plays out. In another chilling scene that manifests right in the aftermath of 9/11, the two sculptures in the back of the room, the manner of holding the newspaper and a lone patrolling body guard, visible off the corner of one eye are all the details you need to know what has changed in the geo-political narrative of the day.Writing dialogues for a film such as this is often a thankless job for everything that can be said in these contexts has already been said not just via films but also nearly daily in the mainstream media. Even so, the writing is more than perfunctory; it is consistently sharp, sometimes sparkling and always, always economical.The art direction comes alive in nearly every scene, whether it is the powder grey of South Hall in London, the riot of colours in the narrow bylanes of Karachi, the treacherous mountain ranges of Afghanistan or capturing the early - mid 90’s humdrum of old Delhi.I was too young to gain a meaningful first hand understanding of George Bush beyond the uni-dimensional caricature portrayed in the eastern world when he was president. The dint of nostalgia and archival footage notwithstanding, here’s a man who began his condolences with ‘Laura and I’, eight full years before the deliberate and calculated dotting of i’s and crossing of t’s became Obama’s stock in trade. For what it’s worth, the remorse on display felt genuine too.Mediocre films tell and show. Good films show and tell. Great films show without telling. What this film never says but manages to show is how revenge sought against a wrongs committed in history is fundamentally unattainable, which explains why it never ends. It is a wild good chase unlike any other, the Frankenstein’s monster to beat all others.Holds true for individuals, societies, religions, governments and all forms of life on the planet in general. We can never have enough of what we don’t want. So long as the cycle continues, there is only one form of hegemony, brutality and violence replaced with another form of hegemony and violence. The form and the content remains the same, only the actors change.Mehta and Rao have combined to give two blazingly good films in Shahid and Aligarh. This one is a smashing culmination of a worthy, eclectic trilogy.

It's a film that explores the power that Sultan Mirza holds on all Mumbai, his love story with film actress Rehana and his rise and fall with rebel sidekick, Shoaib, who is modeled on young Dawood Ibrahim.","This is a film about Bombay, not Mumbai. It's a story about a smuggler, his lady love and his sidekick, and it's a rather filmy story. The movie is set in Bombay of the 70s, a Bombay that was slowly becoming the financial capital of the country, a Bombay that was home to everything filmy: including the underworld. Everything in the movie is larger than life, the dialogues are almost verse-like, the clothes are loud (it's the 70s!), the heroine's makeup is loud and what is most vivid is the romanticism of being a powerful don. The power play and slick narrative takes the audience in a roller coaster ride of one man's rise, another man's fall and a strong attempt to be stylish at it.The movie is told to us through the eyes of DCP Agnel Wilson (Randeep Hooda), where he tells us about Sultan Mirza, the most powerful don who arrived in Mumbai with the sea as a small innocent boy, who grew up to become a good-hearted don. It is clear that Sultan Mirza owns the city, loves the city and calls it his Mehbooba. Which is why he helps the poor and becomes a god like figure for them. The character of Sultan Mirza is precise and Ajay Devgan plays it with utmost conviction. He does a good job because we've seen him play a similar character in Company and he still manages to bring a sense of freshness to the character. Through DCP Agnel Wilson's memory we are told of Sultan's rise to power, how he respects the city by only smuggling material goods and not drugs, his love story with film star Rehana (Kangana Ranaut) and his discovery in Shoaib (Emraan Haashmi). His love story is as filmy as it gets, with a corny courtship period which lasts for 3 minutes, cheesy dialogues and song/dance routine albeit with a mature fading into the larger context of the film. Kangana is demure and looks the part of a 70s film star with all the bling and glitz. Emraan on the other hand, plays a younger Dawood Ibrahim in all sincerity. He is cheeky, arrogant and smooth in his ways, and serves as a good contrast to the mature Sultan Mirza. His determination to rule Mumbai and become the greatest power, gives us a dramatic look into what we see now, in the form of international terrorism via Dawood Ibrahim. The problem with the film comes when there seems to be not much of a build up between the king and his sidekick, as seen brilliantly in Company. Both character of Sultan and Shoaib are built very well, but the conflict is not acted out much after the intermission. More emphasis is given on punch lines for dialogues, which get tiring after a point. As an audience member, you expect more action than dialogues, and while the first half seems promising, the latter part of the film, including the climax, don't match up to the decently carved out first half. Kangana's character takes a backseat, Ajay Devgan becomes repetitive and Emraan becomes a cheeky slave to power, to a point of no belief. The performances are immaculate as they go with the overall feel of the film, it doesn't seem stale and convinces you in parts. Randeep Hooda is a raw change, in his confidence as a police officer, Ajay Devgan and Emraan Hashmi are cogent in their parts, but the film loses it edge through a script that creates a void with it's hurried climax and falling second half. Even the though the movie is out and out dramatic, at points the dialogues become too theatrical. Kangana seems sparkly and filled with potential but suddenly loses her screen presence in all the rush to make a drama out of a very narrate-able story. The background score is appealing, but the music seems a bit forgettable. The movie's obvious strong points are Ajay Devgan, apt characterization and a good story which could have churned out a better climax. Watch Once Upon A Time In Mumbai for the love of Bombay, Ajay Devgan, an entertaining story and don't expect to blown away.

It bothered me with Once Upon A Time in Mumbaai and it bothers me again with Once Upon Ay Time In Mumbai Dobaara - how exactly does one own a city like Mumbai? One wants to own it - I can try to imagine the magnanimosity of his aspirations. But when one claims to own it and everyone around him goes on for almost  three hours about how he owns it, you begin to really wonder how that works out? How does one own a city like Mumbai, let alone twice? Once I got over it, I warmed up to Once Upon Ay Time Mumbai Dobaara's style and drama, just a teeny-weeny bit. Not enough for sure, but not a complete washout either. The thing about a move which relies so heavily on its ""powerful"" dialogue is, you might indeed find four or five dialogues that invoke some kind of an emotion out of you. Either in its romance or skepticism or sarcasm or in its attempt at being profound, there might be a few lines in Once Upon Ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara that you just might remember. Only that you have to sift through tons of such lines including those delivered with enthusiasm by even the smallest of character artists. Whether or not you like it, you have to appreciate the dialogue writer's conviction at make every single line powerful. In fact, many situations and characters seem like they were created to accommodate the dialogue. Fortunately, there are other situations and characters that exist to build the themes of love, hatred and loyalty. Of the three the theme of loyalty is worked upon the most and works the best. The romance is rather lame and the hatred is purely functional. Given the huge conflict between loyalty and love, and the route Once Upon Ay Time In Mumbai Dobaara chooses to resolve the conflict, the film could've had a lot more impact. Despite the predictability, there was a lot of human element that could've been explored.But when style is a priority over content and stylish dialogue delivery over actual acting, the limitations are pre-defined. Even so, though the performances don't get you too involved with the characters, every once in a while, you do forget the actor who is playing it. You do loathe Shohaib for his audacity and for a bit forget it's Akshay Kumar on screen. This is actually a big deal considering the last few films that he has done. Imran Khan too manages to  invoke some kind of sympathy towards Aslam, even if momentarily. Sonakshi Sinha helps Jasmine hold her own against the man who owns Mumbai Dobaara and for what its worth, she does give Akshay Kumar a tough fight with her screen presence.Unfortunately, the romance has zero chemistry. There is more chemistry between Akshay Kumar and Sonali Bendre and him and Sophie Choudry in the little time they are given than Sonakshi Sinha has with either of the men. Yet, the fault doesn't lie in the performances, the writing and the choice of situations to depict romance lack oomph, despite all the superfluous style. So, laden with heavy dialogue that is attempted at by one and all, with a heavy voice, Once Upon Ay Time In Mumbai Dobaara isn't as random as the first episode, yet it doesn't suck you in despite having the potential to do so.

You wish it were an attempt with more conviction. Yet, a decent TV watch. ","You try to summarize what you felt about a film and you are at a loss. The opening sequence was cool (even if inspired), but the fart jokes were well, fart jokes; but that scene between mother and daughter was pretty well-written for a film of this genre, but the film was not paced well; but the climax was one of the best ever, but the songs are all over the place even though they are nice...And so on. That of course is One By Two. It has a chic, Hollywood rom-com feel to it, except that it is Indianized with songs, etc. So, like the ping-pong ball between Amit's (Abhay Deol) mom (Rati Agnihotri) and dad (Jayant Kriplani), you move from a well-done thing about the film to something shrug-worthy and back;  from a witty line/scene to toilet humor; from Amit's story to Samara's (Preeti Desai).However, the one big thing that worked for me is the concept. At about minute twenty, I reminded myself to note down when the lead pair would meet. And then, slowly, as the idea started getting clearer, it got interesting. But - there had to be a but, right? - the two individual stories were more or less boring. What is worse is, it comes across as the writers somehow knew it and to cover it up they added lame humor that didn't belong. The only curiosity left then, was how the two stories would intersect, but unfortunately that is not the point of the film. Samara, a struggling dancer, goes through the regular ups and downs of any story that would have a struggling dancer as a lead character. And yet, its just refreshing to see a woman in a rom-com spend so much on-screen time and energy on something other than a man. Of course, her character could have been written in better detail with all the layers that were exposed to us. Even within the limited scope, her character's relationship with her mother was given one nice, long scene to breathe. If only, it went a little deeper. It doesn't help that Preeti Desai doesn't have a whole range of expressions. This makes your empathy for Samara stand-offish. Amit's story on the other hand is stuck, just stuck, right from the beginning. But, maybe its intentional. The thing about defining your lead character a boring makes him exactly that - boring. And how long can you stick around with a boring character, let alone root for him. And yet, when Amit does the right thing, you give him a pat on his back. When he vents, you are ready for his character graph to do something that gets your interest, but remember? He is stuck. Abhay Deol does Amit's crazy venting bit with ""pakao-ed"" pretty hilariously. But, we didn't really doubt his acting capabilities, did we? What is frustrating is that the entire sequence doesn't fit in the film at all.  Amit is never shown as being frustrated with life in general, but suddenly has this outburst. The outburst makes sense, but not that Amit had it. The side characters do add a little spice to the ongoings, which are bearable to a point. And then they become repetitive. I would like to see more of Preetika Chawla though. And actually, I don't mind seeing more from Devika Bhagat, in the hope that next time, she'll make every thing about her story and the film crisper and tighter.

179,879,879,879,879,One Room Kitchen,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/one-room-kitchen-review/,,,,4.3,"One Room Kitchen, written and directed by Mahesh Tilekar, is an earnest film that is worth a watch, even if it is only for the interesting gamut of characters, their endearing interactions with each other, and some competent performances. The flavor of life in a chawl is captured with sincerity, and the dialogue will make you smile more often than not. So, in spite of the conveniently tied up climax, some obvious stereotypes and lack of technical finesse, One Room Kitchen is a film that can really be enjoyed with family.","An eclectic bunch of quirky characters living in a chawl  in Pune form the crux of One Room Kitchen, a charming little film that made me smile more than once. After the disaster called Pratibimb last week, I had considerably lowered my expectations when I went in to watch One Room Kitchen. Fortunately, not only did the film exceed my expectations by a long way, but it also raised my expectations for the next Marathi film that I watch.The story, the setting, the technique, everything is as simple as can be. However, what the characters work, their dialogue, their relationships with each other and the sheer fact that even the nicest of them have those rough edges that make them seem real. The story primarily revolves around a young couple, Ravi and Suman. Happy in their world in the chawl, their life takes a turn when Suman meets her old friend Neha, and happens to see her apartment. Thus begins their struggle to obtain an apartment of their own.The chawl itself contains a host of highly endearing characters, one more interesting than the other. So there is the smart, enterprising youth who works in a garage, the henpecked, out-of-work man with a terrifying wife and a dubious bottle of cough syrup, and the gossip-loving old couple who have been abandoned by their son. And then some. The simple script is embellished by some earnest performances that truly warm their way into your heart. Bharat Jadhav as Ravi and Bhargavi Chirmule as Suman have to carry the film for the most part, and they do it well. Kishori Godbole as Neha is extremely charming, and her character truly lights up your heart. Amongst the character actors, Vijay Chavan, Viju Khote and Ashalata stand out for their dialogues and comic timing. Rajesh Shringarpure, playing Neha’s rich, businessman husband struggles, but the cast around him often makes up for it. Rakesh Bedi, playing a sleazy Gujarati broker hams, but to good effect.Veteran actor Dr. Shriram Lagoo makes an extremely brief appearance, but his mere presence has a certain, inexplicable power to it. One surprising cameo in this film is that by Helen. I only wish she had a meatier role, one that had a proper graph to it.The film has its share of flaws. Everything gets wrapped up too conveniently in the end. The climax could have been made more impactful, instead of making it all fit like a kindergarten jigsaw puzzle. Also, the manner in which Tilekar has attempted to juxtapose life in a chawl to life in an apartment is really insufficient and even reeks of a bias. Each style of living has its own pros and cons, but the director’s tilt towards one side in this film is hard to miss. So much so that it appears that perhaps Tilekar doesn’t feel this way in real life, but has forced it into the film to make it work.Technically, the film leaves a lot to be desired. Simple things like avoiding the UV haze that forms around characters and ensuring sharp focus in shots would have gone a long way in ensuring that technical inadequacies don’t hamper the storytelling. However, in spite of its many flaws, One Room Kitchen works because of its honesty. What I enjoy in Marathi cinema is how it often captures the essence of a Maharashtrian lifestyle. This film does that. So, even though the film is not exactly a must-watch, I would still recommend it to people, only to support the rise of Marathi cinema, and to savour the simple joys of life along the way.

Funny lines - 5.  Loud actors - way too many. This wannabe comedy takes a dive into slapstick torture of third degree.,"Usually in a movie which has a promo song running along with the opening titles, I block my brain from making any assessment - trying my best not to judge the proverbial book by its kitschy cover. But, the thought just wouldn't leave me. If this is how it starts, how do I go through the next two hours? And it worked! Thanks to the lowest possible expectations set in the first five minutes, it fidgets its way half-a-point up.It’s regular slapstick with a dash of original one-liners thrown in. But, it feels like the one-liners determined the situation rather than the other way around. And the lack of flow is evident when you just shake your head in helplessness. This goes for both the dialogues and the screenplay, or lack thereof.This is one of those brainless comedies that can't be seen without a brain. As in there are three people with the same name who reach the same place at the same time. So keeping track of the chaos cannot be done without some gray-cell exercise. And, honestly, I did see this as a situation with tremendous potential for craziness. But, it’s all too commonplace and just doesn't work out.Neither do the production values - from the amateurish animation to the art design. The costume designer is fascinated by the scissors. We have holes and cuts in dresses where they don't belong. Setting trends? I hope not! These over-used, blunted-down scissors were then passed on to the editor. Low-budget, you see? Can't blame him for the jerks and jolts now, can we? Now that so much is spent on putting the cut pieces of cloth together we need people to wear them. So we have the threesome - Sameera Reddy, Tanisha, and Esha Deol. Amazingly, and I'm using the word  with all sincerity, Neetu Chandra is wearing just one costume, and is covered all over at that! Maybe those scissors were too blunt for cotton clothing by the time it was Neetu's turn. Thank goodness for some mercies!Now that we have these ladies, what do we make them do? What women do best, of course...scream and screech and yell some more. Why distract the audience by giving them such things as meaningful dialogue? Consistent character would cause an outcry. To be fair though, in the name of gender equality, the men are dealt a similar hand too. Any hopes of Paresh Rawal saving the fort are demolished in the fifth minute of the movie where he is introduced as a bra seller. Need I say more?The only people who do recognize their limitations are the lyricists. Since, they know they cannot write that well, so they wrote a few half-decent lines and got them repeated over and over till Raghav Sachar's music ran out. The latter does put his goods on display and how. A range of foot-tapping music remixed together. And he takes showcasing a step further by featuring himself in the end credits.Barely different from the other slapstick churned out this shoddiness named One Two Three is absolutely passable. Waiting for next Friday, already...

The Boss, Bruce Lee, died years ago, and Jean Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal who lit up the screens briefly in the late eighties have long sunk into oblivion. 
The scene in the East is none too encouraging either, Jackie Chan and Jet Li are ageing and showing it, so is there an action hero out there, to win our hearts and strike fear into the enemy?Yes, dear fans, do not despair, all is not lost yet. Tony Jaa detonated onto screens around six years ago with Ong Bak, where he showcased the particularly brutal Muay Thai style of kickboxing. This was the real thing, no wires, no CGI, no bullshit. Produced on a shoe string budget, Ong Bak and Tony Jaa went on to carve out their rightful seat in the martial arts pantheon. 
Tony Jaa is back this summer with Ong Bak 2 and this time he is clear about what he wants, he wants nothing more than to be known as “The Action Hero”.The film opens with a spectacular sequence featuring a crocodile, a Cyclops like bruiser, spurting arteries, and barbarous weapons. What more could a viewer ask for? The pace is set and the ride then blasts off. Amongst all the action sequences, the director does make an attempt to tell a story. The story has the familiar motives of revenge and retribution and the telling does plod in parts. The sequence of events unfolds through a circular back story where the past catches up with the present. The director has thrown in a few “reflective” moments, which seem designed more for the viewer to remind himself / herself that he / she is still breathing after witnessing all the carnage onscreen. A brooding, long haired Tony Jaa stalks most agilely through the film and very wisely utters not more than a few lines of dialogue throughout. His large, luminous eyes, do manage to convey a degree of suffering and give a hint of the inner tortured soul that his character possesses. So what does Tony do in the film? Well, he does everything there is and more. He tames and rides wild elephants, displays his mastery of various martial arts styles including Japanese sword fighting and kung fu, dances a traditional Thai dance, and even has a romantic interest. The romance is fleeting and only hinted at in a couple of scenes. There is a spectacular fight at the end which just goes on and on with Tony fighting one masked black clad opponent after another. There is also a beautifully choreographed fight set amidst, what else, but a live elephant’s tusks, what will we have next!
The ending is abrupt and unclear; after all the fighting the film just sort of blanks out. Tony has the moves no doubt, he is fast, he is supple, and he has the power. In one scene he pays tribute to Jackie Chan, as he pounds the villains when drunk, in another, he fights with a three sectioned staff, a tribute to Bruce Lee and his whirling nunchaku.  This film is lavishly mounted as compared to its predecessor, but suffers due to its length. The length seems to have been purely for the purpose of making sure that the viewer gets to see Tony do his stunts and fights in different contexts and in different styles. Sometimes it palls, but Tony’s intensity carries it through. The fights are bloody and savage with no quarter asked and none given. Martial arts fans; make sure you see it.

182,882,882,882,882,Osthe,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review,/movie/osthe-review/,,,,4.5,"Osthe, the Tamil remake of Dabangg, just doesn’t match up to the original. Both are equally inane, but Osthe ends up being a generic action flick with no major redeeming factor unlike Dabangg, which had Salman searing the screen with his persona and action. Lead star Simbu is endearing, but no more. The music and action don’t match up and most importantly, Osthe doesn’t have the distinct flavor that Dabangg had, which brought single screen audiences back to cinemas in hordes. Tamil audiences have seen similar but far better films than Osthe, and there is no reason why this film will make a mark. People who hated Dabangg should stay away. People who liked it should stay further away. ","Like it or not, it is true. Dabangg is one of the most influential films in contemporary Hindi cinema. It has, in its own fist-thumping, water-hose twirling way, defined the kind of films we are subjected to these days. Unfortunately, Dabangg has to endure the ignominy of being clubbed with the very same films that have attempted to cash in on its hysteria. So people will always say Dabangg, Ready and Bodyguard in the same breath, even though Dabangg is so much more than the tripe that has followed it.The film has even managed to buck the recent trend of South Indian films being remade into Hindi, by inspiring its own Tamil remake. Osthe, starring Silambarasan (Simbu) in the lead role, stays faithful to its source frame-by-frame, so much so that it even gets bicep-flexing baddie Sonu Sood to reprise his role. For a multitude of reasons however, Osthe falls way short of Dabangg.The superficial reasons are plenty. Dabangg’s Chhedi Singh becomes Osthe’s Boxer Daniel. (Yes, really!) Malaika’s Munni becomes Mallika’s I don’t know what. The dialogue writer repeatedly invokes Rajnikanth’s Sivaji The Boss, only to say that we now have Osthe - The Mass. (I’m still rubbing my eyes in disbelief at that one.) Surprisingly, Osthe is nowhere near Dabangg even in the technical department. The action isn’t nearly as well executed, and the VFX look just mediocre in most places. Also, the action sequences are poorly cut. The songs, though, are extremely catchy, especially the title track. However, there was a certain naughty innocence in the soundtrack of Dabangg that Osthe just doesn’t manage to recreate. Needless to say, I don’t even remember the tune of Mallika Sherawat’s item song. And then there is Salman Khan. Make no mistake, Simbu (or ‘Young Superstar STR’, if we are to believe the opening credits of Osthe) is endearing as hell. He has style, dances well, is athletic, and has a charm about him that is hard to ignore. But few in the whole wide world can match up to Salman Khan’s blazing screen presence, especially in a film like Dabangg, where Salman seems to have had the time of his life. Even the sentence ‘Simbu’s shirt gets ripped off in the end’ sounds like someone is trying to make Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus out of Lego.As I said though, the above are merely superficial differences. (Yes, even Salman Khan.) The reasons why Dabangg works and why Osthe doesn’t lie far deeper. Dabangg isn’t great cinema, of that there is no doubt. However, Abhinav Singh Kashyap never pretended that that was what he was making. The makers of the film reveled in the ridiculousness that played out on screen, rendering popcorn passé and celebrating chana jor garam instead. In the process, Dabangg also captured a wonderful flavor of the Hindi heartland. Try watching Dabangg without looking at any of the central characters or action, and you’ll know what I mean. It may not seem so at first sight, but Dabangg was well and truly ‘different’. Osthe, on the other hand, just follows a long line of similar films that have been coming out of Tamil Nadu since time immemorial. Punch lines, style, action, catchy songs but no real plot – all these elements are not new to Tamil cinema; they can make these films in their sleep. When they wake up, we get Vinnaithandi Varuvaya, Alaipayuthey, Anbe Sivam and the likes. 
Simply put, Dabangg will, for right or wrong, always be remembered, while Osthe will just fall by the wayside. The only thing that is remotely comparable in these two films is the fact that Osthe’s lead actress Richa Gangopadhyay is as inconsequential to the film as Sonakshi Sinha was.
One wonders how director S. Dharani and the producers of the film didn’t realize that what they were making was so hackneyed; that no matter how much they proclaimed their lead actor was a superstar, the only way they could make this film memorable was if there actually was an attempt to push the envelope, to do something different. Ultimately it boils down to the simple fact that Chulbul Pandey will be a character that won’t be forgotten in a hurry. Osthe Velan, on the other hand, is bound to fall by the wayside.

183,883,883,883,883,[The] Other Guys,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/other-guys-review/,,3/5.0,,4.5,"A laugh riot, The Other Guys is one of the funniest comedies to come out of Hollywood in 2010. Nominated for Best Comedy at the 2010 Golden Globes, it features some sparkling comic timing and dialogue between the two misfit, loser cops played by Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. Looking for flaws in this film is a meaningless exercise - it’s similar to finding logic and reasoning in a Sajid Khan film. The screenplay still throws up enough laughs, so I’d suggest you watch this film with friends, on a relaxed weekend.","Mark Wahlberg is suddenly becoming the Akshay Kumar of Hollywood. The man with a rather straight face, is mouthing absurd, yet funny lines (“I’m a peacock! You’ve gotta let me fly!”) The same way that Akki would do in a Priyadarshan film. Wahlberg’s traits work nicely when paired with Will Ferrell, quintessentially funny man, in The Other Guys, a film about two detectives in New York’s police department who do nothing more than mundane paperwork on existing cases, rather than be a part of adrenaline pumping car chases to nail down criminals like real investigators would. Although Hoitz (Wahlberg) wants to go out and shoot some guns like real cops do, he struggles to inspire his geeky desk partner Gamble (Ferrell) to rise to the occasion and together, become the city’s heroes. The humour essentially lies in their mismatch and the pairing of the two actors is funny. There is some crackling dialogue, most of which had me in splits thanks to both actors complimenting each other well. Hoitz leaves no stone unturned to let Gamble know how much he hates him, but the total nerd that Gamble is, he doesn’t mind. Captain Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton), who plays boss to both characters is equally funny as the senior cop with a bisexual son, and who has a weekend passion of running a supermarket which sells luxury toiletries. The film is a wonderful product placement for the Toyota Prius, the car that the lead actors use for most of their assignments. I loved the way the car’s features were embedded with Gamble’s character and mannerisms. The writing and performances have enough to provoke laughter and these comic scenes are well-connected to ensure that the film is not just a series of gags one after the other. There’s something about staring at Will Ferrell’s face that produces a tingling in my funny bone. He’s one of the better slapstick actors, but one who doesn’t have to try too hard to show off his comic timing. The film is an action comedy, against the backdrop of the embezzlement of funds. There’s action - lots of it, most of which is pretty well executed. But the screenplay is patchy, a bit formulaic and I’m not sure if I can blame the writers entirely - action comedies as a genre continue to be like this. The non-stop bullying from Hoitz and Gamble’s colleagues seems forced. Moreover, I couldn’t fathom why Hoitz would want the calculator loving Gamble to join him in his investigative pursuits. How did the two become partners in the first place? A bit of history into how they met and how they became resigned to boring desk jobs, would have added some colour to the story. The sub-plot of Hoitz’s failed romance and his ability to do the ballet really well, doesn’t add up to the film’s overall proceedings in any way. The extras on the DVD are a bit of a lip-service. There are some deleted scenes - meaningless, most of them. However, the behind-the-scenes footage of the stunts is interesting, as are the interviews with the director and the actors.The Other Guys has got several flaws, in addition to everything that comes with a formulaic script. But it’s a funny film alright.

Their laments reached the ears of the old king who was then sorely beset.  The noble king grew weary and thought “Is there not within the bounds of this kingdom, a champion, a mighty Knight who would rid the land of its scourge? And if not, May the Gods perchance send us one such?”...  It has been years since Hollywood served up a good, hearty, sword and fantasy epic.  The eighties were full of them what with the likes of Conan The Barbarian and other low budget imitators.  Director Howard McCain takes a plot that is as old as the hills, incorporates a new twist, and gives us a film which is surprisingly enjoyable.  A similar film called The Thirteenth Warrior starring Antonio Banderas appeared in the 1990’s directed by John McTiernan (who also gave us Predator and Die Hard).  Outlander’s plot includes elements from both Predator and The Thirteenth Warrior but the treatment is significantly different.  Outlander stresses more on the human relationships that exist between the characters; the themes of Belonging and Acceptance, family, community, honour, friendship, loyalty and chivalry are all nicely brought out.  This is not to say that the film eschews action; but the director seems to have struck a neat balance between the fights and the human relationships with all the dexterity of a high wire artiste.  John Hurt is suitably beleaguered and noble as the old King Rothgar and Sophia Myles is his fair daughter, Freya.  James Caviezel is lean, stubble jawed, and has black short hair; the clear Outlander amongst the long haired, blond Norsemen. Caviezel’s portrayal of a character lacerated by guilt and suffering is expressed through his blue eyes and minimal speech.  His acting is surprisingly good given the fact that he is the Hero in an action adventure film! (maybe all the practice that he had from The Passion of the Christ has stood him in good stead!)  Ron Perlman appears in a small cameo as a twin axe wielding warrior and looks mean enough.  And how could one forget the Creature?  The special effects are great, and the Beast is as good as any as we have seen on the screen, all hell fire, fangs, and whip lashing tail.  The screen play elicits chills, spills, and emotional highs from what is otherwise a very predictable plot.  The climax too is gradually built up, with a sudden twist at the end, and when we think that yes it is all over, it is not yet time to leave.  The film has a message too, of a very topical and contemporary kind.  Outlander is a film that utilizes all the elements of its genre: a lovely heroine, a fierce and most potent Beast, a lonely Hero, and a band of unlikely comrades.  It is quite enjoyable because the director has taken care to add a certain minimal depth to the main characters and to blend in themes of Hubris, Loss and longing as well as Fate and Free Will.  Sit back and enjoy.

With a smart sense of humor. But, a very dull plot with no ups and downs to keep you interested.","Skip the italicized bits to read review. The italicized bits are my thoughts on the on-going war in Mumbai interspersed in between the review.Over 40 hours since the country has been held hostage. Each one of us hostage to TV channels, internet reports, or twitter and some of us hostages inside the Taj, or The Oberoi or Nariman House.  Each one either scared or worried or angry or frustrated or some combination thereof. But each one of us helpless. What can we do? Abuse the government, opposition, media? Did that and got bored within 20 minutes. What else can I do? The only thing I can think of is to panic as little as possible and continue the routine. So here I am doing what I do every Friday. Trying, albeit unsuccessfully, to ignore what's happening 150kms away, trying to keep my angst on the world outside from making a judgment on the world inside the dark, secure(?) cinema hall. So, there's this thief, Lucky and he does what he enjoys doing best - stealing. So, he starts off as an insolent youth stealing, he steals as he grows. Then steals some more. And repeat. There is no high point in the drama that makes me curious about the end. feel like sending a text message out to see if the drama in the real world seems any closer to an end.Of course, he steals cars and carpets and all things expensive. But he also steals teddy bears, greeting cards, and family photographs. Fine. He does it with finesse, charm, and presence of mind. In fact, the ease with which he steals is ""almost"" unbelievable.Well, if a city can be set on fire so easily, then...Now the promos claim that he steals your hearts too. Uh...no...Well, Abhay Deol, the actor's, dimples are cute. But there is only so much he can do within the confines of what Lucky, his character allows him to do. He's smug, doesn't take life too seriously and has an arrogant sense of humor that keeps a smile on your face through the two hours. 
this is weird, I'm smiling and yet my eyes go misty every time I think, Mumb...Three cheers to the dialogue writer...Though, of course, the point of the movie is not to make us laugh. It is to tell a story. Of this man who is so endearing that you supposedly don’t mind him stealing - Bunty and Babli style. But the story doesn't tug your heart. I see no reason why the police should get all pal-ly with Lucky.or maybe I've just gone numb. After all, I'm in this theater watching a movie on this day of terror...there you go Mr. Terrorist, I won't get terrorized, I'm desensitized now! BOOHOO to you!!! There is this subtle comment on how an otherwise insensitive guy is completely bowled over and gullible when he's treated as family. And this because he has had a troubled childhood because of his family. It also comments on the media-mania. In fact the official site has director, Dibakar Bannerjee saying -
Ouch! What timing...I'm sorry guys, I'm going to cop out of this one...the plot  doesn't hold much water; it is a smart-ass comedy with decent actors who have wonderful accents. I need a story or a good narrative that engrosses, didn’t get either.Stay safe...

Even if the comedy doesn't work all that well, it is a film worth a watch for sure. ","Rajkumar Hirani has a knack for attacking a problem headon but with a smile. As usual the issue is important, and given the events of this week, it is of global significance, though PK doesn't necessarily spread its wings that far. While the jokes are slightly on the lame side, the point made is powerful even if readers of this site might not be the direct target audience for the arguments.Most of the citybred, Generation Next a la the multiplex audience is already on the story-tellers' side. We would make the same arguments in a coffee table conversation. But the beauty here is Hirani keeps it simple. With single-minded focus he attacks the problem, quite literally, using child-like innocence. His use of humor, didn't make me laugh or even smile, but the entire theater was in splits, especially most of the first half. For matters of such importance, that most people are getting more and more right of center about without thinking it through, it is just important to get the audience to listen. So, whatever works. What worked for me the most is that PK was PK and not Aamir Khan. Sure, his mannerisms did feel a little exaggerated but they became a part of the character. After a long, long while a character he played didn't remind me it was him. In fact, while jotting my notes, at one point I found myself writing Anushka Sharma to PK! That form me was another victory for the film. Not that Anushka Sharma didn't perform well, it was easier to remember her as the actor rather than the character. A lot of the other players too - Saurabh Shukla, Boman Irani, Parikshit Sahni keep the film on its mark without attracting too much attention towards them, which is no small feat in itself. Else, Hindi films are so proficient at making caricatures out of Godmen that it is a welcome relief when it doesn't happen.But, PK is not one of those films that would need extra points for what it didn't do. It has enough going for it. Rajkumar Hirani films aren't great works of cinema in terms of other departments of filmmaking. They keep their background music, camerawork, post production to the minimum. Their focus is on the writing, (with a few diversions in form of songs and a romantic track). And they don't even rely too much on subtlety and symbolism.In fact, these are films when the characters are as uni-dimensional as they get. Also, ironically, you have to take major leaps of faith as the films have a boatload of flaws and over-simplifies complex issues. It is irksome at most times, yet you are willing to let it go. Because the films say it like it is, and keep you engaged while making a point without becoming too preachy. That in itself is a full plate. Fortunately or unfortunately, sometimes that doesn't bring anything new to a person who is on the same side of the argument. The same concern I had with OMG Oh My God. Blind faith and misuse of blind faith that feeds on fear is something we have to deal with on a day-to-day basis. So, the points made in and by PK are drawing room conversations you and I might have had umpteen number of times. It's good to see our point of view represented and presented in a manner that should make sense to those who follow God and more importantly Godmen blindly. I would applaud it for finding the balance and not defying the existence of a supreme power. To say the film focussed only on one religion would be completely missing the point. It is up to us to extrapolate it to the religion of our choice, including our own. How many of us will ""get it"" and be able to internalise it is a completely different question altogether. Every Hirani film coins a phrase that eventually becomes common parlance, ""jaadu ki jhappi"", ""all is well"", ""Gandhigiri"" and now ""wrong number"". Fortunately, one you don't mind taking.

And it does so successfully. As if that weren't enough it is all put together in a relatively unusual plot and has one superb performance by Amitabh Bachchan which overshadows brilliant performances by the rest of the cast too.","When I start writing my opinion of a film, I usually close my eyes looking for that one thought that is a wholesome description of the film. In most cases, where an actor's name does the deal, the film doesn't have a substantial plot. It would fall apart if that actor was not playing the said character. This doesn't hold true for Paa. The first thought and the last one are Amitabh Bachchan and Amitabh Bachchan only. But what comes in between is extremely valuable to the audience's experience and to the core of the film. Sure, there are many aspects pertaining to the challenges a single parent faces while managing a child with a rare disease. But, there are enough nuances touched upon to make the viewing worthwhile. That is, if such a performance is not gratifying enough.My apprehension before the film was that the entire do will become about Amitabh Bachchan, the star or the real life father-son relationship or equally worse, a combination of both. I'm so glad my apprehensions were absolutely uncalled for. You realize Auro is Amitabh Bachchan only when you make yourself think about it. Else you wouldn't even realize its him. Of course, a lot of that is due to the make-up artiste. Any talk of the film without a salute to the make-up person and the costume designer would be a complete disregard for these art forms. And yet, none of them would have been enough if it wasn't for the stooped shoulder, the expressive eyes, the quivering lips, and so on.  Now, before this piece becomes an essay on the Big B, let's move on to the other aspects of the film. You but cannot refrain from nodding your head in approval at the portrayal of politics even if it is mostly over-idealistic. Amitabh's performance along with Vidya Balan's elegant composure completely overshadows Abhishek Bachchan's depiction of the young, dynamic politician we so badly need. And despite dealing with such heavy topics as these, the entire film has a very light tone, right to the end. Every time the going gets a little serious, little Auro, has something hilariously spontaneous to say - just like children always do. Then there are these things which are over-simplified. Like the overall compassion with which people from all ages and backgrounds treat an abnormal child. Also, the social acceptance of an illegitimate child and his mother was a tad too uneasy to digest. It is obvious that these issues were intentionally left out of the equation to help focus on the characters and their relationships. But these issues are conspicuous by their absence. Similarly, the whole comment on parents' complete disregard to anything creative as a source of living was in bad taste. A wee bit exaggerated it was, in order to get those extra laughs. Also, the maturity that 12-13 year olds show seems a bit beyond their age. The climax too seems a little too melodramatic compared to the tone of the rest of the film. Usually, films that deal with topics as varied as politics and rare genetic conditions leave you with a feeling that it should have been 2 different films, but this one blended the two together very well. Or they are interesting enough that you don't mind seeing them at one go. It was almost as if these are the two burning issues R. Balki wanted to talk about and he had only one film to do it in. At the very least, Paa documents the state of media and current affairs of the country in the naughts. For the longest time now, I've been waiting for an Amitabh film that I really enjoyed. Finally, it's here. I wouldn't want to adjoin any more superlatives to his performance and the challenges he must have faced in getting it all right, I would want you to go and find out for yourself. Yes, you there…go get those tickets for you and your family!

It's high time cinema took a look into the dark side of the pathetic manner in which sportspersons are treated in this country. And Paan Singh Tomar does that with empathy and sincerity.,"Paan Singh Tomaris the angst of an athlete who did the right thing and tried his best to work within the system to get justice for himself and his family. But then he was pushed. Pushed beyond his limits. And then he turned into a revolutionary, what we call a dacoit. The irony, that he got more recognition as a dacoit than a sportsperson representing his country in international events, never stopped to boggle him. Does it bother us though? Then, why hasn't the situation changed in the last 40-50 years?Even now, the plight wouldn't have reached us if it were not for Irrfan Khan who plays Paan Singh Tomar. He completely bowls us over with his simplicity and then, frustrated aggression. Moreover, after Paan Singh turns into a dacoit rebel, the pride of a military personnel and a national-level sportsperson never leaves his eyes. He is very rooted in his cause and yet reminds you where his heart lies, time and again. Mahie Gill provides wonderful support by showing us why she is Paan Singh's vulnerability. And this must be that rare film when a character who plays a prominent part in the first half of the film disappears later and the disappearance seems justified. Paan Singh had to forgo his family life including his wife, after all.Paan Singh Tomar invokes your curiosity by exposing the rebel Paan Singh before telling us about how he was as a sportsperson. That created just the right amount intrigue because as the flashback progressed you wanted to know how this simple, straightforward person took to becoming a dacoit. Paan Singh's achievements as an athlete is shown in good detail and so is his transformation into a person who had to take the law in his hands. The part where he becomes feared and successful as a dacoit is sorely missing. And that according to me is the film's biggest letdown. The meek and largely submissive Paan Singh suddenly becomes a dreaded outlaw and we are asked to take that as a given. And despite this major gap in the writing, Paan Singh Tomar is commendable and recommended watch because of the issue it tries to address. If there is one thing about sports in our nation that needs dire attention, it is the condition of and apathy towards our non-cricketing sportspeople.

I understand the greed for money and bureaucracy is rampant in the most private of corporations, including schools. But, to showcase the entire corporate and publicity sector as the meanest, most heartless people is a bit too much. Our rotting education system needs desperate attention, but spare me the lop-sided one, please.","Boy, do we have a superlatively inept schooling system or not? I should know. Educated myself in degrees I never had any hope of being interested in. The brilliance of the system (teachers, parents, government, and the kids) is that I didn't even realize it! It didn't even occur to me that I could have a creative streak? A complete 180 degree overhaul is a must, in everyone's attitude, including the students themselves. A powerful medium called cinema many a time takes the responsibility of showing us our flaws. Paathshaala is rather regressive, in this age, when more and more schools are trying their best to get out of the rut. Unfortunately, the film does such an awful job, that you want to hold a mirror for them. 
So, let's give it a shot. Getting the credit-where-it’s-due part done with - At any time, dealing with a non-standard topic to make a Hindi film is a huge risk, so that is something I really appreciate. Also, whether I like it or not, a point of view is presented on a contemporary topic. Also, it'd have been so easy for the writer/director to have plugged in romance, the ensuing songs and maybe even a related complication or two. But the refrain is evident. Also there are some sweet moments every once in a while. You'd think someone who's smart enough to make that decision will also use logic, at least partially, in the rest of the story. But apparently that's too much to expect from an FTII product (I wouldn't have said that, if he hadn't tagged it with his name in the titles!). So, you pick a pertinent issue and then go ahead and pick the most extraneous factor to focus on. I mean, ""schools becoming businesses""! I could've borne the issue - you know, audience has no say in what topic writers should choose in the first place, right? But, there are just SO many things wrong with the examples and sub-plots chosen. First of all, how can 100% of the people involved in reality shows and publicists not be so inhuman? You want to stereotype directors of TV shows, ok. Granted. But assistant directors, photographers, agents…everyone is living without a heart? And then you have some more heartless people in the management of this school. If these things are not agonizing enough, you have other inexplicable silences and characters blind following other characters without any rhyme or reason. So many tiny sub-plots seemed like they were there to squeeze in a point which might or might not flow with the rest of the screenplay. For example, the Hindi and Marathi teachers don't like the fact that Rahul (Shahid Kapoor) was an English teacher. Not only do we not know why they carry such an attitude, but it conveniently changes in the very next sequence!?! And such short stories are in abundance. And let's not even get to the laughable climax to the main story. In this ambience, Nana Patekar, Ayesha Takia and Shahid Kapoor do the best they can with this lame script and inane lines. Even at their worst, each three of them could have chosen a better script than this. Oh well…Schooling is not so superfluous. The argument that school facilities to be updated in moderation is half-baked. Monsters don't rule television shows. And the evils of money-making is just way too ""old-school"". By the way, what's so wrong about a school being profitable? Also, how does charging more fees make a school evil, if they are providing the facilities? And what is so wrong with having good infrastructure? Isn't access to latest possible technology a necessity rather than luxuries? It's not like the intention was to build a school for the poor, if you think teaching has to be philanthropic. No clue why teachers shouldn't be paid competitive salaries. And no clue where that money will come from, if it's not from hike in fees. Another profession that nobility is demanded of is doctors. Why should a person who has spent 27-28 years of his life educating himself not earn for himself?!

190,890,890,890,890,Pacific Rim,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/pacific-rim-review/,,5/5.0,,5.15,"Guillermo del Toro promised a gargantuan experience at the movies with Pacific Rim, and as far as the scale of the film goes, he doesn’t disappoint. Enormous monsters clash with ginormous robots to deliver some astonishingly grand thrills, even if the film doesn’t really have an emotional core to invest in. Fun while it lasts, visually spectacular, but it isn’t likely to pull you back into the theatres again. ","If, like me, you stay right until the end of the credit roll of a film, right till the screen goes black, then the final title card of Pacific Rim will warm your heart. “In memory of Monster Masters Ishirô Honda and Ray Harryhausen”, it says. Indeed, it wouldn’t harm at all, invoking the memory of the man behind Godzilla and that of one of the pioneering masters of visual effects and animation, when what you’re trying to achieve is on the scale of Pacific Rim.It takes a special kind of vision to imagine and execute a film with a canvas as large as Pacific Rim. Yes, it may be your typical Hollywood summer blockbuster film - humanity under threat from gigantic creatures they can’t control, rallying back to take the fight to them, no matter what the cost. Been there, seen that and then some. Still, that doesn’t stop it from being an exhilarating ride because of the sheer enormity of the frames that Mexican fantasy virtuoso Guillermo del Toro’s vision brings to life.Del Toro doesn’t waste much time anywhere in the film. The premise is established with documentary-style footage right in the first five minutes. Humongoid monsters called ‘Kaiju’ have risen from deep beneath the Pacific and made life on earth, hell. In counter, humankind develops massive war machines of their own, known as Jaegers. The Jaegers are match enough for the Kaiju, at least initially, until things start going south.In designing and executing the Kaiju-Jaeger world is where the film trumps all of its flaws. The atmospherics and scale of each fight sequence put every previous film in this genre to shame. Yes, Jaegers make Transformers look like little plastic toys. With terrific detailing in the universe that has been created, in the physics of the movements of machines and monsters larger than anything we’ve ever known and in the sheer mammoth planning of every action set piece in the film, it just doesn’t let you pause to think about just how ridiculous the plot must have seemed at the script level.This is Del Toro in his element, displaying a familiarity and penchant for all things fantastical, going out there and making a film he believes in, and doing a terrific job with it. Yes, the film also attempts to deal with familiar themes of loss and redemption, of sacrifice and victory, of the triumph of the human spirit. In fact, every single time the film pauses to dwell on these bits is precisely where one is most likely to get bored in the film. Guillermo del Toro isn’t particularly adept at breathing cinematic life into cardboard characters, and it seems like he hasn’t tried too hard either. He just wants you to have a smashing good time at the cinemas, that is exactly what he promised, and that is exactly what he delivers.Save for Idris Elba, who plays the only character remotely able to evoke emotion from you, none of the other actors have anything to contribute to the film either. The only brownie points they get are for delivering some amusingly inane dialogue with a straight face. Let’s get one thing clear, human beings are only there in Pacific Rim because otherwise, no matter how beautifully magnificent the actions scenes are, it would seem pointless to not have it serve a purpose; like the damsel-in-distress in a superhero film.But at the end of the day, the human beings are just a distraction in Pacific Rim. This is a film about monsters and robots. The Kaiju are so large that you never ever see even one of them fit into a frame in its entirety. The Jaegers are so gorgeously colossal that every single one of them will possibly either take your breath away, or make your jaw drop to the floor, or both. And every time a Kaiju and a Jaeger are in a frame together, the theatre screen simply looks too puny to hold them. They wrestle, tumble, hammer and fling each other like lumbering hulks, and every time one of the creatures lands on the ground, you can almost feel the earth rumble right to your heart. Yes, the astronomical order of events does get to you by the fag end of the film; the gargantuan magnitude of the monster-robot battles can get exhausting. There is simply too much size and too little actual content in the film for it to be a truly memorable experience. There’s fun to be had, but don’t expect to be moved or emotionally caught up with anything in the film. Quite like the Jaegers themselves, Pacific Rim is immense in dimensions, but doesn’t have a beating heart.

Worth a watch – for the avoidable struggle a common man went through because of the many social factors – even if not on the big screen. ","Of course, Padman is about a man who cared for the well-being of his wife and sisters. But it would be unfair to think of Padman as just a “period” film. It is as much about rural India, superstitious India, an India that finds breaking away from tradition worse than a death sentence. And I am sure this is true of many countries, not just this one. Societies with families that find it difficult to finance basic needs, but spend that and more on faith – must surely exist outside India too. So even as Padman is about changing the way in which women manage their menstrual flow, it’s reach is far beyond the boundary of this country and the topic of menstruation. I am glad that Arunachalam Muruganantham took up the onus of making affordable sanitary napkins. I am certainly glad there are being films made on the man, his zeal, his persistence, and his invention. And I am equally glad that it got star-backing from Akshay Kumar in Padman. Let alone boys and men, if the film changes the attitude of even a handful of girls and women towards menstruation from the “hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil” to that of, “baah, what’s the big deal”, it is a success – irrespective of box office status. Yes, there are women today who speak about periods much more liberally than when I was growing up. But we are hardly enough. This shocking indicator cannot be repeated enough – only 12% of Indian women use sanitary napkins. As far as the film goes, you can tell that the writing and direction are trying very hard to keep things light. Be it Laxmikant’s (Akshay Kumar) sense of humor or Sonam Kapoor’s bright smile and breezy presence. If that’s what it takes to reach a larger audience, so be it. I was caught off-guard by Akshay Kumar’s performance. From the beginning, he just came across as the simple-minded, progressive villager he is supposed to be. Sonam Kapoor as Pari, Laxmikan’t enterprise partner, fit in well too. In contrast though, Radhika Apte (Laxmikant’s wife) looked a little out of place. Her shame, her helplessness, her concern for the family budget all came across as rather functional, if not superficial. This though is not the actor’s fault. She isn’t the focus of the writing. Neither is Laxmikant. Sure, the other characters are all in relation to him, as in his wife, his partner, his friend, his mother, his sisters, yet he is not the focus. The focus is clearly the story, or to take it a level further – the invention and the social milieu that called for the invention. From financial deprivation to money-and-fame driven attitude, from societal pressure of what’s appropriate and what’s not to a take on faith and religion – everything in Padman revolves around the invention. So, even though the film points at all these issues, it is still a lot about how to make an affordable sanitary napkin, to the extent that at some point I felt like I am taking a repeated, factory tour of a sanitary napkin machine shop. This did get a little repetitive and tedious after a while. And of course, for a film that addresses social taboo around menstruation, it defeated the purpose that “the stain” was still taboo. That’s when you remind yourself that, that’s real life. Despite these issues though, it is good to see this tender, caring, determined man’s road to discovery. I am not sure the extent to which the film sticks to the events of the true life story, but from this TED talk by Arunachalam Muruganantham, the first half looks like it has largely stuck to actuals. Of course, there is the unfathomable move from Tamil Nadu to Madhya Pradesh. Maybe it was to keep things politically correct, who knows? The love angle is another question mark the film left me with. The especially broken English that Laxmikant delivers his speech in, is another one of those cinematic liberties that the film could have done without. Instead it would have been a nice touch to show how the man was approached for the film. But, I guess that would be called chest-thumping. It’s amusing that a film that revolves around the social fatigue of “what will people say?” can’t show a bit of reality because of “what people will say”.On the other hand, Padman has refrained from some common Hindi film traps. For instance, from 20 minutes into the film, I was waiting for Akshay Kumar to burst into a know-it-all, holier-than-thou monologue. But thankfully, they ducked that one. I guess, it helps that real life isn’t about preachy speeches. As with many films based on true-lives, especially those that inspire and have a social cause at the core – it is difficult to separate the cause and the personality from the film. And thus comes the inevitable question – is it enough for us to know about such a life? Or has the film been able to take the public discourse a step further? Will my teenage son and daughter talk more openly about periods with each other; with their friends of the opposite gender? Are they more sensitized? Will you and I consider giving our domestic help a pack of the ironically named “Whisper” with their salary? Will we hide the pack as we give it? Does it cross social boundaries if you almost force them to talk about periods uninhibitedly as we would have our kids talk? This last question, I am sure, is for another film.

Not Bhansali’s visual best either. Yet, Padmaavat keeps you interested in Padmavati through 165 minutes, just not as interested as Khilji is in her. ","You support it. You want it to do well just because. You even walk in with a strong hope to like it. It will still need more than grit and valour to make a film seem like it’s well-made, especially when it is over 2.5 hours. That aside, it is equally heartbreaking as it is infuriating that such furor has been allowed over a fairy tale. Fictional as the historic character, Padmavati might or might not be, queens and princesses have never been glorified so, even in fairy tales. This woman plays nurse, is witty, strategizes war and political moves, hunts deer, plays nurse, sews clothes, is a dedicated wife and dances with elegance and grace wearing a 50 kilogram ghaghra (gorgeous skirt). Okay fine, I am exaggerating, but it still weighs heavy enough for a leading newspaper to cover it – 30 kilograms. Only in a fairy tale can valiant kings and barbaric ones, both be romantics at heart who are adept at flirting and romancing. Only in a fairy tale can a warrior king who wants to rule the world be swayed not by beauty, but by the mere description of beauty. That too when the description isn’t even particularly poetic. Sanjay Leela Bhansali is to be blamed here for he is the one guilty of making macho men and empowered women into blinded lovers. It’s not that it can’t be true, but it is getting repetitive across films and you feel a ‘been there, seen that’ feel. This déjà vu cuts across from characters and situations to the sets and the costumes – which would have been fine for I could spend another two hours looking at films that look like Bajirao Mastani and Ram-Leela. Except that Padmaavat is a tad underwhelming in those two departments that you watch a Bhansali film for. While it is not his finest work visually, every frame is still picture-perfect. That’s how good his other work is. Unfortunately, the music is not even a patch on his regular fare. The dances too are visually less mesmerizing to the ones in his earlier films. Yet, they are interestingly choreographed. And this might not necessarily be a good thing. ‘bint-e-dil’ came out of nowhere and was mildly amusing and Khalibali’ madcap steps made me worry for the 100 dancers’ knees. And that I worry for knees and general well-being of performers certainly means I am distracted from the story. The one-line plot is as ‘good versus evil’ as it gets. It is an absolute one-sided view. Not that I wanted to see a dietified version of the Khiljis, but there surely must have been aspects of the Rajput royalty that failed. Or maybe the subtle hints that pointed to their failings is all we can get for now – hints at how totally incapable Rajput men were at strategizing or how a Rajput king can completely ignore a first wife after the second one enters the scene or how Rajputs allowed child brides and pregnant women to be led to their deaths under the veil of honour. In that sense, Padmaavat is a story we have never seen on screen before. However, these subtleties, if at all intentional, are few and far between. The writing otherwise holds no emotional connect – not even that occasional moment of warmth or terror that you can expect from a Bhansali product. As far as characterizations go, I take film characters at face value. I do not expect them to be what I think they should be nor do I have an image of an ideal villain or hero or side hero. I try my best to not ascribe externalities like religious intent to them. In that sense, I did not have issues with the one-sided portrayal of Ratan Singh or Alaudin Khilji or Padmavati or Nagmati. There could be a story when one man is an epitome of the values he represents – good or bad. I don’t suspect manipulation of religious sentiments or pandering in any of that. For me the basic problem is that they are black and white – literally, attire-wise; figuratively, as per the principles they stand by; behaviourally, according to the actions they take. Because this is what makes the story predictable and boring after the initial exposition.In such a scenario, we could say that each actor tried their best and yet was lacking. The pick of the lot is of course, Ranveer Singh. Some of Khilji’s mannerisms feel so much like Ranveer Singh’s offline persona and yet you don’t really think of Khilji as Ranveer Singh. You realise it as an afterthought when you are thinking about the performance. In comparison, it looks like Deepika Padukone and Shahid Kapoor muster what they can weighed down by all the costume paraphernelia. Deepika Padukone gives her sincerest best while trying to be inspirational. But often she is caught staring into the distance – which is what Shahid Kapoor does through and through except for that one time he delivers a line just like his father, Pankaj Kapoor. That ‘staring into the distance’ connection is just about the chemistry that the lead couple has. Their love for each other seems forced or at least, it pales in comparison with that between Jim Sarbh and Ranveer Singh or can be considered even less than the love-and-hate relationship between Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh – who don’t even share a single frame. In any case, the performances aren’t engaging enough to keep you from wondering about how tired the actors must be from wearing and taking off all that magnificent make-up, jewelry, and costumes.You have ample time to wonder how much budget would it take for a Hindi film to get special effects close to those from Hollywood – at least to the level that actors don’t look like wax models of themselves. You have enough room to observe Ranveer Singh’s carefully designed boorish look. And that you observe all of this instead of being engaged in the narration or being taken over by the visuals, is a let down.   As far as the depiction of history or portrayal of feminism goes it is a tight-rope act.  While Padmaavat portrays unacceptable acts as bravery and there is also merit in portraying that those acts were indeed considered brave in that time and age. After all, the film is declared as a portrayal of a queen as she was presented in a poem. The poet thought of her actions as brave, exemplary and something that should inspire her entire clan and make them proud. In that sense, the film is consistent in that those were also times when it is claimed people stuck to their principles come what may. Therefore, what to us seems like naivete and stupidity was virtue then.This trail of thought along with the constant zoning in and out from questions about costumes, budgets and computer graphics keep you from enjoying Padmaavat. Fortunately or unfortunately, they are all an intrinsic part of the lackluster story.

Even if you are ready to take the flight of fancy with a boy who's seriously troubled because his mom made him play girl-roles in films when he was young, it won't be a fun ride at all. ","The tagline of the film says ""The unbearable lightness of being"", a lovely book by Milan Kundera. But, I couldn't figure how that relates to the film. All I can do is the make this superficial observation - it is anything but light.The film starts with the a child-star's mom being devil-incarnate. And there is one more. Now, these moms are absorbed in their need to live vicariously and imposing their aspirations on their children. So absorbed that they are not only willing to sacrifice their child's sexuality, but also their sexual orientation. The focus here though is the mental trauma that the child goes through.

Unfortunately, Pappu Can't Dance Saala is not worth it despite Vinay Pathak.","Sometimes you can judge a book by its cover. Pappu Can't Dance Saala offers not an ounce more than what you would expect after you saw the trailer. The problem is that you expect boredom after watching the trailer.The story is good ol' boy-meets-girl with a dash of city-village divide and a topping of opposites-attract. There is no humor, no spark, no emotional involvement because of the dreary situations and the monotonous dialogue given to fill in the details. There's only so much that a brilliant actor like Vinay Pathak can do. Even though this time instead of the happy-go-luck simpleton, he plays the angry-irritable simpleton, it feels stale. I refuse to blame the actor just yet, the film is not fresh in its take or its treatment. Neha Dhupia annoys as desired by the character in the beginning but that too quickly begins to fall flat once you see a her absolutely uncivil, inconsiderate character grow a heart. Again, can't blame the actor. Though casting her as a dancing superstar and moreso Rajat Kapoor as a choreographer is laughable. Rajat Kapoor who doesn't move as much as a finger in the name of dance through the film. I mean, thank goodness for some mercies and all that, but why cast him at all? Don't tell me there aren't enough people in the Saurabh Shukla-Vinay Pathak-Rajat Kapoor camp who couldn't have danced to prove why the character was so reveled. There are a couple of moments in the film between Vinay Pathak and Neha Dhupia that are endearing, but that's too little to make a film a worthwhile watch. There is also an attempt to draw a balance between antagonist and misinformed attitudes between cities and small towns. But the first problem there is that in order to bridge the gap, the differences are shown in the same old stereotypical ways. By the time you see the modern views warming up to traditional ones and the traditional ones reciprocate, its too late. The second problem it's all too preachy.Similarly, the effort taken to enlighten men to menstrual cycle woes is sweet and all but it's too in-the-face. It reminded me of the contraception ads in the 80s where one friend would explain the concept to another. This was one way to handle it and it didn't work, next time maybe we can try using sensitivity in order to sensitize.I liked the attempt in the beginning to call off the ways in which a woman uses her fairer-gender card to her advantage. Using a man who sees through it and wants to treat a woman as his equal and thus won't allow her to gain out of it, went very well with how the character develops later. Only such a man could see, appreciate and accept a woman for what she is instead of just see her as either weak or as a converse characterless. So many meaningful points to make and yet no cigar. Such is the sad story of Pappu and his inability to dance.

A shade less creepy than the previous film, this one is still frightening enough if watched alone at home. ","The Rey family moves into a house which, their nanny claims, is haunted. After a burglary they put up cameras as a caution and find unseen beings in the house. The entire movie is shown as shot through surveillance cameras, a feature that I loved. The concept is obviously not new, but gives the whole movie a really eerie feel. The repetition of shots and the build up of tension is good. But I was disappointed by the number of times that I was led to a state where I thought something intense would happen, and it turned out...well, not so intense. This movie is intense, but requires patience. As compared to the previous movie, this one is a little less horrifying. But that probably is because you expect something to happen all the time. It has the same skeleton as its predecessor, but the finishing is different. There is nothing new or surprising though. And every scene doesn't necessarily have something mystic happening. That comes in at the right time, and is effective in making you jump. Of course, you don't understand every bit of the story either. But the general look of the film is such that some of it needs to remain in confusion. As to explanations, obviously don’t look for any – it’ll leave you disappointed. What I didn’t like was that, in a theatre you have college kids around, who will obviously comment and hoot at the wrong times, diluting the tension. How can you expect me to be scared when someone says in the middle of a bloodcurdling sequence, “Grab the pan and hit the ghost, silly!” I liked the way the day and night scenes of the same few places in the house are shown through the security cameras. Molly Ephraim (Ali) acted really well for a teenager. The adults were all fair in their performances, nothing commendable. I wonder how they got this child who plays Hunter to do all the crying. For those who have seen the first film, you might find this sequel a wee bit mild. But for those who haven’t, these sequences will keep you thinking, and sure they’ll keep you scared. To get a real feel of the terror, buy a DVD and watch at home. Alone.

Layered, stark and sensitive, it is a tale told with disarming affection on the one hand and relentless doggedness on the other. At another level, the film is a unicorn – it is rare, nearly non-existent beast that is unapologetic about letting its women be. Just be.   Rani (Tannishta Chatterjee), Lajjo (Radhika Apte) and Bijli (Surveen Chawla) are three women united not so much by their common miseries but their uncommon, rousing but entirely believable joie de vivre (exuberant enjoyment of life). Anguish and unfairness find ever new ways to seep into their collective lives as indeed into the lives of the other women in the village and the film takes us on the journey of their travels and travails. It is a fine, often heart-rending narrative told without fear or favour.   Rani's unnerving silence in the face of constant uncouth behaviour and debauchery by her son Gulab is a terrifying glimpse into the power of conditioning and its vice like grip over who we become and what we are capable of doing, despite clearly knowing better. And how its greatest power is in first making us blind to its obviousness and then blind to the blindness itself.   The film is not without its glitches - the ending which is well, after all the stereotype breaking, a hark back to an old one. The 'cave' scene works only as a stand alone one and not as a part of the larger narrative. Elsewhere a few threads in the story are left open.   Leena yadav's direction is raw, clear-headed and decisive. The applause needs to be for what the film is saying as much as for how it is saying it. As an aside, you'd think that roping in Russell Carpenter to shoot the film would be a minor miracle until you recall that she managed to cast Ben Kingsley for her last film.   Speaking of which, the film is beautifully cast. All three women, as indeed a host of supporting characters, shine and shine luminously. While Radhika Apte's craft and graph have been on the rise for a while now, her turn in this film is one for the ages. Surveen Chawla is a revelation - not a trace of self-consciousness in a performance that is above all, pitched oh-so-right.   The dialogue hits home and how! Everything that the men utter has its toes dipped right into the patriarchy that we see and have come to expect. Some of the dialogue mouthed by the women too, are fresh, pithy and very effective.   Twice, over this past fortnight, we have had films that deserve to be celebrated. If Pink was about the living reality of three urban women in their fight for freedom, Parched is a film of three rural women and their struggle to hold on to the last remnants of their dignity.   I, for one, came away enriched with multiple things: a new vocabulary of eclectic cusswords, but just as memorably, a film that I was happy to have had a chance to see, be surprised by and eventually savor.

Ugh. Guess that is what makes it a decent horror-thriller? ","When the objective of the film is to make your gut wrench and evoke nausea, and it achieves in doing both, you would have to call it a success, right? In that sense, Pari works. Of course, this has to be taken with a pinch of salt because I am easy-to-scare in horror films.  But, why a movie has to be repulsive, even if for brief moments, to be terrify its audience, is beyond me.For a horror film to work, the first thing that needs to go right, is the acting. Anushka Sharma and Parambrata Chatterjee play the duality perfectly. She is vulnerable, he is protective. She is fragile and needy, he is the provider. She is violent, he is thoroughly confused. Rajat Kapoor is rather effective in playing both good and evil simultaneously. On the other hand, Ritabhari Chakraborty’s act comes across as affected. Having largely crossed the first thing that goes wrong with a horror film, an Indian one at that, next comes the paraphernalia – the background music, the lighting, the camera angles, the prosthetics, the use of silence and so on. These too largely go well with the general sombre mood of the film. Sure, there are the usual tropes of horror films. There is constant nagging feeling that something is going to go wrong. You expect horrifying looking people and they appear, you expect disgust and it doesn’t disappoint (why?!).  You know the character looking for something is going to turn around to find something they don’t expect or even if they expect it is going to be more horrifying than they and you expect. So, if you are a seasoned horror film person, a lot of this might disengage you. For the others amongst us, who are weaker at heart, it done well enough that we are counting the minutes to the end of the film. That leaves the overall story and the details of how it plays out. Here the film is rather uneven. The build-up is brilliant, you know bits and pieces of the puzzle way into the second half. You are trying to piece it together when suddenly, in five minutes, the entire mystery is told. Ye, not shown, told. I guess you could thank the writers that they didn’t have one character narrate how smart they were, instead they had a character figure it out for himself. But, ultimately to you, it is told. Then the film is misleading. The first half wants to make you believe that it is not the supernatural story you thought it was, but more of a character falling deeper and deeper into her mental illness. And suddenly it falls right into the supernatural realm. The saving grace is that it is different from your other supernatural films. There is a little more detail. Detail that equates period blood to poison, but nevertheless detail that the sect in question believes in. What the film doesn’t tell you upfront though is that the makers are not going to hold back on the gore. One short moment in a morgue at the beginning of the film is enough for you to expect the worst through every moment of the film. So, that is what I went through for the 135 minutes. Words of a friend who is equally, if not more, averse to horror films rang through, “why would we want to pay money and set the amygdala to fire up with fear voluntarily?” I claim to do it as a part of my job. What’s your excuse?

At first, it felt good to get away from the daily drudgery that life is and submit myself to the histrionics. But, a few very good laughs in exchange for an arbitrary bunch of stories thrown around a Hollywood chick-flick are not good enough. It is difficult to retain interest when you can mouth out the punch line for more than half the jokes. And even more difficult when the attempts at wise-cracks stop too.","An open mind helps. I laughed out loud a few times in the first half - playing along, humoring the makers, taking silliness at face value, generally taking a chill pill. Really, otherwise I wouldn't have ""liked"" the movie even this much. But, the jokes took a sudden dip in the second half and the last half hour literally wore me out. I will make my peace with being labeled a stuck-up. I don’t care much for the David Dhawan style of escapism and I certainly don't think we were missing much while Govinda was away pulling faces in the parliament. So, obviously, by transitivity I am certainly not big on the David Dhawan-Govinda combination. (Ok, no need to get all geeky on me and bring up the nitty-gritty of the theory.) The point is that if you fall in any of the above categories, you are at the wrong place.Having offended 64% of the Hindi cinema-goers, I must reassure the rest of you that I am in no way trying to infuse any intellect into a David Dhawan presentation. Lest my intellect be questioned. Still searching my heart and soul desperately - looking for something more than a few jokes to like the movie.Unfortunately, I am also not into Salman Khan, his biceps (or his jokes on showing them off), or his very intentional melodramatic dialogue delivery. Oh well...might as well go ahead and say that Katrina Kaif looks more and more like a plastic doll with heavy make-up on. The good thing is the director was smart enough not to give her too many lines. Oops! I just lost another 34 (31 + 3)% of the Hindi cinema goers. Lara Dutta on the other hand, is looking prettier by the day. And somehow that has also improved her acting. When ideas are copied from some other movies, obviously making a frame-by-frame copy adds no creative value. But, when you see the additions made to Andy Tennant's Hitch in Partner you begin to rethink your unwarranted and utterly ridiculous demands for creativity. When there were no songs for the first 20 odd minutes, I thought I had dozed off at some point and missed a whole load of fun. Though I must say that they were making up for it with the extra background score and loudly delivered lines. And when calamities come they come in battalions. I was shown song after song with music that you could tap your feet to but was missing the extra something that makes a song memorable. And well, the lyrics lack soul. But, the good thing about Salman and Govinda is that they never disappoint as dancers. Though I could have survived even without their pelvises being thrust here, there and everywhere (sitting in second row from screen did not help!). But, then can't really complain, can I? It is a David Dhawan movie, after all. I must admit that this is more than the regular slapstick that has people chasing people and throwing stuff at each other. There is the regular slapstick (Govinda with pants down, et al) + a missile chasing Salman in a scuba suit (Oh come on girls, wipe that drool!!) + a choTa Don with the Don theme music in the background + etc. Sounds like fun to you? Go for it!  May be the last 2% of us should form a self-help group so we can begin to understand the rest of our race.

Fabulous acting, nice compact script, very focussed direction. If I have to knit-pick I would say the things that didn't work were the aimless talk about Gandhiji's philosophy and the role of the American - only because his character's purpose was not explained properly - though I have my own ideas about the latter.","Have you ever left the cinema hall with the word “wow” written all over your face while your eyes are weeping your heart out? This is the kind of cinema that highlights the balance needed in making a movie out of a social issue. The balance needed between the thought provoking subject itself and the actual art of film-making. The acting, the characterizations, the relationships, the drama all have to contribute to the story, or else the audience’s attention is diverted from the topic at hand and the very purpose of making the movie is lost. The movie is real but not boring. The fact that most acts of terrorism occur right in the middle of a normal day has been highlighted beautifully. The audience can feel the tension but not the characters who are going through their daily routine. However, this movie is not as much about the riots as it is about the aftermath. This reality has been brought about with a minimum amount of drama. A little cinematic liberty, which seems out of place, is taken towards the climax. But hey, you are watching a movie after all.It manages to tell the story to that section of the audience which did not know about the degree of the violence, without grossing them out. And yet shocks even those who could visualize the atrocities from what they read and saw in the media (in 2002). The movie very obviously is from the Muslim point of view, but then again, they were the ones who were victimized the most.  The acting leaves you spell-bound. Sarika’s immense talent has been underrated all these years. Because of which it is very easy to take Naseeruddin Shah’s usual yet exceptional performance for granted. Corin Nemec puts up a good show too. However, what exact purpose his cynical character serves is unclear. It could have been to show the impact internal riots had on a neutral person. Or it could be to point out sarcastically how Indians are nice to people because they are ‘white’ but a few days later they are cutting throats of their own nationality. Or it could be a way to find distributors at least somewhere in the world. That could also be the reason behind keeping the base language English. The only other things that did not work were that it got a little preachy at one point and the hints to Gandhism were not fully fleshed out. You should try and make a trip to the theaters for this one, because it is certainly not going to have the same impact on a small screen. While you see and hear of a village being transformed into a slaughterhouse, you will try to absorb the fact that this happened in reality. Also, you will realize that this is the story of just one family. How many more were affected by these riots? How many more are effected by all the terrorism around the world year after year?

We have had many movies that comment on our inept system and control-freak older generation, they usually become a tad too dark. Patiala House keeps the balance towards being light. But completely messes up the good, strong start that it gives itself by going the clichéd route. ","Either you or someone really close to you has been a victim of patriarchal monarchy. That makes the first half of Patiala House so easy to identify with. But in vain because the second half is diametrically opposite. Patiala House goes all filmy on us, not that it’s a surprise given the director's earlier ventures and that it is an Akshay Kumar film and that it is set in Punjab of the UK. Now there's a stereotype that justifies itself if there was one. And it is frustrating as a viewer.A well-established, decently-performed, smartly-edited, first hour sinks into mediocrity just as the characters are talking about trying to make most of their average lives. Here we start off with - 
- a brilliantly balanced view about racism, changing times, generation gaps, deep-rooted Indian culture, and its misgivings; 
- a pointer that each family has a a-la-Nirmala-from-Khoobsurat type strong and respected personality who keeps the family going and yet is the villain; 
- arguments for and against a characters and what made them the way they are;
- a comment on human nature and how most of us are ready with a scapegoat to blame our failures on; 
- a woman's need to be a savior and how she invariably falls in love with the guy who she thinks needs her How and why, why, why does it change into ridiculously quick, or rather, convenient character transitions, lame situations, clichéd resolutions, and a oh-not-so-fun walk towards the climax?? It barely looks like the same person wrote the remaining hour and a half. The standards set by this very industry make us expect a loud film whenever there are Punjabi characters, and with a name like Patiala House, there no room for doubt. But the silent first few minutes come as a lovely surprise. The grainy flashback interspersed with Parghat Singh Kahlon/Gattu's (Akshay Kumar) current life gives you hope of a good couple of hours ahead. This anticipation is met with a screenplay that sets up a good understanding between Parghat and his father, Bauji (Rishi Kapoor). Alongside, it also reinforces the equation that bauji has with his family and the larger community. It introduces you to and makes you comprehend his thought process. He was the one who stood up against racists. He was the one who brought dignity back to the community that was wronged. Of course, people respected him for what he had done. Of course, this fed his ego and he was proud that peopled followed his will like it was law. And of course, there was unrest. All this without a dialogue to that effect, just through performances. And yes, I had actually begun enjoying an Akshay Kumar film. I declare cricket to be the mantra! Patiala Househas done for Akshay Kumar what Chak De! did to Shah Rukh Khan and dare I say Lagaan did to Aamir Khan - bring out one of their best, if not THE best, performances thus far. It is pure joy to see a loud actor like 
Akshay Kumar play a meek guy and yet not make the character look like a buffoon. Equal credit to the writing and direction. How I wish he didn't break the bubble by slipping into Akki-mode every once in a while, especially the romantic moments. Fortunately, there weren't too many of those. His love interest, Simran (Anushka Sharma) is not the focus of the story. Her strong character knew when to step on the sidelines which also made her look inconsistent. But then again, the focus of the story was Bauji and not Simran, so who cares, right? Yet, Anushka certainly does her best to help Simran bring a smile and more from the audience. The lady has a screen presence that is rare even a part of it is owed to overacting - she is bright and refreshing. It might not stay fresh for too long if she continues to play the same type of a role again and again, though. Another woman who is just effective by her presence is Dimple Kapadia. With barely a couple of lines for her, she registers her silent protests. The rest of the cast is apt in being bitchy, resigned, cool, caricatured, confrontational, and so on. A reasonable variety of characters is on display only for the pack of cards to fall. I guess I'll just thank them for not doing the many things they could have done to go overboard in the last few minutes. Oh well. Anyway, with Valentine's Day coming up, you'd expect a romantic movie to be out this Friday. But, I guess, no popular holiday can replace the cricket world cup that begins next week. Unfortunately, Patiala House is a lame opening ceremony, especially with god-awful camerawork that captures the cricketing moments. Anyway, a half-good ceremony is only half-good (pliss to appreciate my attempt at inane commentary!)

While the film has, at its heart, an honest story, it is let down by poor technique and direction. Apart from failing to capture, in any measure whatsoever, the essence of the struggle that one has to truly endure in Mumbai, it also fails to explore some potentially interesting characters and relationships. Poor attention to detail adds to the woes of this film. Though by no means an unwatchable film, one sorely misses a strong directorial voice in this honest story.","Paulwaat quite instantly makes one feel that though it isn’t particularly novel or brave, the film has an honest story. However, apart from the fact that it is technically quite amateurish, the film’s biggest problem is that director Aditya Ingale just fails to inject the same honesty into the film’s treatment.The story, in spite of being nowhere close to new, does strike a chord. A young, middle-class man leaves a settled job and comes to Mumbai, that grand merchant of dreams, to pursue his artistic aspirations - familiar to most and to some like me, intensely personal. The film then traces the struggles that follow and the relationships he crafts along the way.The ‘struggle’ is a concept that the protagonist, Anant, knows he has to go through, but somehow doesn’t seem to fully understand. At times this seems like a deliberate character trait. There are times, however, when it appears that the character just wasn’t developed enough.The relationships that he gradually forges also give the feeling that they aren’t explored completely. Chief amongst these is the one he shares with his spirited landlady – a tough-as-nails, no-nonsense woman with a sad past and a tender heart. Then there is Usman bhai, a veteran classical musician who has seen only struggle throughout his journey of life. Their stories, though touching, seem like pages from an incomplete book.Technically, the film leaves a lot to be desired. The shot-taking and cutting are often plain shoddy. The lead actor Subodh Bhave (playing Anant) doing a fairly decent job. The rest of the cast lends adequate support. The music is mostly functional, sometimes pleasant, but never memorable. The highlight of the music is a soulful song sung by Asha Bhosale, my personal favourite playback singer.Then, of course, there is the lack of attention to detail. Even though the entire film is set in Mumbai, nearly 80% of it seems to be shot elsewhere, something that is extremely conspicuous. The silhouette shots of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link that appear at intervals are simply not enough. Usman bhai, who is supposed to be a Hindi-speaking Muslim character hailing from the North of India, seems distinctly not Muslim and not  North Indian. While such details are important in cinema, they are still at a superficial level. This film’s biggest problem lies far deeper.For a struggling artist/performer who is new to Mumbai, one of the biggest factors contributing to the struggle is the city itself. It is a hard place to live in, even harder to make a mark in. Thousands of dreams are swept into oblivion every single day. When you use public transport and have to travel all over the city to show your work to the men holding the puppet strings, it takes a physical and emotional toll on you. These little details needed to be woven into the film at a visual level so subtly that they would gently creep into the subconscious of the viewer. That is what contributes to a soul-stirring cinematic experience, and that is what is sorely lacking in this film. The fact, then, that local trains don’t find even a cursory mention in the film can easily be forgiven.In the end, Paulwaat ends up being like that ordinary cup of coffee you have some mornings. It does the job that it was meant to do, but it doesn’t nearly satisfy you.

Some characters are both male and female. Nothing else distinguishes one from the other. But the jokes are timed to induce enough laughter.,"You know those plots for typical slapsticks where four good-for-nothing men are friends for some reason. And for some reason or the other end up homeless and are looking for a landlord to fool. Or these friends have a good-natured landlord, with a beautiful relative, who one or all of them have an eye on. Or the good-natured landlord/landlady is being harassed and the foursome come to the rescue. Well we have all the four element in Paying Guests. And guess what? It doesn't mask itself by having some random name, it says at the upfront, ""Paying Guests"".First things first. The plot is a clear and outright copy of the Marathi film Ashi Hi Banwa Banwi. What can you say when the writers don't even bother to change some of the details? Of course there are a few changes, especially towards the end. But then the changes are copies or MAYBE tributes to other films. Despite all of this though, you are laughing. I'm an inch away from being a self-proclaimed slapstick-hater-thus-basher. You can imagine how the ego hurt when I found myself laughing unstoppably at some of the lines. Of course, I had to rationalize it. Many, if not almost all, the jokes are predictable. They are timed as you would expect from ace comedians/actors like Javed Jaffery/Shreyas Talpade. Though even they couldn't pull off being dressed as women and not look distasteful. Chunkey Pandey and Ashish Chowdhary manage to get a few smiles out too. Yet, there's nothing spectacularly remarkable about the comic timing of the joke per se. The hilarious bits were the reactions of the actors to the joke itself. This is best experienced rather than read about. Now, is the experience is worth tolerating 2 hours of non-stop non-sense? Especially with the inevitable loudness and exaggerated body language associated with the genre. With people running helter-skelter, hiding in closets, and banging into stuff. This brings us to the entire range of non-acting and over-acting - from Delnauz to Riya Sen to Celina Jaitley - the eye candy remains just that or not - you read some of the names on that list, right? The characters and story doesn't seem to have received much attention. And yet, the silliness of the climax is just beyond expression. It so looked like the makers were a couple of pegs down...actually make that four, when they were writing/shooting it. And you might do well downing a few too, to enjoy this one.

This Aamir Khan production obviously laughs at everything in the system. Peepli Live  slyly laughs at you and me, the audience who finds such a dark world funny. 'Farmer suicides' is not the only issue that Anshu Rizvi, the writer is referring to. Peepli Live points a finger at things far beyond and the irreparable(?) fault deep down in the crux.","A 600-seater multiplex hall is filled to capacity for Peepli [Live] a film that has no stars, is about a remote village, and the promo material has made it obvious that one cannot expect any glamor out of it. We know now that the 'we serve masala because that is what the audience demands' days are numbered. fingers crossed Yes, the crowd seemed to be enjoying the film. I understand that 'enjoying' is a rude word to use when you are talking about a film based on others' misfortunes. But it seems only valid, when you see people laughing at dark joke cracked along with the huge roar of laughter every time a cuss word is used.Once the novelty of seeing everyday talk on screen wares off - the whole-range of Hindi foul language, the young easily-amused boys giggly girls do get involved in the rotten situation that our state is in - at least more involved than one could imagine most of them in reality. Pathos of the central character comes through without him having to speak more than 5-10 lines in all of 100 minutes. Such subtlety runs through Peepli [Live]and every once in a while reminding you of the moot point it's trying to make. The obvious commentary on the unintelligent coverage of issues by the media, to the absolute ridiculousness of Government yojanas (subsidy/benefit/upliftment programs) is continuously punctuated with references at the level underneath.  It is up to us then, to dig deeper. Going just a skin-deeper there's a ton to see: Contrast between two strong women - one urban, one rural - one empowered and 'master' of her life if not others, the other at the mercy of the feeble men in her life; suicide must not come easy to farmers close to death either; left to the mercy of news-creators a dying farmer's feces and Saif Ali Khan's smooch are competing for headlines - is everything that hunky-dory?; all is not lost for there is a conscientious young bureaucrat/politician/journalist out there. His soul has not on sale, at least not yet; there is more hope because the simpleton will rise and make his own decisions despite the entire world wanting to take advantage of his situation; and on and on and on. So many things are being said at once - using the lyrics, the music, the backdrop, the props - that in the first five minutes you decide to stop being overwhelmed as you promise yourself another watch to grasp more. This first time I decided to absorb the surface. The performances are so close to reality that it almost feels like a documentary. The focus is on developing and presenting the situation rather than building characters and their arcs. The photography adds to the 'real' milieu by having a home-video feel - with the intentional shakes and jerks. There are some exaggerations, no doubt. And they make the film a little too slapsticky for my taste and also for the tone of the film. Then again, they are only an extension of what we've seen in real life or read in the papers. The newsy nature and the manner in which the situation rolls out also makes the film predictable. So, what next? A teeny-weeny bit more than 'nothing'? If even one bureaucrat/politician just scratches his head after watching the film, [Peepli Live] should consider itself successful. Audience? Hopefully, it won't be mere fashionable to like the film. Hopefully, a few of us will go beyond our 'jobs'. Even if it's not to take on the task of improving a nation, at the very least we can begin and continue to be an audience that demands films out of the ordinary - be they good, bad, or ugly - Peepli [Live]is all three, not in quality but because of its gritty content.

But, I'll go with just silly. Plain silly. ","Are the makers of Phantom trying to  imply that if we bring enough style to our solution to world terror problems, someone with real authority will take notice? Then all they have to do is follow the film's plan.  Oh but wait, except that the terrorists have seen the film. That shouldn't be a problem though, right? I am sure the writers can come up with simplistic plans like these in a jiffy. In my mind a thriller engages you completely for every minute of the film. Certainly not one that makes you go, “Hey wait, why is London's local news playing on Indian televisions?” or “They have gone so out of the way to make Katrina Kaif's hair look disheveled.” The reason you don't want to blink your eyes shouldn't be that you don't want to miss her losing her doll-face expression, just in case. Speaking of delight in disorder, our man, Saif Ali Khan, just doesn't lose or loosen his swag. Be it prison-wear or Pathani, every thing looks designer because of the way he carries it. But then again, so doesn't Bond, right? So, clearly we are going for the thriller angle more than the issue at hand – revenge for 26/11. I found the issue belittled in more ways than one. I understand that having a very close attachment to the event would have been cliché for  Nawaaz (Katrina Kaif). But her connection with the event seemed a little too much like a “first world problem”, like her favorite shopping place was bombed. How are you supposed to feel sorry for her? Her concern with Daniyal's (Saif Ali Khan) mission too seemed flippant, “oh you are killing Headley? Pretty neat!”So, all I have to bank on to get myself involved with events is my personal angst at the real-life terror attacks. And anyone who isn't living in comic-book fantasy is not a matter of a few different passports with a gun in hand. Sure, the “smart” ways to take down a couple of the terrorists were interesting. But, the concept is still of pure revenge - misguided too. “A story you wish were true” has to be more than a marketing tagline, right? The film, like many others, assumes that the terror will die with a few people. If only world peace were that easy. Terrorists, unfortunately, are smarter than the writers of the film.  And there are more than a handful around. Even if you let go of sanity of the bigger picture, the little things are a bother too. Facts are repeated to help you make the connect. The filmmakers must be confident that the audience is not going to pay attention because the fact was mentioned 5 minutes ago. All it does is add minutes to the film that the film doesn't need. But hey, if you don't watch the film, the extra minutes won't bother you. So, here's an idea...

Every goon in town and the politician too is chasing an American dream -that of kidnapping an American based desi for some quick ransom money. Let your imagination go berserk around this situation, Phans Gaye Re Obama offers that and more - in terms of laughs, ""eeeews"", and plain and simple ""blehs"".","Phas Gaye Re Obama absolutely delivers on the sarcastic wit that the title implies. Satire runs in every dialogue and situation of the film. Unfortunately though, alongside the smart quips is also the oh-so-unnecessary slapstick. What could have been a classy comedy becomes yet another toilet-humor fest. It is brilliant, however, that despite going the crude route every once in a while, the story doesn't shift focus from its basic plot. A slapstic comedy with focus - now isn't that a relief. In fact, there is a point in the latter half where I'm wondering how is Shastri (Rajat Kapoor) going to get out of this? I love it when the writer or director makes me think on his behalf. He has me hooked, irrespective of whether or not I'm enjoying his film. Of course, a film like this wouldn't achieve half of what it aims to if the actors aren't capable of getting their timing right. Here, Sanjay Mishra, and the actor who plays Anni (Manu Rishi?) are just brilliant. Who would've thought that a movie would stand tall on their shoulders? That too, with Rajat Kapoor and Neha Dhupia around, in terms of ""star-value"". Both of them have forced dialogue delivery and Neha Dhupia's character is too stylized. Also, the feminism her character portrays is tasteless. Yet, a person who enjoys slapstick is certainly going to enjoy Phas Gaye Re Obama much more than I did. So, a light, Sunday afternoon watch it is.

","Films like Phata Poster Nikla Hero make me wonder about the larger purpose. What drove the makers to make this film? So, here we have the theme of a wannabe actor landing himself in situations which force him to become a real life hero. Squeezed in you have a mother's aspirations for her son. All of this is made out to be silly, just in case you take any of this seriously. But, then the laughs drain out because of repetitions and/or labored explanations. The story knows not where to stop and you are running around in circles much like the characters in supposedly comic climax fight sequence.Andaz Apna Apna had an elaborate and absolutely hilarious last fight sequence - purely because it was silly beyond comprehension. Phata Poster Nikla Hero seemed to be gearing up to something similar. Unfortunately, it wasn't even close. Also, the sensibilities have changed since the 90s too. Which pretty much can be said of all of Phata Poster Nikla Hero.From the texture of the film to characters like the righteous mother - the film has a very dated feel about it. As if the makers were relishing nostalgia, rather than make a fresh film. The only thing fresh about the film is Shahid Kapoor's performance. Yes, the role and the film's genre require him to be loud and so he is. Yet, there is a certain composure about his performance within the context of his character. He over-acts and yet there is some constraint to not get annoying. Ileana D'Cruz on the other hand irritates soon enough, especially at places where she is required to pause between words for effect. The timing is all wrong. Though its cute to see Padmini Kolhapure back, her performance is as theatrical as it ever was. Darshan Jariwala, Zakir Hussain, Sudhir Mishra all go about their dos like they would in any third film that they do. I must say though, there are times when you can't help but laugh at the silliness on screen. Much like Andaz Apna Apna - despite the annoying self-referencing jokes strewn across the film. But, of course, these times are few and far between. Less often than the completely out-of-context songs that are picturised in a completely different tone to make the misfit even worse.In general, I find silly comedy cumboresome. Even Andaz Apna Apna, arguably the silliest of them all took its time to grow on me. At least, it went all out there. Phata Poster Nikla Hero seems like the writers lost steam within 30 minutes of run-time. How are we supposed to hold up for another two hours?

It's taxing when everything you have to say about a film is bad. It's not scary, it's not thrilling. It beats its own purpose and is just bad. I'd like to just say, ""switch channels if it's on cable!"" and get away with it. But, oh well...","A medium - the person used by the paranormal to communicate - is trying to convince a doctor that she can use her mystical powers to find his missing wife. He tells her that makes no sense. She says, ""Do you want logic or wife?"" And that pretty much sums up what the writer wants to tell us, ""Do you want logic or movie?"" For example, this medium person can sense stuff by touching people on TV screens but not sense a walking-talking spirit. The proceedings are slow, the acting is bad. Everytime Adah Sharma said, ""I am a medium."" I felt like saying out loud, ""well, you look like a large."" Yep, that bad! And it's sad because one scene Adah Sharma had in 1920 is etched in my memory for the way it spooked me. But here, nothing is spooking or even remotely thrilling. The attempt at creating mystery with all the non-linear back and forth was unnecessary and rather amusing after a point, unintentionally of course. The background score is noisy. In ""tense"" situations, there was this weird competition between tamsoma sadgamaya and loud Bollywoody-hip-hop music that said ""maahi ve"", no less! I am no filmmaker, neither do I aspire to be, but I really want to understand the psyche behind this decision. But then, I'd want to understand why this film was made in the first place. If it were to make us aware of the power of the supernatural, it defies its purpose. The supernatural was warning against all the wrong things, all through the film. Unfortunately, the production values of the film are so bad that you cannot even have fun laughing at the film. It's not like we haven't seen worse but it surely is one of those that you should make a point to save yourself from.

Others  l-l-l-i-i-i-i-n-n-g-e-r in a way you wish it stops before you can say asap. Unfortunately, Phillauri is the latter.","It is sad enough when you watch a feature length film and you don't see a story. Phillauri attempts two stories and neither has the strength of holding up by itself or to support the other.  It is more upsetting than having watched two films without a story. Sure, the special effects are reasonably better than what we are used to in an average Hindi film that involves special effects.  The story concept as brought out by the trailer is cute too. Alas, there is nothing more to go on. The cuteness or the humor seen in the trailer is pretty much all there is in the film. The few minutes before and after the said scene are just an unhealthy hyper-extention of the moment. This can be said pretty much about the entire film. I don't think I would be exaggerating if a scene where a couple hugs runs for about 5 minutes – Disney fairytale like score running in the background. This is true of the songs too. While the music is appropriately folklore-ish, the songs feel too long too.When you are only waiting for this scene to be done with, so that the next can come and be done with, you can barely be taken over by performances. All the cast does what it has to do – Suraj Sharma stays confused, Mehreen Pirzada disappointed, Diljit Dosanjh smitten. Anushka Sharma's Sashi is the only character that can afford some variation in expression and she makes the most of it. Along similar lines, when the story doesn't move, social messages, satire, strong women, etc just don't seal the deal. A story has to grip with its content or its presentation for any of this to matter. As you watch scene after scene overstay their welcome, you ultimately realise that nothing interesting is really going to happen. By the time, the big reveal(s) come about, you have guessed them and even as you guess, you aren't really enamored by any of it. Movies like Phillauri make me wonder about talented actors, producers with a said vision, music, special effects – some bits underdone, some overdone and some like story – not done at all. And how not all departments put together can compensate for the one that is way off the mark.

And does it so well. ","It is so, so rare for a film, a Hindi one at that, to treat a mental illness with such respect.  For that alone, I can give Phobia's entire team a truck load of flying kisses. I am sure, mental health practitioners will have many a bone – small and big – to pick. But, when was the last you sympathized with a mentally ill character, let alone empathize too!You feel Mehak's dread, her fear seems real and whoever doesn't understand it seems like a villain. Every time you feel like the creep has gone on for too long, you shudder at what it must be to live with it day in and day out. It is a real thing, such fear, even if it is not necessarily in this exact form. Of course, Phobia could have been miserable to sit through (in the wrong way) if it were not for Radhika Apte. One of the main things that get annoying for me in this genre are wide-eyed fear. Radhika Apte's eyes work here, though.  They go with the rest of her completely freaked out body language. So over-powering is her performance and screen presence that the rest of the main cast is completely over-shadowed despite good acts. The side characters are caricaturish and try to add a quirk to the film that goes against the film.This probably stemmed from the makers' own fear that they would bore their audience with prolonged show of fear. In a similar vein, that could also be why they added elements extraneous to the fear, like the narrative style. It is understandable, even if it didn't work for me. Interestingly enough, things that did work for me too were a little extraneous. Like the feminist angle caught me off guard and brought a smile. However, it didn't fit in with the otherwise spooky narrative. Even so, I lean towards give this one a once over at least. Especially, to sensitize yourself to the world of someone who makes up a world of their own – quite out of their control.

Ok, not 100% comedies because there are 2 strong serious scenes which put a plug on the most natural sounding laughter track playing in the audience","So, Ram Gopal Varma wanted to scare and make us question our beliefs. Well neither happened. What did happen though was discovery of RGV, the deliverer of a 1000 laughs. Ok, we are fair around here - about 700 hundred of those cackles came in the first half. The rest were interspersed between a couple very strong scenes post-interval.Just in case you haven’t guessed yet, there’s nothing remotely scary about Phoonk. Unless of course, ogling crows, out-of-focus soft toys and wooden artifacts getting predictably into the limelight give you jitters. Then there’s the heavily made-up Ashwini Kalsekar who has a fetish for charcoaled eyes. Unfortunately, even the 45 degree tilt in her head doesn’t manage to evoke the fear factor. The spooky background music might have succeeded in some kind of horror, had it been used a little less than the entire 120 minute run-time. The entire duration is also a mechanical collage of one event following the other. The individual scenes too are a collection of random shots cut and pasted together. Had there been even an average amount of flow, maybe the plot and sub-plots thereof would have been coherent enough to touch my belief system. Yeah too many ifs and buts. But it was possible. Because, being a non-superstitious person, I had completely surrendered myself to a movie about black magic. Without such submission there was no hope of enjoying this one. But, that didn’t work either. Baby Ahsaas’ act though, is really moving. She has very clearly exhausted herself in exhibiting what her character went through, and done really well too. My heart went out as much to her character as to the child artiste herself. On humanitarian grounds, is it really fair to have a 10-11 year old child go through the enactment of such torture? It’s the same question I had when I saw The Sixth Sense. It’s truly not the question of whether or not one believes in the premise of black magic. It’s how believably it’s put forth. Such an issue should have ideally made me think of how I’d react if something like this happened in my family. But, as audience I’m kept at such a distance from the procedures that it’s almost as if the makers don’t want to get me involved. Employing the standard techniques used for the horror genre neither terrified me nor made me think about the topic at hand. * * *Ps. Yay! I actually managed this one without mentioning Aag. Damn it!

Because I actually jittered and for once, could identify with the nervous laughter and shrieks from the audience. Yet, loose writing doesn't make it a satisfying horror.","I don't remember the last time I walked out of a theater and felt like I've left a different world behind. Not a world that I want to go back into any time soon, but that's not because of the quality of what I saw in there, it's the shocked and the fright my insides felt. It might have accentuated because somewhere, deep down I was expecting to watch an unintentional comedy. To my credit it was absolutely justified. But this one turned out to be a chiller. So, what if there was zero-thought in its story. Oh, by the way, the film is not directed by Ram Gopal Varma. Just saying.Phoonk 2 creates a lot of shrieks, if not out loud from the audience, at least a jerk or a shudder every once in a while. And this is all on the basis of the camerawork, sound design (though almost always, it's on the louder side), make-up and taking the suspense to an almost intolerable high. Though in a large chunk of the first half, the thrill peaks got very annoying. Later, as you get used to it and the movie moves forward inch by inch you get sucked into the drama. The writing, characterisations, and worse of all - continuity are all way beyond comprehension. The first half is used to establish that each of the characters is scared to the last nerve by an unknown and they sense something spooky doing the rounds. The second half has all these characters either getting beaten up or killed brutally by this unknown. Yes, it scares you. Not because you care for the protagonist and his family. But more because the unknown creates a completely suffocating environment. And maybe that is the film's success. But there are way too many things left loose. And here I'm not complaining about stuff that remains unexplained. I didn't let the 'why's bother me. For example, I very forcefully ignored the omnipresent, evil spirit's graciousness in allowing characters to mourn the dead for the longest time. It's the 'how's  that became too distracting. Like, can the said unknown scary unknown, with the said powers be at the same place twice? There are jerks in continuity like day turning into night and vice versa with no logical flow. And I'm one of those who didn't have a problem with the dark climax. In fact, it was very Harry Potterish. Of course, the movie wouldn't have had half the impact had the performances not been to the mark. Except for the overacting exorcists, the rest of the cast did a decent enough job of getting scared and thus scaring us. A lot of what worked for the film is because of the make-up department and the cinematographer doing an awesome job. Phoonk 2 had me in a 'job to get done' mode before it started. That turned into cynicism, in the first half hour, with every scene that moved slowly with music reaching its climax every five minutes. And absolutely unexpectedly, it started creating jitters. And that kind of anxiety doesn't give me a kick, which is why horror is by far my least-liked genre. Even so, usually super-natural horror stories don't scare me easily. This one did. I wanted the spirit to go away, because at some level I could identify with the family it was causing such agony to. If you really like that kind of horror, you could go for it. I doubt a DVD watch will do justice to the cinematography. If like me, getting terrorized - by the dead or alive - is not your idea of cinema, the IPL is still on, not only on the sports channels but on the news channels too!

213,913,913,913,913,Phuntroo,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/phuntroo-review/,,,,4.5,"Technological frills fade away in absence of empathy, and you’re left scratching your head. ","As the first frame switches from a cinematically-lit, colonial structure – amidst some strange lightening and intense score – to an old person in a conventionally-lit office-cum-library - to a few youngsters giggling at a wayside paan-bidi shop, backdrop stays unspecified, dialogue becomes uninteresting, humour sounds unpleasant. But, you do sense the eccentricity under the skin. It conveniently drives Phuntroo all along, taking care of irrational motivations for characters and their deeds.Eccentricity, comes with benefits and failings over here. Chuckles erupt for a good number of times, whereas emotional attachment remains at the bay. A minute or two into the film, as you start distinguishing between who’s who and what’s what, you get a tinge of a rainy, smoky, slow-mo, love-triangle-ish moment. In a way, it’s the crux of the film. A standard situation though it maybe, it lays out emotional turmoil, ups and downs, motivations and so on. Well thought. But hold on, subsequent scenes unfold an underlying catch. Vivid images do try to allure you, but do not essentially involve you emotionally. You just watch without being hit at your emotional core. Sensing affection, attachment or empathy here is like finding water in barren lands. And mind you, I would not be overstating if I say that this flick has zero sentiments. Don’t remember if this film opens up with a disclaimer to stay “detached”.The old structure is an engineering college as you soon figure out. It appears expansive structurally. As far as its magnitude goes, an annual gadget contest would assert a word or two. While a single student appears to be competing; others are presumed to be preparing for the contest too. You see love equations more closely, though not explicitly. Quirkiness is at its best when nothing seems to be going right for the protagonist. But just before his heartbreak, he comes across a secret project entitled Phuntroo (a mechanical slang) absolutely out of nowhere. After this pure case of writing laziness, he assumes the mission in order to fulfil his greed and desires.Surely enough, regional slangs, if put well, throw an unbeatable depth of character and humour into situations. But in a film like this, slang becomes pointless and after a point is quite puzzling. Supposed adult talks or acts, for that matter, fall flat. Dialogue, on the other hand, creates a contrasting picture. At times, they are intelligent. They swing into the moods of characters and their milieu. Others, however, are lame and unwanted beyond a doubt. The underlying theme of Phuntroo is metaphorical. It tries to explore conflicting relationship between humans and technology. It questions the existence of mechanical love. From human greed to our imminent future, it has got so much to speak about. But as regretful as it could get, the whole subtext comes as superficial and ends up being nothing. Moralising the way we love, just doesn’t work.One of the high points of the film (incidentally, also its lowest) is detail in production. It is designed is so meticulous that lots of factors feel staged, pretentious, and a sham. You could blame the lackadaisical narrative, but my focus refused to shift from technical showiness.For an industry where mainstream films are still made on minuscule budgets and new genres (or subjects) remain untouched for fear of lack in cash flow, Phuntroo could be a sign of hope. But it leaves questions unanswered. Do we need better stories? Do we need better ways to tell those stories? Do we need new genres under the pretext of being radical? Or do we still prefer our usual mediocrity? It’s high time we ask ourselves such questions. Your answers, perhaps, would echo your views about our films, including this one.

And therein is its beauty. A simple, charming film despite its toilet humor and a couple other quibbles. ","Piku and her father, Bhaskor make for a dysfunctional family that is as normal as it gets or a normal family that is as dysfunctional as one comes. You know some uncle or grandpa who is mighty difficult to live with and yet is adorable to an outsider. She's hot-headed, an angry young woman in her own right but is also a nurturer and a care-taker you feel sorry for. Piku, the film though is beyond these characters. It takes on difficult themes that are abundant in real life but rarely touched on reel. And that is what makes the film endearing despite a couple things that make you cringe and a couple other that seem like creases on an otherwise smooth texture.The all-encompassing theme of course, is that of role-reversal between a parent and a child as age takes its toll. Not only do the nurturer and recipient exchange places, but also the person saying “NO!” to things that the other would want to do has subtly traded voice. This comes a little late in the film. But as you notice that happening you want Piku to allow Bhaskor to live his life. You want to tell her that is the only way he will find release (pun intended) from his constant bickering and obsessing. Our man not only obsesses about his motions (as you know from the trailer) but is also constantly seeking attention under the garb of hypochondria. He is possessive about his daughter too and you can't miss that slight tinge of fear – fear of being alone. Fear that the child will not fulfill her duty of caring for him as he did for her. He lets out his insecurity too, but not without emotional blackmail. All trademarks of a parent, and dare I say, an Indian parent. At the same time, he is far from being a traditional parent. He will condemn a woman like an average Indian man of that age. But unlike most men I know from that age group, it is because she choses to stay at home and be dependent on the husband. Quite a contradiction from what he expects from his daughter - a beautiful contradiction because that is not a man-woman thing, it is a parent-child, a more human nature thing. These subtleties in writing are hard to find in films across the world, let alone mainstream cinema with star power that this one has. And this comes from a first viewing where I've barely overcome the awesome performances and witty dialogue. I also spent a huge portion of the first half trying to get over the constant shouting matches on, on screen. Like I would in real life, I felt like saying, “could you turn it down a notch, people?” And guess what, go to a restaurant or a theater – people are loud – even when they are having fun, and of course when they are arguing. But hey, if its Amitabh Bachchan shouting, it must be for a reason, right? His character, Bhaskor is such. He is argumentative and adamant. He is the kind of old man that will make you shout, “CUT IT OFF!” Yet, he is as non-standard a dad as it gets. In the larger, more philosophical, attitude towards life kind-of-a-way you are waiting to find something that will make you identify him with some old man you know if not your dad. Because this man has a liberal attitude towards sex; sounds perfectly sane for his age, when he talks about his dislike for women who don't have their personal ambitions . There comes the beauty of contradictions again. The characters that make Piku, the film so real. Piku, the character on the other hand is easier to identify with. Torn between her career and her familial responsibilities, she hold her own. You wonder how she doesn't lose her temper more often with her father. The impatience seems a little unlikely. Only to realise that she has found outlets in the world outside. She is angry with the world. She is liberal, has a liberal environment but is she liberated?Rana, their unlikely thus forced companion brings in the balance to the equation. It's not like he doesn't involve himself in the banter, but there is a calmness about his persona - an acceptance, if not resignation, for that thing called life. Having written so far, I haven't even felt like talking about the performances. If that is not a compliment to the actors in itself, then let me verbalise it. I'm finding it practically impossible to separate the actor from the character. Does it matter then, that Amitabh Bachchan's Bengali accent doesn't seem consistent. You aren't surprised one bit that Bhaskor is the kind of man who'd want the last word and the second-last one too in every single conversation he has. But it doesn't feel consistent that he does go mum when he is offered a new remedy for constipation. That he listens to with rapt attention. The other couple times you catch him going quiet are when a character has behaved contrary to what he had judged him as. He is surprised to not have seen that streak. And boy am I in love with these actresses who started out as pretty props but now wear their makeup-less, more girl-next-door look on their sleeves? Be it Kangna Ranaut in Queen or Deepika Padukone here. She sounds shrill when she is in a quarrel with a cab driver, but that's what the girl-next-door who shouts at a cab driver would sound like. About Irrfan Khan, I think I am soon going to stop writing about his performances. They are so enamouring  that I find myself repetitive. It is amazing how he can make any character wear his deadpan look and dry humor as if it were his own. A rare case of the actor bringing a part of him to the character and getting away with it. The actors in smaller roles too have wonderful quirks as characters to make them memorable. Be it Moushumi Chatterjee as the blunt aunt or Jisshu Sengupta as the coy boy or Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury as a reminder of kaka from a Hrishikesh Mukherjee film – be it Anand or Chupke Chupke.With all this going for Piku, it is a shame then, that I found myself liking the film more while writing about it than while watching it. The simplicity of the plot and the Bengali does make you think of Hrishikesh Mukherjee and that is as good as it gets, right? But, you stop short as soon as you see a product placement and then another. They just make you cringe. Then you start noticing more things you don't like. For example, some of the outbursts seem abrupt and more for the sake of convenience. For a movie about relationships, scenes that linger between two people rather than one scene after another. And of course, for a person as averse to toilet humor as I am, a film which has poop as a character by itself, is a little hard to digest. Yes, yes, even if it is Amitabh Bachchan's. See what Piku just did there? It made me incorporate my own version of toilet humor in the review. That is its charm.Piku leaves ample scope for stereotyping Bengalis but I'll resist the temptation to go in that direction. I will say though that their “roshogulla-ness” is taken in perfectly even when they are being nasty and well – passing of motions as emotions.

215,915,915,915,915,Pink,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma reviewPreview31 Critic Reviews 4.7/5.0 4 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/pink-review/,4.7/5.0,5/5.0,,4.833333333,"You forget you are watching a film for a lot of the 2+ hours. Doesn't wrench your heart or gut, but works on the mind. Hopefully. ","Pink isn't really a fictional film, is it? It might as well have been a documentary. In fact, a lot of the screenplay, must read like one. A very engrossing documentary, though. One that from the word go makes you identify with it. However, every once in a while it reminds itself that it is a movie, as if it were mandatory - by use of a song or a  break from the drama. Pink is so close to home that only a few of those digressions bother you. As a middle-aged, urban woman with two teenage kids, one of whom is a girl – the questions Pink raises are something I struggle with on an almost day-to-day basis.  As a middle-aged, urban woman who likes to meet new people, I have often had to think about what my actions must be construed as by the people around me. I cannot even imagine what it must be like for a young girl who lives by herself. This identification has been used to Pink's advantage. Well, for starters, you smirk at the sarcasm in its title. To make the point it wants to, it's important that the audience feel like it could happen to them any day. As it very well might. However, it still doesn't hit the gut. There is just the one scene that makes you squirm. I would think that would be the root of the courtroom drama. But the rest of the film, barely mentions it. It nagged me through the film. But, as an afterthought, might as well. If a relatively less serious offense can be brought to attention. The more serious one is taken care of by itself. Nip it in the bud, so to speak. However, when I say that, I go out on a limb here. Because as a psychiatrist friend once told me, it doesn't matter whether it was “actual” rape or not. The only thing that matters is the violation that the victim feels.Apologies, I digress again. I like films that make me digress in this manner. They have to be well-written and well-performed for it to be so effective. The girls all play the bits well enough for us to worry about them. The guys make you want to hold them by the collar and punch their eye. If anyone, the prosecutor, played by Piyush Mishra comes across like a caricature; his act a bit over-done.In Amitabh Bachchan films, I always admire how you tend to forget the actor and remember the character he played, especially while you are watching the film. Here I was slightly worried that the film might become about this mentally deteriorating lawyer. But, the film is only and only about the issue. The lawyer, the victims, the culprits serve only one purpose – to bring the issue forth.And of course there is a sermon. It is broken into pieces and is not one long lecture. But it is a speech nevertheless. That Amitabh Bachchan is delivering it, makes you listen to it with rapt attention. That it is about a topic that means something to you, helps you too. But hey, it is a sermon nevertheless. And my problem with them is that they jolt you out of the story making you realise again that it is a film you are watching. Equally jarring is the song that abruptly begins in the background. Also, a little less of the setup and a little more of the courtroom drama would have worked better. Even so, when it is time, as a parent of a girl, I would want her to watch this film. I believe, I don't have to teach her, her rights. But, just to be sure, maybe I should. As a parent of a boy, I would want him to watch this film. I believe, I don't have to teach him physical boundaries and the meaning of consent. But, just to be sure, maybe I should. And if the lad has to get a sermon, why not from the man himself, why not through a story with characters to hate and root for, why not through a display of emotions very real. Yeah, yeah, yeah, trust a parent to turn a film into education. But, did I not mention, Pink might as well have been a dramatic documentary? A good one, at that.

216,916,916,916,916,[The] Pink Panther 2,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma reviewNotepad,/movie/the-pink-panther-2-review/,,,,4.833333333,Steve Martin reprises the role of Inspector Clouseau and it is a debacle all the way.,"Steve Martin is back again as Inspector Jacques Clouseau in the Pink Panther 2, in what seems to be a really ridiculous attempt to keep the franchise going.  Right at the onset, I must confess that I am not a great fan of Steve Martin.
Yes, I have seen some of his films; Sgt Bilko, The Father of the Bride are the names that come to mind.  I have also seen Planes, Trains, and Automobiles as well as Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.  As films I enjoyed the last two more, primarily because you had John Candy and Michael Caine respectively, acting in them.  But Steve Martin had never really left an impression on me with respect to his comic abilities.  The role of the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau was initially played by the great comic genius, Peter Sellers, in five films, all directed by Blake Edwards.  Some of the films were really funny, with Sellers in great form, as the French Detective.  So it was very difficult to watch Steve Martin enact the character and not compare it with Seller’s version, even though one knows that comparisons might prove to be inherently unfair.
(I believe that Steve Martin has been crying himself hoarse saying that he has not played Clouseau as Sellers would have done, but instead interpreted it differently).The plot is shopworn and is a reworking of the earlier Pink Panther films.  The supporting cast are all fine actors with the likes of Andy Garcia, Alfredo Molina, Lily Tomlin, Jean Reno, and heaven help us, Jeremy Irons.  They have absolutely nothing to do in the film except look foolish and irritated at alternate intervals.  Yes, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is there too, as Sonia, but she is mainly kept in the background.  John Cleese plays Dreyfuss, Clouseau’s boss (a role made famous by Herbert Lom in the original Pink Panther films) and he is completely wasted too.  The screenplay really lets the film down; it is extremely predictable and seems to consist only of the gags.  When it tries to do other things, it ends up creating the character of Mrs. Berenger (played by Lily Tomlin) who tries to teach Clouseau political correctness.  This could have been the basis of a whole set of witty dialogues / situations parodying today’s world, but no, what we get instead are very banal and boring situations.  Steve Martin struts around through a series of set piece slapstick gags, but the gags are flat and insipid.  There is not a single gag that makes you laugh hilariously; you have Martin as the Pope, you have Martin choosing wine, you have Martin investigating a large mansion, you have Martin as a flamenco dancer, and you have Martin practicing karate with his side kick’s children (another reworking from the original Peter Seller’s films), but it all comes across as extremely labored.  The most irritating thing about Martin is his accent; with Sellers, the faux French accent was hilarious, with Martin it is the equivalent of a red, itchy rash that one would like to get rid of post haste.  Martin maintains an immobile visage, his face frozen into something between a pout and a sneeze.  The climax is as hackneyed as the rest of the movie, with Martin jumping and dodging various objects.  Slapstick routines require terrific physicality as in a Buster Keaton or a Charlie Chaplin; Martin unfortunately just does not have it.  He also does not have the superb timing, the confidence, and the varied body language that Peter Sellers' Clouseau had; neither is Martin a master of disguise.  Martin comes across as a total chump busy clowning around desperately in order to attract attention. (Or is that his interpretation of Clouseau?)  The film is a total bummer; the only sounds of laughter were from a bunch of ten year olds in the theatre. I would like to think that they laughed the loudest when Martin was getting the worst of it.  Need anything more be said?PS It was a pleasure to hear the theme music again: the only saving grace of the film is the excellent background score by Christophe Beck.

217,917,917,917,917,[The] Place Beyond the Pines,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/place-beyond-pines-review/,,,,4.833333333,"Similar in mood and characters to his previous film Blue Valentine but starkly different in terms of what he’s trying to say, director Derek Cianfrance’s The Place Beyond the Pines is a complex film, not in terms of comprehending what’s going on, but in terms of coming to terms with it. This is a film I’d quite recommend to those who love it when cinema leads to soul-searching.","A little over two years after the poetic Blue Valentine, the Derek Cianfrance-Ryan Gosling combo is back with The Place Beyond the Pines, a film that has so much going for it and yet seems to have something missing; something you can’t pinpoint for sure, but you can almost feel it while watching the film. If I had to try my best to describe what’s missing, I’d say, “A destination.” That can be both, a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how you look at it. I’ve always disliked it when someone, after they know I’ve watched a particular film, asks me, “So what is the film about?” I hate attempting to distill an entire film into a few lines of prose. But with this particular film, I wouldn’t be able to even if I tried. The Place Beyond the Pines talks about characters, about choices and about consequences. It deals with loneliness, with morality, with responsibility and with survival instincts. Not out of laziness, but for the purpose of illustrating something, I’m reproducing the official synopsis of the film below. “A motorcycle stunt rider turns to robbing banks as a way to provide for his lover and their newborn child, a decision that puts him on a collision course with an ambitious rookie cop navigating a department ruled by a corrupt detective.” That, dear reader, is precisely what the film is not about. Ryan Gosling’s motorcycle stunt rider and Bradley Cooper’s rookie cop are mere eyewashes; quite like Blue Valentine, this film too is set around men who are failures, even if some of them seem to don the garb of being successful. In fact, Derek Cianfrance seems to have made it a pattern. The men in his films always seem to be talented people who are perpetual underachievers, no matter how hard they try. The women, on the other hand, seem have to deal with the grotesqueries of their respective men’s personalities. The film also subtly shows the butterfly effect; the consequences to one’s actions, that are often so far-reaching in time and space, that you can only truly know it when you are watching it from the outside; if you are a viewer at the cinema, or if you are God. What defines right and wrong? Does one right undo a wrong that has been done? No? Then do two rights undo one wrong? No? Then how many rights does it take? Who defines it? The world is an orgy of shades of grey, and cinema very rarely tries to explore that. Even the films that do portray grey characters often do it at a superficial level – they’ll show a backstory of a man seeking redemption for some aspect of his personality, ultimately coming up trumps in the end.Cianfrance fastidiously avoids black and white, with every single character that appears before you. They’ve all got chinks in their personality, and none of them ever venture too much out of the grey spectrum. And every single character in the film, no matter how big or small, is a loner. In fact, the sense of loneliness hangs through the film.The terrific cast, especially Gosling and Cooper, play out the melancholy quite well. Gosling’s character does seem like a cocktail of some of his previous characters, particularly the ones from Drive and Blue Valentine, but he always seems to add in that little bit extra in his voice and body language, which makes him so great in every role that he plays. Bradley Cooper’s character, now that I think of it, also seems to be a mix of his characters from Limitless and Silver Linings Playbook, except that he actually manages to seem like an uncomfortable young rookie when he has to. Also, his character has the widest, steepest graph in the film, and he pulls it off.The talented Ben Mendelsohn, again, plays a character that reminds you of him in Andrew Dominik’s Killing Them Softly, but he is excellent as always. Eva Mendes looks appropriately haggard, in keeping with her character. I’ve never been a fan of her acting prowess. Here too, she’s good, but never great. Ray Liotta is superb, subtly menacing, in a tiny role.When I left the theatre after the film, I couldn’t believe just how much the film had traversed in its runtime. It meandered often, and some of the situations were downright implausible. Still, because of the sheer pertinence and relevance of the some of the questions that the film raises, it is bound to gnaw away at you even hours after you’ve watched it. Then, there are some beautiful frames that say so much; ones that will stay with you for a while. The Place Beyond the Pines is the kind of film that will reward you for your patience, but it’ll take some time to realize that what you got in return was actually a reward.

218,918,918,918,918,Players,Watch when on TV/online,wogma reviewNotepadPreview40 Critic Reviews 0.9/5.0 3 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/players-review/,0.9/5.0,3/5.0,,4.35,A bunch of non-actors pull off heists in the remake of The Italian Job. And there are new twists of course! It's an Abbas-Mustan film after all! And yet it is not as bad as the promos look. ,"Is Players, The Italian Job? It is. But, it is not. Then it is. And then again, it is not. Because, after all, it is an Abbas-Mustan product. The twists and turns turning into more turns and twists is a given. The lawn tennis that the characters play with their loyalties is also expected. You wonder whether the makers are screening a joke on themselves as the good thief and bad thief mock each other for being predictable. So what if we might not be able to make out which one of the four characters is the mole? We know one of them ought to be, and that is predictable enough, dear directors.So, there is no sitting on the edge of your seat business. There is no thrilling chase that has you wrapped around itself. But, I must admit, that some of the twists made the plot a little more interesting, even if it was only for a few minutes. Players is also a lot less dramatized than I anticipated. And it is, thankfully, less stylized than the trailers made it out to be. But, that isn't saying too much, is it? I expected it to ooze substance-free form in every frame. So, it's not like you are going to miss the slo-mos nor is there a dearth of pauses after every third word for dramatic effect. And since that's pretty much intentional, what chance do our actors have to give a decent performance? Not that we have too much hope left from this set of actors. A quick reminder - Abhishek Bachchan, Bipasha Basu, Sonam Kapoor, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Bobby Deol, Sikander Kher. It is a shame that I have not a good word to say about even Bachchan Jr. The rest are aging only worse with every film. And boy, did they over-estimate Neil Nitin Mukesh's potential to deliver a non-standard role. The only reasonable actor in this ensemble is Omi Viadya who is comic-relief incarnate. A couple of one-liners have brilliant timing, and that's all it takes to remember him. The whole theater laughed out loud at a joke which has been done to death on sms/facebook/what-have-you! That's how remarkable Omi is. But, like any other Abbas-Mustan film, you are guaranteed some exotic locales that are shot beautifully. A slick movie, Players surely is. In fact, they've chosen not so often visited Russia and New Zealand, and have gone as close to the North Pole as a film crew can go too. The sound also contributes in making you feel like you are a part of the action. There were a number of scenes where you can feel your seat pulsing with the beat. Yet, Hindi action thrillers are miles away from their Hollywood counterparts, despite having smart action and camera work. They lack originality. They remain just that - remakes of other films. The problem also is the directors' strong belief in adding masala to suit the Indian palate. I don't get the insistence on adding song and dance, lackluster at that! Nor do I understand the rationale behind going out of the way to include comedy amidst tense drama. Just because it makes me laugh, it doesn't stop it from becoming a distraction from the flow of the story or a particular scene. And it only adds fidgety minutes to the run-time. 
One of the things that I like about The Italian Job is that it makes a team out of strangers because they have a common enemy. And fortunately, Players doesn't lose that flavor. Alongside there is a tidbit of romantic undercurrent. It's a good thing that it is kept in its place and there isn't much ado about it. Abbas-Mustan, of course, also add the extra load of twists. Only this time around there is a relatively better attempt at tying loose ends. Players might work a slight shade better only because the expectations from it are so low. Watchable not must watch, like many other films running on TV.

219,919,919,919,919,Playing for Keeps,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review,/movie/playing-for-keeps-review/,,,,4.35,"A film that falls halfway between a romantic comedy and an emotional drama, it fails miserably at being either. Save for Gerard Butler’s accent, there is nothing about Playing For Keeps that is remotely memorable. This film is terribly disappointing, considering that it is directed by the director of The Pursuit of Happyness and because it has cast with stellar names that are completely wasted.","Perhaps the biggest disappointment about Playing For Keeps is the fact that it comes from Gabriele Muccino, the director of that little gem of a film, The Pursuit of Happyness. The former isn’t a patch on the latter, in spite of the fact that the two films seemingly have the same emotional core – a coming-of-age father-son story.George Dryer is an erstwhile football star, now on hard days. He’s moved to Virginia to be closer to his little son, who lives with his mother; Dryer and she are divorced. Aspiring to be a sports anchor, he spends his time making audition tapes of himself, selling his old football memorabilia to raise cash. He eventually takes up a position as the coach of a school football team, where his son plays. Amidst attractive, needy soccer moms vying for his attention, Dryer sets about trying to ‘grow up’.The film struggles to establish just what it is trying to be. Is it supposed to be purely an emotional story? If so, then there are too many subplots and attempts at comedy for it to make even a minor dent on the viewer’s heart. Is it supposed to be a comedy? If that is the case, then the film just isn’t funny, even though it tries hard to be.The film does tilt more towards being emotional and touching, as it attempts to draw the viewer in to the journey that Dryer as a character undertakes. But it just falls flat on that count. Apart from the fact that the film is just written poorly - it has no graph in its narrative and treatment – I suspect also that it largely has to do with the cast of the film, or to be more precise, the manner in which they are used.It’s strange that popular and acclaimed actors like Dennis Quaid, Uma Thurman, Catherine Zeta-Jones and the likes signed on for such thankless, pointless side characters. The characters aren’t strong enough to make the audience feel that they are companions or obstacles in Dryer’s personal journey, but yet are given enough screen time to test the audience’s patience. So much so that this 106-minute film seems far longer than it actually is.Gerard Butler as George Dryer is admittedly appealing enough; his tousled locks and charming Scottish accent at least justify why so many women go weak in the knees around him. But even his character is as poorly written as the rest, because his behaviour in the company of these women flinging themselves at him is completely out of place. Jessica Biel as his wife churns out the best performance in the film, even though I must say she didn’t particularly have a tough role to play. At various points in its runtime, the film seems more like a wasted opportunity than anything else. It has nothing to offer to the audience, save for a good-looking cast. It lacks soul; it has nothing to make the audience identify with the characters or even something to genuinely laugh at. Hard to recommend as even a DVD or TV watch, Playing For Keeps is a bland, silly film that doesn’t make a point.

Interestingly, he's part of the system too! ","I guess the only actor left to play the badass, Robinhood-cum-Krishna cop was Sanjay Dutt. With Policegiri that's done and dusted too. That should answer all your questions about being loud, full of action, predictable, etc. There are tinges of surprise with the course Sanjay Dutt's character Rudra takes in the end. Also, some of the dialogue has spark while other lines are plain lame. However Prakash Raj, as the typical, villain politician Nagori, does his bit with such conviction that you can watch more of him even though it feels like you have seen him only in this avatar. His comic timing is impeccable and so is his dialogue delivery.On the other hand, for about the first half hour of the film, Sanjay Dutt sounds like he's talking while chewing on a betel nut or a paan. After that, you get used to it. The rest of his act is pure action do. In the same vein, Prachi Desai does what a woman in an action film is supposed to do - look pretty and give the hero's conscience a nudge if and when the need arises.There are bleak hints of wisdom when Nagori refers to how difficult it is for him to cater to his ego or irony when Sanjay Dutt questions how senior officers and politicians can support someone who has been booked under a terrorist act. More comedy than irony, actually.Considering Policegiri banks heavily on its action sequences, the action, related editing and post-production work on the action are all pretty awful. In competition for being awful are the song and dance routines, including the music.So, but for the saving grace in terms Prakash Raj's performance and a few lines, Policegiri has barely anything going for it.

221,921,921,921,921,Pompeii,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/pompeii-review/,,,,3.55,"Pompeii, directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, is named after the real city that was destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. A romance set against a real life tragedy that occurred nearly two millennia ago, Pompeii remains a forgettable film despite its gigantic scale and decent visual effects; because there's nothing in it that binds you to the film. ","The real story of Pompeii is a tragic one. A thriving city under the Roman empire, progressive for its time, gutted by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, a constantly rumbling volcano that had been non-destructive for centuries till then.Director Paul W. S. Anderson, unlike his namesake (the one with that most enviable of filmographies!) is best known for camp; think Mortal Kombat or Death Race. In his hands, Pompeii, the film, becomes a VFX-heavy actioner with a love story as well as a bromance thrown in. The film isn't particularly unwatchable, but this is one of those films where you sorely miss familiar faces in the lead roles; the kind of film that needed raw star power to justify the scale it has been mounted on.The story, undoubtedly, had weight. A budding period romance with obstacles of its own, in a town at the base of a volcano that, unknown to them, is on the verge of a cataclysmic eruption. If told with a more sensitive, auteristic vision, the film had the potential to go down as an epic love story.Instead, what we get are predictable gladiator-style fight scenes, English with British and American accents in a Roman city, and a half-baked romance where you hardly ever feel a connect with the lead pair - simply because you hardly ever see them together. In fact, the lead character Milo's romance gets lesser footage than the story of his growing friendship with a fellow slave named Atticus. Such is the contrast between these two stories, that in the dying moments of the film, you root for the two men to end up alive together, irrespective of whether Milo unites with his lady love or not.All of this could still have made for some genuine big screen fun, if the film had a charismatic cast, or, at the very least, a big star essaying the role of Milo. Kit Harrington, who plays the mysterious, strong and silent Milo, just doesn't have the magnetic persona that was needed to make him a character you'd want to cheer for. The familiar faces in the cast - Kiefer Sutherland, Carrie-Anne Moss, Jared Harris - seem almost embarrassed to be there. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays Atticus with an endearing stiffness. Despite having no obvious acting skills, you root for him more than you do for Milo.To be fair, the film does have decent VFX. The long shots of Pompeii, with the imposing Vesuvius as the backdrop, look quite impressive, as does the period feel, even if its historical authenticity is quite suspect. But the action set pieces aren't particularly imaginative, and the 3D glasses darken the film a tad too much. Mercifully, the film is brisk and short, not testing your patience too much.Despite being mounted on the scale that it is, Pompeii gives a generic, been-there-seen-that feel to it, which isn't aided in any way by having no anchoring presence to carry the film through. It's the kind of film that is so hard to take seriously, even though it seems like there are people who've given it their all. It wasn't until the final shot of the film, a touching symbol of eternal love, that it struck me that there was a lot of wasted potential in the real as well as reel story of Pompeii.

222,922,922,922,922,Prague,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review11 Critic Reviews 1.1/5.0,/movie/prague-review/,1.1/5.0,,,2.566666667,"A pleasant surprise it is, though it is unfair to describe it so pleasantly, for Prague is a trippy, edgy film. ","The illusion called reality. You walk into the mind of another person and you are bound to feel disoriented. And if the mind of that person is under illusions, your can only imagine the chaos you find yourself in. This is the world Prague takes you to - the world of a young man, Chandan where he has lost capacity to tell between reality and illusion, how do you expect to get it?If only, Prague sensitizes you to the constantly shaken up feeling of a person suffering from schizophrenia. If you find it uncomfortable to watch, imagine what that person's life must be like. It is a mercy then that you know the trigger behind Chandan's hallucinations. Else, the only way to explain the workings of these illusions is chemical imbalance.Prague then is an intense, trippy snippet of Chandan's life. Played out beautifully by Chandan Roy Sanyal and his hallucinations - guilt-tripper Arfi Lamba, lover Elena Kazan and alter-ego friend Mayank Kumar. Or maybe they are real people and not his hallucinations.This constant doubt makes the film predictable in that you doubt everything you are watching and wonder if you'll ever know what the reality is. Yet, the edgy, non-linear treatment keeps you hooked. Interestingly, the non-linearity is what brings a weird sense of flow to the events. You might never find out the chronological order of events, and yet it might make sense to you because it doesn't really matter. I am instantly attracted to things that I don't understand completely. The intrigue in itself is enticing. This is where Prague scores.

223,923,923,923,923,Pratibimb,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review,/movie/pratibimb-review/,,,,2.566666667,"Those expecting Pratibimb to keep up the good work done in the recent past by Marathi filmmakers are going to be sorely disappointed. It is a confused film that is written and executed in the most amateurish manner. The film has absolutely nothing going for it, apart from the fact that it keeps the audience guessing right till the end. A few character performances are competent, but nothing that can help lift the film. The generous dose of stereotypical horror elements don’t contribute to the film in any way. Pratibimb is a film that just doesn’t need to be watched.","The growth that Marathi cinema has seen over the last few years truly warms my heart. What sets it apart is the fact that there is an inherent honesty in the cinema. Marathi films more often that not capture a certain flavor of life as a Maharashtrian – be it in a rural setting like in Deool or with an urban backdrop like in Hello Jai Hind. I feel delighted when I think of the fact that there is a new Marathi film to watch every week. This week, I had three new releases to choose from. So, when I read, ‘Pratibimb is a story that revolves around a newly married couple…’ I felt that I didn’t need to read further. I had made my choice. What followed was one of the instances in life where one needs to insert a ‘note to self’.Pratibimb turned out to be a shockingly amateurish film that was confused about what genre it wanted to belong to, what it really wanted to do to the audience, and in general, what was the point it was trying to make. Any hopes of the aforementioned honesty were dashed in the first five minutes itself, following a poorly performed and executed item song starring Sonali Kulkarni in clothes that reminded one of what Kajol wore in the first half of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, only cheaper. After the said newly married couple get newly married, the newly married wife gets the shock of her life when she discovers that her newly married husband isn’t newly married after all – he was married earlier. And what blows the wind out of her windpipe is the fact his first wife, now dead, was an exact replica of her. All of this is revealed in the first ten minutes of the film itself. What follows is a part-horror, part-crime but mostly silly story with inane twists and turns that would make Abbas and Mustan puff their chests up in pride. The film wears an extremely dated look and is very poorly cut. There were times when I was astounded over just how poor the technical aspects of the film were and how such a sub-standard product saw a release in the first place. Now I am not one to hanker over technique when there is an interesting story to tell. The main problem with this film is that the story is so ridiculous that it makes Ready look like Mughal-E-Azam. Touching upon issues like screenplay, characterization and narrative structure, then, would be akin to explaining the nuances of cricket to a Texan.To be fair, the second half of the film had me hooked. I was very eager to know exactly what the inane-ness was leading to. I was, quite literally, on the edge of my seat. A part of me, the unabashed cinema lover, was hoping that the climax of the film would make up for the preceding nonsense, that it would make me sit up straight and say, ‘You were trying to make a thriller? Well, I did get thrilled.’ Again, note to self.The climax of the film, the reason for why all of the supposed spooky-creepy stuff was happening earlier, is such an insult to one’s intelligence that all I wanted after the film was green tea and Casablanca. In other words, I really needed to flush my conscious and sub-conscious.For the actors, there is really nothing much to say. Sonali Kulkarni tries hard but fails. Ankush Choudhary is saddled with the worst role in the film, and there is a strange poetic justice in the way he performs it. Ganesh Yadav, known mainly for his character roles in a number of Hindi films based on the underworld, is competent. So is Ravindra Mankani, a fine actor. The rest of them are, well, there.Bluntly put, Pratibimb was so disappointing that it resulted in what you have read on this page so far. Go figure.

224,924,924,924,924,Pratidwandi,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/pratidwandi-review/,,5/5.0,,3.233333333,"Pratidwandi (The Adversary) is one of Satyajit Ray’s finest works and does well to chronicle the struggle of an intellectual college drop-out to find a job in Calcutta in the 1970s, even as some of his close friends surrender those ideals, ‘stop thinking and start doing’. The influence of French New Wave is apparent in this film, as are the parallels drawn to the city’s struggle under its set Leftist rule. Watch it to get up-close to the frustrations of a Bengali struggler.","The commonly believed theory that adaptations of books don’t really turn out into good films, will come in for a reality check, if we dig deeper into the sheer amount of regional literature that has successfully been adapted for screen. I’ve salivated much over Satyajit Ray’s debut film Pather Panchali (adapted from Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay’s novel). I spent last week admiring another of Ray’s gems - Pratidwandi, this one based on a novel by Sunil Ganguli.Part of Satyajit Ray’s Calcutta Trilogy - Seemabaddha (Company Limited) and Jana Aranya (The Middleman) being the other two that followed - this film is wonderful chronicle of Calcutta of the 1970s, through the eyes of an unemployed intellectual, Siddhartha (Dhritiman Chatterjee), who is a college drop-out and struggling to find a job. The film beautifully captures his frustrations, insecurities, the ideals he clings to, even as people around him seem to slowly find a footing as ‘doers, not thinkers’.Ray also shows a grasp over the changing gender equation of those times, where it was observed that qualified (and let’s say attractive) women would find a job quite easily than men. Siddhartha’s sister, Sutapa (Krishna Bose) represents that shift, and is shown not only to be earning a modest salary, but also is slated for a fat pay-hike, wants to pursue modelling and has enrolled for ballet classes. Siddhartha’s amazement at this gender shift - “Didi, you’ve changed a lot” - is well documented.Ray’s cinematic technique is one of the highlights of this film. The influence of French New Wave cinema is evident thanks to the frequent jump-cuts, stylish visual metaphors and impulsive dream sequences. All of them not add some chutzpah to the storytelling, but also put together a diverse assortment of thoughts inside Siddhartha’s brain. I especially liked the way his mind is transported to a certain Biology class, when he sees a woman crossing the street.The character of Siddhartha is essentially the soul of the film and his insecurities are such that viewers can easily relate to. His predicament of finding a job is shown to be a rather painful process. The interview screening scenes are tributes to Ermanno Olmi’s gem The Job (1961), and right from the nervous interviewee biting his fingernails, to the lack of seating arrangements, the screenplay does justice to depict the anxiety of the intellectual Bengali struggler in the 1970s. A highlight is Siddhartha’s job interview scene - his answers set the tone for what is to follow in the course of the film.I loved the way Ray has used close-ups in the film. Siddhartha’s calm plea for silence when he feels he’s being lectured at, his desire to shoot his enemy at sight, his transformation into a revolutionary in a second, his scorn for the rich and wealthy, and his disgust for foreigners high on dope, are acute observations that define his nature. These are little moments, but they add great value to character development.Siddhartha’s own search for a worthy job runs parallel to his search for a bird, from his childhood memories. The film does well to tie the two searches together, till the end.Although set in the Calcutta of the 1960s, Pratidwandi continues to be relevant considering the city’s current state of affairs. Employment is still a major issue. I can tell you from personal experience, that the quiet and composed Bengali ‘intellectual’ that Siddhartha personifies in the film, still is a topic of playful mockery and often runs the risk of sounding too frank and candid about his loyalties and preferences, when he appears for job interviews.Pratidwandi is certainly one of Ray’s best works. I’m not sure if it’s a DVD which you’ll revisit again and again, unless for academic purposes. Nevertheless, it’s a fine story about ideals being compromised under pressure from reality. Watch it not just for Satyajit Ray, but also to get an easy understanding of the mind of a struggler, stuck in a Leftist state where opportunities are few, but to embrace them, something has to give - soul, ideals or temper.

Naah, it would have been as tedious and boring.  ","A coronation set in present day India – it is fantasy world, alright. Within that framework too though, Prem Ratan Dhan Payo doesn't have an interesting tale to tell. Neither do you quite 'get' the characters' motivations nor their greivances. Also, all the extravagance you see in the trailer is all there is. The rest of the film is a visual drab too.A few situations make you feel like you are in a time-warp. Mythili, a successful entrepreneur who also runs a charitable organisation (as superficial as it might look) is suddenly demure about wearing a short dress. She seems pretty comfortable with what she wears so far in the film and carries it well too. It seems more like a Barjatya obsession. Have the lead lady become all aware and weird about a “western” dress that her man wants her to wear. The writing is too conscious of itself too – trying too hard to be a Barjatya-Salman film that has to teach you a thing or two about family values. As blasphemous as it sounds, a stranger showing up in a family to solve their internal squabbles, reminded me of Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Bawarchee. But, why set it up in a “princedom”? You lose connect immediately. If you want me to escape from my real-life problems, why would you bring up familial issues? To top it off, add TV serial style lighting, décor, costumes-jewelry and melodrama.  In the midst of this, there's one honest moment when Mythili has had enough and can't handle the strain of her relationship with the prince any more. But, other than that, there too much effort put into making us believe what the character is feeling. To blame it on the actors would be take the easy route out. Sure, Salman Khan, Sonam Kapoor, Anupam Kher, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Swara Bhaskar are all guilty of trying too hard to be what they are supposed to be rather than make their characters believable. But, they have no help from the script. The dialogue induce eyerolls. And the innuendos seemed pretty out of place. The lesser said about the screenplay, the better. Just because it is Diwali season, you have a song with mathri and chakli1 and a scene with Bhaubeej2? All too cheesy. All this serves the sole purpose of elongating the run-time of the film. More time in the theaters is a festival gift? I saw Prem Ratan Dhan Payo in a single screen theater, in a small town in Maharashtra - a theater where a house full of whistles drowned down dialogue for a good part of the first half hour. That is how excited the audience was to be there. While I wasn't too happy with the movie-watching experience, I was excited about watching the film with the target audience. In a way, it was sad to sense a lull in the crowd for most of the second half. No one should have to watch a film they didn't like on a festival day. A few people left the theater before the end too. But hey, if films which prefer so-called extravagance (with shoddy CGI) to some effort in writing are beginning to bore people, I see a silver lining.

","Premasathi Coming Suun is not a children’s film (not that it is inappropriate for them). But everything about this comedy film is so childish that even kids would laugh at it. It’s a sheer waste of money not only for its producers, but also for viewers.The film is an uninspiring rom-com of a young man, who gets married to a gorgeous woman chosen by his grandmother. This bride, however, has a hidden agenda. As the groom’s family discovers her secret subsequently, it’s you who ridicule the moment more than anyone. Nobody really cares if a film is inspired (or copied) by other films as long as it moves you or brings smiles to your face. Unfortunately; this immaturely-written, predictable film kills your excitement at every point.The prevalent issue of Premasathi Coming Suun is that it lacks sincerity. Director Ankur Kakatkar seems to be more concerned about how stunning his leading lady Neha Pendse looks. Unfortunately, it leads to lacklustre display on every front. Pathetic story, incongruous sequences, lame direction, futile production - you name it and the film has it. Regrettably, what the film doesn’t have is a single scene that can make you sympathise with the protagonists’ emotional state or hook you.Premasathi Coming Suun is another fine example of mundane films that remind you of over-exaggerated acts like in theater. In fact, this film occasionally appears to be one such play projected on celluloid. None of the actors show their true grit to at least help you tolerate this bizarre narrative. The lack of prudent writing is certainly at fault for their crippled performances. The buck stops at Kakatkar.The makers’ heavy reliance on tedious one-liners and punch lines falls flat on their faces. It is high time our filmmakers realised the seriousness of comedy. A closer look at Marathi comedies released in the recent past reveals that they all look prosaic; all thanks to worn-out, rhymed lines. I am not at all against such dialogue, but their overuse is an issue. A fresh approach on this front is a must.If all this torture wasn’t enough, out of place songs make matter worse for you. Move over Sheila and Munni, because Gulabo has come to grab all your attention. This particular song could have been easily edited out.Give this film a miss unless you want to pull your hair out.

Subtle humor to on-the-face silliness makes it easy to keep that smile on for the entire 90 minutes.,"President Bush has provided us with loads of entertainment over the last eight years. So what if they were with headshakes-in-despair.  Six Indians who represent the other billion of us wait for a handshake-in-desperation with THE man in The President is coming. It is as much a comment on our obsession as a nation with the American dream - love it or hate it - as it is about the nation who chose this man twice to lead their nation! A Math nerd, a farmer, a stockbroker, a wannabe-Paris-Hilton, an accent trainer and a leftist novelist - are all motivated to meet President Bush on his visit to India. If that wasn't diversity enough - one of them is a South Indian, one a hardcore Maratha, another a Gujrati, then a Bengali and two ""better-exposed"" city-bred youngsters. You can imagine the amount of fun this medley can cause all thanks to of course - stereotyping. And they do it largely without slapstick!! Filled to the last bit with sarcasm, The President is coming is consistent with the typecasts it initiates. It's not satire for the sake of satire. The characters are all someone you might've met - at work, in family, amongst friends, friends of friends. Which is why it is charming and the humor keeps you engaged. At no point is it rolling-on-the-floor-laughing, but I found myself snickering throughout. Yeah, in many ways it makes you feel good about yourself - Like you are not one of them, though they have been chosen to represent you - the youth of India - to a foreigner.Each character is also the extreme of the stereotype it represents, almost on the border of exaggeration, but you know it's not. The writer takes you to the brink of a believable character and very smartly stops. Yet, a lot of the plot is contrived. And I'm not even talking of the basic premise. There are tangents that the movie goes off on which are kind-of to exhibit a character's quirk. But, since 8 characters are being squished together in 90 minutes, many of these remain half-baked.And yet, the movie is enjoyable like a sitcom. Enjoy the now of the joke. And this is possible because of some awesome casting. From the guy who plays the geek from Bengalooru to the possibly-illiterate stockbroker. Needless to say you can laugh only if the dialogues are bright and they are timed well. And this combination occurs often enough.It is one of those that you see on a lazy Sunday afternoon when you are in the mood for something light and when you are done you forget it. No more and no less.

Damn!! It's the new bloke on the block called Prince…and he's no charming superhero in disguise, he's just a common thief trying to act ""yo..kewl"" and all that jazz!It's actually humiliating to me as an audience to start thinking about a film in terms of, ""Which complaint should I start with?"" Action, direction, acting, casting, songs, music, plot, dialogue? The deeper stuff like characterization I'll not even get into giving the genre a benefit of doubt. Just because we have seen worse, doesn't make this one anywhere close to watchable. sigh Anyway, here we go…The base plot itself had many-many interesting possibilities. A character loses his memory. He possesses a valuable that is of immense importance to smugglers, police, crossers and double-crossers alike. We haven't the foggiest why they all want it, but obviously all of them are waiting for him to recollect where he's kept the piece. There's so much there could have been done with the mind games played and cunning plots. But no, we are fed some humbug about memory being forcefully removed and some inexplicable ""medical science"" thingy with which it can come back or something like that. I don't care because I'm not made to care. Story - strike out. Action film it is, and how could I even begin enjoying it, if the only thing I could think of for the first 20-25 minutes is, ""Exactly how silly must Vivek Oberoi have felt doing this stuff in front of the green screen?."" Including the dances! They are inserted like they used to be abruptly ages ago, just for a break from the seriousness of the other stuff going on. Many action films also bank on the suave lead characters and the memorable lines they are given. You got it right, Prince is not one of those many. It has Vivek Oberoi for goodness sake! Ok, let's grant that you know with cool clothes and black shades he can pass by as stylish. But, the women! Even though they have potentially, half-way interesting characters, they are extremely annoying to say the least. Their make-up, hair-do and costumes don't help the cause. So this character who loses his memory, regains consciousness and says, Main kaun hoon? (Who am I?)…Main kaun hoon, main kaun hoon!?! For goodness sake!! The last I heard these words said in this situation was in a film from the 90s. I guess we should just thank them for not following it up with the ever-so-oft used main kahaan hoon? (Where am I?) … Geez!! I guess that's the question left for the audience to answer. No not the existential ""Who am I? Where am I?"" The very physical ""Who am I? Where am I?"", once they have gotten up from their deep slumber. Oh wait! But we have more sleep to look forward to! Yes, Prince 2 threatens to come our way with open arms.

229,929,929,929,929,Prisoners,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review3 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/prisoners-review/,,3/5.0,,2.433333333,"Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal power the beautifully shot Prisoners, directed by Denis Villeneuve. Prisoners creates a gorgeously dark world and holds the audience until the very end, making them question right and wrong all along the way.","Anybody can write a story. But translating the written word into cinema takes a whole lot more; no, not the money or the resources that a film invariably requires, but the craft to create a sense of atmosphere; the ability to evoke an emotional reaction; the sheer fortitude to go the whole hog and stick to the characters and their journey that, until then, existed only on paper. For this and so much more, director Denis Villeneuve deserves more than a pat on his back.An innocuous-enough Thanksgiving dinner between two families turns into a nightmare as the younger child of each family, both girls, go missing. The nightmare becomes more horrifying with each passing minute, as the sequence of unfolding events stems from the past and has repercussions on the future…Prisoners, which quite easily counts as one of my favourite films of the year so far, begins with a gently uttered prayer. Then, as this stark, measured, bone-chilling thriller begins to unfold, a careful cinema-watcher may notice how Christian iconography subtly but repeatedly appears through the initial half of the film, until it suddenly stops. Consequently, one can’t help but wonder if this has any significance in the alarming larger scheme of things. That is, of course, only until the writer and director choose to clear the fog and let you release that heartbeat you’d been holding up for so long. You’ll probably then forget all about the symbolism and foreshadowing, and that is where Villeneuve truly, genuinely, comes up trumps with Prisoners.His narration is extremely understated, as subtle as it can be. He lays out almost all his cards on the table earlier than most directors would have had the guts to. The trick, though, lies in achieving the balance between revealing your cards, while inviting, in fact challenging, even the most attentive of viewers to keep pace with him. Unlike a lot of thrillers where you’re always either a step ahead of the director or many steps behind, in Prisoners, you’re almost always walking alongside him. How much you enjoy the film depends on what he’s showing you, and where you’re looking.Then, of course, there is the moral ambiguity that the writer and director toy with. There’s the father of one of the missing girls, there’s the cop investigating the case, and there is the world that is affected by a terrifying ordeal. You always know how you want the film to end, but the moral questions the film poses in its journey to the end is what really holds the film together. Prisoners is embellished by at least two standout performances. Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover, father of one of the missing girls. In a span of under two years, Jackman has played such widely different characters in Real Steel, Les Misérables, The Wolverine and now Prisoners, that one can’t help but be wowed by him each time he appears on screen. His desperation, his conviction and his frustration all seem so real, you can’t help but feel for him. The revelation, though is Jake Gyllenhaal as the interestingly named Loki, the obsessive detective chasing the case. Gyllenhaal played a very similar character in David Fincher’s Zodiac, but his performance in Prisoners shows just how much he has grown as an actor. The soul of the film, however, is Roger Deakins’ cinematography. Be it the dark, torch-lit or headlight-lit frames or the sleet-obscured shots, the film’s continuous sense of murky foreboding must almost wholly be credited to Mr. Deakins. Every time I watch a film shot by him, I can’t help but feel that he is truly one of the greatest cinematographers ever. Prisoners also has a sparse background score that enhances the mood the film creates. As the characters in the film question and act on their own motivations, you question your own moral compass as well. Prisoners isn’t quite a film for everyone, and this isn’t just because of the bloodshed or the horrifying aspects of the story. The fact is that if you let yourself get sucked into the world that the film creates, you will ask questions of yourself as well. And those, usually, are the toughest ones to answer.

230,930,930,930,930,Prometheus,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/promestheus-review/,,,,2.433333333,"In Greek mythology, Prometheus is known as a cultural hero – one who stole fire from the gods for the benefit of mankind. He was sentenced to a life of torture by Zeus, where an eagle was to feed on his liver everyday while Prometheus was bound to a rock. At the centre of this myth lies the essence of humanity, a topic that even the film is trying to explore. Ofcourse, Prometheus becomes infinitely watchable with the grand visuals and action sequences. Don’t miss it!","These alternate universes are making it more and more difficult to deal with reality. Ofcourse, then some of you will argue about how you can tell what is real. But before we can go there, let me warn you that watching Prometheus in 3D IMAX will leave you with an abyss of questions and discussions about the possibilities of the human existence. What’s new about that? Believe me, you can never have enough of speculation, and Ridley Scott works on that exact sentiment, playing with your mind with every second of Prometheus. An epic-size prequel to the 1979 Alien, three decades later, Prometheus is a grand film. It’s all about the visuals, jaw-dropping and mesmerizing as they are, making the art direction and VFX near flawless. You can’t take your eyes of the grandeur, but you are forced to once you move ahead to try and answer the questions the film poses. The film begins in 2093, when archeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway (Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) are convinced of the existence of extra-terrestrial beings courtesy ancient cave paintings.They then set out on an expedition to reach the home planet of these beings on a ship called Prometheus, along with the Crew Commander Meredith Vickers (an icy Charlize Theron), a cheeky Captain Jenek (Idris Elba), the creepy, straight-faced android David (Michael Fassbender) and a bunch of geologists and technicians. Their mission to find these beings and their universe is funded by multi-billionaire Peter Wayland (Guy Pearce, whose casting quite doesn’t make any sense).Every moment of the film after they land on the planet is gripping, leaving you with not even a moment to catch a breath. What stays with you for many hours after the film is the arresting imagery of the film. It’s a combination of break-taking visuals, haunting sound design and smooth cinematography that finally give off a sense of calm surprise.   Where Prometheus lacks is in its theoretical questions - the answers of which are hinted at in the future sequel. Having brought up the regular Science versus Faith debate, it doesn’t take it’s time to establish both sides but rather, conveniently places its ideological stance. On one hand, Scott raises relevant questions about human creation and the basis of our existence; he had immense scope to toy around with the idea and leave you at a peak. However, the film quickly moves to showing a spectacular picture instead and leaves the audience confused. It’s not a confusion of questions (because who doesn’t like that) but a confusion of choice – why was a particular situation chosen to be portrayed in this manner? The answers are made to seem like they are irrelevant, trivial or worse, patched up with a fast-paced following scene. As a viewer, one hopes it’ll all be rounded in the sequel, but that is a lot of pressure on one film, especially since its finale was made 30 years ago.Prometheus’ true star is Michael Fassbender as the uncanny android David. His character keeps you on tenterhooks through the film and continues to wow you inevery frame. Following which, each character is well cast. CharlizeTheron plays the icy ship manager, and Noomi Rapace, as a believing, alert protagonist – the kind that every viewer likes to lead a film. Scott’s story-telling technique is extremely vivid. You can see how every shot was elaborately planned and bound, and the effort shows on screen. The 3D was subtle, and yet you could see how it enhanced your viewing experience. For the visuals alone, watch Prometheus. To say that it will blow your mind is a given. The movie however, will stay with you for many days after you see it – you’ll be burdened with questions, some even nagging. You deserve the experience.

One of those stories that get lost in the plethora of injustices in the world. A story that desperately needs to be told. Alas, it loses out in execution - despite Aishwarya’s sensitive portrayal of the lady who was wronged. As usual she looks stunning (without makeup at that!).","Provoked certainly brings attention to the plight of women at the hands of psychotic male chauvinists. So, what do you do when you want to get the average movie-goer to watch the sad story of a lady who is physically, emotionally and sexually abused by her husband? Get Aishwarya Rai (Kiranjit Ahluwalia) to be the lady! And she delivers with a performance that is, without any doubt, her best so far. Naah, by no means is it a flawless performance. Every once in a while Aishwarya does inadvertently slip into ‘oh, I am sorry, I am this gorgeous supermodel made to look like a battered housewife’ mode. But the positives easily outweigh the negatives this time around. And that is one woman who needs no make-up to look stunning! Performance-wise the transformation from an unsure, easily-dominated wife to a confident, inspirational woman was wonderful. Especially note the slouch turn into a confident straight back. The nuances of the complex character were captured well – frustration, anger, hatred, guilt, glimpses of happiness.What did not work for the movie though, are the gaps in the story. Though the memory-triggered flashbacks were a nice way to narrate the story, they ultimately failed to make an impact. They tried to do with dialogues what needed to be done through story and visuals. Also the shortcomings had a lot to do with the pace, the time allotted to each part of the story. While the first half took its own sweet time in establishing the background, the second half was left to cover a lot of ground (including the abrupt digressions for the side characters’ stories).The biggest hole of them all was the torture itself that Kiranjit was subjected to. All through the movie you are expecting something gruesome to happen that will shake you from the inside. But it doesn’t happen. And that is you leave the theater moved yet unconvinced - uncertain of what made a plain village girl take such a drastic step. Maybe they did not want to shoo away the audience with the gory details. But then, if the idea was to keep the audience interested, it desperately needed better dialogues. Especially, the lines given to the beautiful Nandita Das were lousy. Again, the inevitable tussle between dramatize-for-effect and stick-to-reality. Tricky one, indeed. The only thing other than Aishwarya’s moving performance that makes it worth a watch is the subject itself. This subject needs attention and is certainly more than one woman’s story. But will it make anyone stand up for the cause?

However, sloppy writing makes it a predictable, weak film as a whole. Even great performances by the lead cast don't entirely salvage it. Those who have the kind of expectations that I had for this film are bound to be massively disappointed.","Note: This is one of the rare occasions when the reviewer has chosen to revise the ratings. The rating after first viewing (at Mumbai Film Festival) was "" Catch on DVD for sure"". It has been bumped up to ""The keen must watch on screen; else DVD"" after second viewing (regular theater cut) for reasons stated below. Update: Whether it is because of what seemed like a crisper cut for the theatrical release, or whether it is because of a correction in my expectations, having already watched the film once at MFF 2012, I'm not sure; but I liked Pune 52 more after the second viewing. Much like Talaash, which set the expectations for a thriller but was more of one man's emotional journey and was best enjoyed with those expectations in mind, Pune 52 is more about the marital problems faced by a lower middle class couple in the early 90s, and makes the most impact when seen as a drama rather than a thriller.The performances by Girish Kulkarni and Sonali Kulkarni seemed even better this time. Also, the dialogues, penned by Girish Kulkarni, are outstandingly written. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I keep saying that Girish Kulkarni is one of the best Indian writers as well as actors today, and he underlines this in Pune 52. The larger issues in the film - sketchily written characters, gaping plot holes and screenplay flaws remain. Since the film is a thriller as well, I can't talk about these in detail, but it will suffice to say that there are just too many loopholes that can be pointed out in the writing. Still, for the manner in which it is shot, for being an engaging enough drama about a married couple, for the dialogues and for the performances Pune 52 is a film that makes for one theatrical watch, for sure.
Set in Pune during one of the most critical times in the history of our country - the economic liberalization days of the early 90s - it tells the story of Amar Apte and his wife Prachi, who are facing problems that stem from what Amar does for a living - he is a private detective who snoops into peoples' personal lives. Amar takes his work extremely seriously, even though others around him seem to have nothing but contempt for his lack of 'success'. Things take a turn for the murky when Amar gets involved in a case that brings him into contact with a woman named Neha. As mentioned earlier, Pune 52 always promised a lot. Intriguing promos and exciting names like Girish and Umesh Kulkarni associated with the film meant that the pressure was always on the cast and crew to deliver a knockout film. And that they certainly don't, the primary reason for it being the writing. As a character, Amar has been written shoddily. His 'dreams' of becoming a detective since he was a child seem forced and unconvincing. The 'Eureka' moment he narrates, which convinced him that he wanted to be a detective makes little sense, and the flip-flops his character makes form such a shaky character graph that it does irreparable damage to the graph of the film itself. As a thriller, the film's plot twists are predictable from a mile away. Perhaps the most disappointing part is the fact that at one point the film seems to be walking the Chinatown path, raising hopes, but then spiraling away into unflinching mediocrity soon after.As a drama between a couple whose marriage is on the rocks, the film does have its moments. The fights between Amar and Prachi are written realistically and are performed brilliantly. Also, one can't deny that the film does manage to hold the audience as far as the tension with regard to the destiny of this failing marriage is concerned.If the film remains watchable for a large part of it, it is because of the actors. Girish Kulkarni is easily one of the best actors in the country today, and he tries his best to lift his poorly written character. He manages to succeed sometimes, making you root more for him than for Amar. The fact that his voice has been dubbed over by someone else irks at times, if you are used to Girish's natural voice. Of course, it was probably done in the interest of the film, since Girish's natural voice would've been too thin for the character.Sonali Kulkarni is dependable as always. She emotes beautifully when conveying her frustration over the marriage. Her character is essentially naive, and she convinces you of that naiveté. Sai Tamhankar as the mysterious Neha looks better than she's ever looked, and she manages to bring about that air of intrigue about her.Also, a good amount of effort has been put into the production design to create the 90s feel. The old rotating dial phones, film posters, the license plate numbering of that time and even Gold Spot manage to add a feel to it. Although why exactly the film is set in that time period is a mystery. The film has been shot well only in certain parts. There are a number of inexplicably over-exposed shots, too many for it to seem necessary.Debutante director Nikhil Mahajan handles certain portions well. Also, his choice of shooting long dialogue scenes in single shots really impressed me. They show a mature attitude towards cinema. However, in the larger scheme of things his inexperience shows. Certain critical portions, particularly the thriller and backstory bits needed a more seasoned hand at the helm. The film is also far too long for its own good. Hopefully, the filmmakers will think of getting a shorter cut ready for its theatrical release. Pune 52 is by no means unwatchable. But, considering the expectations I had from the film, I walked away extremely disappointed. Update: A slight correction to the above review. According to director Nikhil Mahajan, Girish Kulkarni has dubbed his own lines for the film. Also, the cut of the film shown at MFF 2012 is a work-in-progress cut. The theatrical cut for the film is still being readied and is expected to be different from the one premiered at MFF.

Actually, even if it is, I don't want to know. This was enough for a long, long time. Though they had enough maturity to touch upon some very valid issues revolving around love, it's a shame that it translates into a highly typical screenplay with the lousiest dialogues there could be!","An average looking person barely gets half a glance from the opposite gender. The good-looking people don't necessarily like the diva status accorded to them. They are only human, and would like to be approached by genuine admirers. These are two extremely valid points that keep the geek and the beauty away. And Pyaar Impossible actually dwells into them pretty deeply. Only unfortunately, they use the tackiest lines possible. So much that even a girl would want to avoid this thorough chick-flick.Fine, you could give the writer credit for trying to have an actual story revolving around the core love story to give the film a little depth. But, except for Alisha (Priyanka Chopra) the other characters hardly had any depth. Abhay (Uday Chopra) and Siddu (Dino Morea) are as white and black as they could be. And it's not like they evoke any emotion in you as a one-dimensional character has potential to do.  It's this monochromatic view of the world, be it Abhay's father (Anupam Kher) or the supposedly 6-year old girl, Tania (who's not credited on the official site), that makes everything very flat, only that it's exaggeratedly flat. Abhay is too nice, his father too patronizing. Siddu is too mean. Sure, there might be people in the real world who are all sweetness or all manipulative. But they are no fun to watch on big screen, especially when they have nothing smart or engaging to say. Oh yeah, the Tania, the 6-year old granny is either extremely annoying or extremely mature. Sorry, that doesn't count as a shade of gray. For me, the deal was shut in the first few scenes when Uday Chopra's voiceover is 'trying' to be funny. Ok, they might have tried to prove that geeks have a lousy sense of humor, but a film is not supposed to make my eyes roll! And certainly not make me control my yawn or give out a mock-snore because the dialogues are so cliché and preachy. Somehow, I don't see much choice left to the actors in such a situation. They have to exaggerate their sugariness and bitterness and thus come across as caricatures. 
It's painful that what could have been a refreshing course on love 101 and in good detail, becomes a discourse you would want to avoid. Despite the good-looking people playing their role to perfection. Oh well…maybe next time Yash Raj Films, you'll be able to avoid clichés that you created.

Bad for director-writer Luv Ranjan that he has only met women who take advantage of the man of their life; who are manipulative and completely disregard the man's feelings in the name of love. I feel bad for the male leads in the film who are not only characters, they are symbolic of a larger population. I feel bad for the whole community who they represent. I feel bad for anyone who can relate to these men. It is sad that they haven't encountered any mature women who care and love. It is sad that a supposedly comedy film made me sad and feel bad. Okay, I had a few laughs. But, the larger picture is a bit to grim for a person who believes the world is full of healthy relationships.Oh well. By the way, who are these men who are so confident when wooing a girl that they succeed in getting her attention and more in one go. But these same men become mindless, spineless and do the lady's bidding like a domesticated pet? How? Why? Later, when they grow theis spine back they ask why too. And the answer is they want to marry their hand! (given away in the trailer itself!) No comments. Moving away from bewilderment over attitude towards relationships and coming to the movie itself. It has snappy, witty dialogue and I laughed out loud at some of them too. But, then from work, parent and girlfriend related jokes they became only girl-bashing jokes – which was also fine for a bit. It then became repetitive and predictable. The performances are believable. That is all that can be said really, given the characters were what they were. There is of course, the much expected and I guess, looked forward to monologue by Kartik Aaryan. But that too had a stale feel about it. Pyar Ka Punchnama 2 then is more or less what you expect, more of the same with a slightly better hand at direction. Storywise though if you enjoyed the first installment, you would like this one too. If you were disappointed /upset with that one, it will carry forward to this one. It is not just the fact that it is misogynist for I would have a problem with a man-hating movie too. There is no further insight or deeper look at the relationships. It is not really a part 2, in that sense, it is a remake.

Then, how can Pyaar Vali Love Story – a romantic story of the early 90s – be an exception to this overused, success-guaranteeing formula?Think of SRK-standard romance dramas, Rohit Shetty-styled action flicks, mindless songs and dances, over-the-top dialogues - combine these and the end result is Pyaar Vali Love Story. From producers to director (who previously directed dull, but widely successful Duniyadari), cast to technicians, everything about the film looks really promising. I’ve nothing against another Hindu-Muslim love story. All that really matters is its portrayal. Apparently what you get is a serious let-down.Set in the backdrop of 1992 Mumbai riots, Pyaar Vali Love Story recounts the romance of Aliya and Amar, and their struggle to stay together. Sai Tamhankar tries hard to appear as a Muslim girl, but in vain. In fact, every other Muslim character looks like they are trying too hard to look so, throughout the film. Right from the beginning, all they speak is the unconvincing mishmash of Hindi and Marathi words. Our filmmakers have continually failed to convincingly depict non-Marathi characters in Marathi films. This film is no different. It appears more and more unreal as the story progresses. Just by donning Muslim costumes or uttering Urdu words, you don’t seem Muslim. There are many other factors that come into play. This is the failure of the writers, casting directors, production designers, costume guys as well as make-up department.Sanjay Jadhav’s abilities are more questionable than anybody. The man in charge is himself to be blamed for going ahead with such an outlandish, lacklustre script. Had the plot been written thoughtfully, it could’ve still done wonders despite its inherent predictable nature.The film’s lead actor, Swapnil Joshi is the biggest disappointment. I don’t understand why this talented actor is trying to be the Shah Rukh Khan of Marathi cinema? Instead of exploring his acting, he has made himself busy playing chocolate hero. He is getting repetitive and tedious with every film. Urmila Kanetkar’s Nandini is bold, yet annoying. Nevertheless, she is far more bearable in an otherwise mediocre film.In the film, Aliya fondly calls Amar ‘stupid’. On a serious note, the word aptly suits the story. Insanely stupid to be more precise. This one is absolutely not worthy of your precious time and money.

The script does stick to its basic aim of narrating a light but neat story but the narration loses focus after the first hour. The hooking up phase is kept lively with humour and the making up part is short and thus sweet. However, the breaking up phase drags, the characters become very predictable and it is really sad to see them do the silliest things. 
The characterization of the lead pair is pretty accurate, i.e. a man in Rahul Bose’s situation and mind-set would behave like Rahul does and so would a woman in Mallika Sherawat’s shoes. Rahul also speaks to us through the movie and has done a great job of switching between talking to his co-actors and us. Mallika does have a very girl-next-door-face, I can't see what the hype is all about? Her dialogue delivery and acting (if you can actually call it that!) is very plain. However, it is the rest of her that could get a few hearts thumping, oh now I see… However, if you are there to see some talent, its Rahul’s comic timing that pulls the movie through. Unexpectedly though, the two of them together look fantastic. For a change, the intimate scenes between the lead pair makes us feel that the couple is actually attracted to each other!! 
The other actors are very ignorable; they are either too loud or too flat. However, it does not strike us immediately because the dialogues perfectly suit the characters in the first half of the movie. It is towards the intermission, that the dialogues start losing their charm and in fact become a tad redundant. The concept of Rahul acting and speaking to us intermittently is carried a bit too far and thus ends up being repetitive and non-entertaining by the end. The direction style is different, but unfortunately different is not necessarily always the best. Some really funny lines and analogies lose their effect because of the number of times they are mentioned. The dialogue-writer needs to understand, that we got it the first time! The supposedly touching scenes do not really have an impact. The music doesn’t do much for the ears, especially for people who are not into the night club culture. The choreography isn’t very exciting either. 
What sort-of saves the movie is the fact that the story doesn’t waver and is very smooth right till the end. The costume designers and make-up people need special mention because the characters were not dressed like they were out to party 24x7. Thumbs up to the story, Rahul’s acting, and costumes. But a great opportunity was lost because it didn’t look like enough attention was paid to the other departments.

In each of the three couples. Thank goodness for some decent lines and situations that make it a decent date film. ","To say that Pyaar Ka Punchnama relies heavily on the stereotyping women would be stating the obvious in an understated manner. But you are here; you are watching the film, might as well give in. And you see yourself in a land of puppies and bitches. Women are the most unreasonable, flaky, demanding, ruthlessly selfish kind of human beings. As a corollary, the other kind of humans is puppy-in-distress all the way from the eyes to the heart. If you manage to get past these obvious, annoying assumptions, there are a few situations; a few lines that make you smile because they remind you of someone you know. It is actually possible to enjoy the film if you assume that the writer/director, Luv Ranjan is not stupid enough to actually believe that all women fall in the intolerable, slappable category and all men are aawwww-so-cute-and-helpless. You have to give Luv the benefit of doubt and believe that he just happened to pick these characters. It's not like they don't exist in real life. After giving our writer/director so much, I enjoyed the characters. Only the men of course. Even as I blamed them for letting their women get them into unredeemable situations, the women themselves - at most times, I wanted to slap. In that sense the direction, the lines and the performances have succeeded. The only reason I won't rip apart the movie is the performances and what could have gone wrong with them. Each of the six main characters do a great job with their character. They actually behave like normal people. In fact, they surprised me. I'd be the last person to laugh or even smile at a monologue by a guy (Kartikeya Tiwari) about his frustrations with his girlfriend. Especially when it's long, oh-so long. But as it grew longer, it started making me laugh. Despite the repetition. I actually felt bad for the poor chap and his claustrophobic situation. If only the broad plots had a little more meat. They picked three similar starts, they chose three different situations and had three similarly ""bleh"" ways to end it. And yet it's one of those half-decent chick-flicks. I can see couples getting into an argument after watching it. And a movie that gets people to discuss it is a movie that has succeeded, even if it is in its own crooked way. This one made me wonder too. NO! not about the men and women in my life. About movies and their dependence on contrasts. A couple of weeks ago we saw Luv ka the end, where the guy was all out despicable and here we have a film that has made the woman in me hate some of the women the film represents. What's with the stark extremes? Is it because ""balance"" is boring?

And yet, Qaidi Band makes you realise how much we take for granted - as simple a thing as, we won't be punished for being good. Unfortunately, it falls prey to some cliches and becomes a tad too filmy to retain the impact of  “not overestimating the value of what we have”.We are spoon-fed some definitions to begin with and for once, it just might be fairly so. We are told what under-trials are and why they don't wear prison uniforms. After all, we shouldn't be distracted by the relatively nice clothes that the under-trials wear. However, it could have been shown rather told too.And this is where Qaidi Band distances its audiences. It is as if it is in education mode throughout, even if it has stopped the spoon-feeding. Qaidi Band is constantly exposing you to the things that it thinks you might not know – the atrocities the under-trials or other prisoners face, the sorry state of health and hygiene, the total lack of dignity and so on. Through this though, it feels like it is standing on a podium and addressing us.To its credit, it doesn't once get preachy. It keeps the message short and sweet. In that sense, some clichés are actually conspicuous by their absence. For instance, what lyrics would you expect from a music band of unjustly imprisoned men and women? A forcefully inspirational, laden with pain and despair. Even though, the lyrics aren't fun or funny, they have a subtlety about them that make you believe the impact they would have on a listener. However, this good is undone by the uneven speed at which things move in the second half. It is one of those times, when it felt like the writers wrapped it up because they couldn't come up with another way to close it. Except for Aadar Jain who goes slightly over-the-top every once in a while, the rest of the lead cast keeps things very believable. Anya Singh doesn't let you doubt the strength of the frail-framed Bindu. I just hope her skin wasn't darkened to give her a sepia thus, rugged tone. It is amusing though that Anna Ador and Lin Laishram suddenly disappear. It comes across as a casting and dates issue rather than a natural departure from the story.Films like Qaidi Band are a dillemma to recommend. They might not be movies you have to or must watch. But, if you don't, can you really complain about Hindi film industry churning out the same kind of films Friday after Friday? But then, should you spend time, money and energy on an average-ish film just because it is different?

Keeps the smile on too. But, the pace is almost soporific and has potential to disconnect you from the story. ","Not all stories are meant to get you totally involved with the characters or situations. Some are just stories that you listen to or see. Qarib Qarib Singlle is one such story – of a man and a woman who set out on a journey to get to know each other under the guise of meeting the man’s ex-es. Neither of the characters are entirely believable, nor is the situation they put themselves in, common place in real life. But, you play along because of the humor and the film’s warm texture. The warmth, however, makes the film a little too cozy slacking off into a snooze every once in a while. The beauty of Qarib Qarib Singlle is that you know the characters quite well. You know Jaya (Parvathy Thiruvothu) is comfortable with being single because she has no qualms watching films in a theater by herself, or cooking and having a drink by herself. At the risk of stereotyping she is the kind of person who does web development as a hobby. And Yogi is the one who can doze off into deep slumber at the mention of ‘w’ in ‘web development’. He laughs at his own poor puns. He regularly misses trains and planes. And all of this seems normal to us. For she like many of us will carry a sanitizer on them and still be happy living in a no-star ashram. And he earns enough to afford and prefers the comforts of a 5-star hotel, but at the same time stops his cab midway to pick up villagers who are walking barefoot on the roadside under the scorching sun.Having developed such beautiful characters, the writers stay away from making them come-of-age which is remarkable. This gives room to these aging characters to be mature. They are both have an opinion and judge the other. Yet neither of them seeks to change the other either. The lively, quirky, more interesting one doesn’t want to introduce the quieter, conventionally boring person into the colours of life. Both lead characters have the gentlest of arches because they are both very comfortable with who they are. Which is why Jaya’s sense of liberation seems hollow when she breaks the mould. Also, given these characters that Yogi falls for Jaya is a little unconvincing. You can see Jaya slowly getting attracted towards this character, but that Yogi wants to have a long-term relationship with Jaya is to be taken for granted. This could have a bit to do with Parvathy Thiruvothu’s act too, especially her dubbing. It is not that she doesn’t try hard to give a good performance, it is that the effort show. The heaving and sighing are a bit too loud giving this otherwise self-assured lady an air of always being anxious and hyper. Irrfan Khan of course wears his dead-pan look with elan. There was a time a couple of years ago when I was worried that I would be borer of this act. But, doesn’t look like it is happening any time soon, for with every film he makes me like/hate his character even better.While the characters and dialogue are done reasonably well, the overall story progresses very slowly. This is understandable considering the characters aren’t making any huge transformations. But, it makes things lacklustre at regular intervals. Parvathy breaking the 4th wall or river-rafting or an additional character in the for of the cab driver seem as mere tools to break the rhythm slightly. It doesn’t help that you have seen this formula of meeting the ex-es in Bachna Ae Haseeno. Even so, I am thankful that the film is kept fresh by keeping the gloss and glamour out. The quippy lines and funny situations are new when you see them for the first time and they bring a smile too. But, unfortunately the first time most of us would have seen and laughed at  them is in the trailer. So, while Irrfan Khan’s performance can hold you through the film. The real-life like, dullish treatment works both for and against the film. The glitz is out but that ends up making things boring. Qarib Qarib Singlle doesn’t get the balance right.

For those who watched Casino Royale, the story would make sense as this is a sequel, for others it would be a bit difficult to swallow.
The standard additives for the mix perfected over the years are in place; chases involving boats, cars and aero planes, beautiful women who can love and fight at the same time, alluring locales, a global conspiracy, and well tailored suits.  So what is it about this Bond?For one, this Bond is taking things personally; he is seeking vendetta and the country be damned.  Daniel Craig’s Bond has his blemishes; he is running hard and does not know whom to trust.  The portrayal here is not tongue in cheek, neither is it played out as a super hero.  There are moments in the film when Bond opens up and shows affinity as a fellow human being for other characters; these moments are few and far in between, but they are there.  No wise cracks, no memorable quips as he dispatches the villains, his business here is dirty, forthright, and all too human.  Two, M’s role has been fleshed out in far more detail than other films; Dame Judi Dench is superb and demonstrates an almost maternal concern for her errant agent.  Three, the villain is an ordinary human being, with no special prosthetic devices or physical abnormalities to mark him out as the Devil incarnate: Mathieu Amalric’s big, big eyes convey his lunacy, and megalomaniacal ambitions. The pace is relentless; the film opens with a car chase, carrying on from where Casino Royale left off.  The cinematography is all sepia and gray, with no bright colours in keeping with the title sequence and the overall theme of the plot.  The plot jumps from country to country in fanciful leaps and through it all we have Bond keeping pace.  The editing is fast and fractured, and leaves the viewer disoriented in the action scenes, especially in the opening sequence.  There are no grand explosions, nor spectacular stunts; the end has the mandatory blow up of the villains’ lair, but none of it is particularly impactful.  Possibly the director wants us to focus only on James Bond and his world which has been compromised by a personal relationship, and we do that as we look into Craig’s blue, blue eyes as he runs, jumps, shoots, fights hand to hand, but also seeks help from those he once tortured. 
Marc Foster has helmed Finding Never land and Monster’s Ball; two very different films.  Here he brings a brooding intensity to the whole exercise, a sort of cynical pointlessness to the notions of patriotism, love, and death.  Paul Haggis’s script does not really make sense in terms of logic, but holds up well under the demands of possibly the longest lasting action blockbuster franchise in movie history.  Betrayal is the thread which holds it all together. References are present with respect to earlier Bond films; a woman agent killed by painting her body with oil (in Gold finger it was gold paint), and an aerial dogfight (You only live twice).  The famous Bond Gun Barrel sequence appears only at the end and the theme song is a mix of hip hop and breathy funk. (No operatic music here).What will we get in the next installment, James Bond as a physically fit, skilled in combat, George Smiley with an insatiable need to understand one’s existence and purpose?  A post modern Bond without a centre (a theme which comes up in this film) running only on instinct, and a script resembling some of the noirish Coen Brothers’ films?

","You could call Queen a chick-flick, you could call it a coming-of-age film. You could even say it is an apt one to release on ""Women's Day"" weekend. Bracket it as you like it, but there cannot be enough films made like Queen. And I don't say that because Queen sees its protagonist empower herself from a small-town woman who is put down by all around her to a woman who is willing to find herself. Neither is it because a human being comes into their own despite being down in the dumps, without losing their innocence. Films like Queen should be made for the way the story is narrated. You relate to the protagonist from the word go - and that comes from a person who hates use of voice-over to introduce a film. You are with Queen, a part of her thoughts. You jump with her from thought to thought.  And the best bit - the voice-over stops there. It isn't overdone. Kangna Ranaut's Rani or Queen is innocent and that simplicity engages you instantly. Her character builds and grows ever-so-slowly, yet, you are far from getting bored. In fact, one of those rare films that I didn't want to end. Rani and Kangna weave together so seamlessly, that you cannot tell if you are falling in love with the actor or the character.  And while she (both Rani and Kangna) could have carried the film alone on her fragile shoulders, she is lent great support by the supporting cast and the characters they play. Films like Queen also show you that there are things beyond character and situations and overall plot. It's the details and the traps that you keep yourself from falling into. Tiny things make Queen, the film, even more charming - like how she doesn't let go of her handbag - no, not to the street thug as you see in the trailer - but in a club, while dancing. Also, it was so easy to have let Queen get a makeover and transform herself into a confident, outgoing girl, especially given Kangna Ranaut's glamour quotient. But, they don't take that bait. The character transforms but within a believable boundary. This aspect is so refreshing when you compare it to almost every other hindi film in which characters transform into the exact opposite at the slightest instigation.Given all the things that are right about Queen, the discussion would still be incomplete without a word about the music. Wow. Both, the writing and the performances in movies like Highway and Queen swoon you with surprise. It takes me a long while to get over this lovely feeling of being swept of my feet, especially when least expected. Good thing I am in no rush to come back to ground.

The kind who would love to see Rajnikant spoofed. But I don't see anything that can bring laughter, a few smiles - sure. A 90 minute film actually feels too long because of repetition.","So, there's cool-dude Rajnikantha. And there are people who absolutely love the route his sunglasses or cigarette take to get to their destinations. Among these are people who can't stop going gaga over his invincibility. Sample this. Me? I find the silliness funny. The sunglass-cigarette routine make me smile about 3 times. But then, it gets repetitive and thus predictable and ultimately boring. Exactly what happens in Quickgun Murugun which spoofs Rajni.Our man, Quickgun Murugun - the cowboy, the protector of the cows - is out to do his job, viz, protect cows from the fanatic non-vegetarian, Rice Plate Reddy. To fulfill his duty he convinces the officers of the other world to send him back to this world. And so on and so forth.Sounds outrageous and out-of-the-world hilarious. But it ain't that ROFLarious. There isn't much comment you can make about such films, right? There's the usual ricocheting bullets and super-power-like action. Acting is intentionally over-the-top and overtly melodramatic - by one and all - okay except maybe the cameo by Vinay Pathak. So is the direction, especially in terms of the long pauses to enhance the already outlived-its-stay drama. Or even the emotional drama that punctuates the flow of the film, the exaggeration of everything in every frame. But, it's a spoof, so it's all obviously deliberate and supposedly necessary, what can you say? Certainly you are not allowed to complain. However, there are some bits and pieces that work. These make you smile and occasionally that smile grows wider. Each character's name is a cackle each. Also a lot of the smiles are hidden in the background, in the art-work, some reference that'll make you sneer at both - the joke and your smartness because you noticed it. Another bit I completely enjoyed is the background score. It's creative and it's funny. There's one bit where a western-film theme music is playing on a flute. Nice! There is also this comment on how super-heroes and God-like humans are necessary to get rid of the filth in the society today. A good vs. evil war is more obviously portrayed as a dev vs. daanav (God vs. Satan) war. What's more? Like Lord Krishna our man has more than one love interests. There are lot of tiny comments tucked in too. Like the irony that the anti-vegetarian demons have to use different vegetables as weapons. Celebrities used to advertise commodities, an Indian's love for mother's cooking, a mother's pride on how well she cooks, etc. But the novelty wears off. With each of the things I liked and found funny, it was so only for the first couple of times. The third repetition onwards it became boring. So much so that one and a half hour seems too long to sit there for this.

Romance for the sake of violence. Comedy thrown in. Wannabe masala.,"Love conquers all. Or does it? Whether it does or not, do you care? At least R...Rajkumar doesn't make you.   It makes you feel love and romance is just a means to meet the end of making an action film with Shahid Kapoor as the star. Shahid Kapoor does make the most of it though. His comic timing as required for a film of this nature is decent, and he does his best to emote anger, fatigue, worry and the rest too. Unfortunately, the comic lines are either over-writtent to sound way too ""filmy"" or are inane. Similarly, Sonakshi Sinha lands herself in another role which requires her to play second fiddle to the male lead. Though her introduciton on screen with a fight sequence makes you believe that this one might just have some meat for her. You see glimpses of variety that she can do, but it is too little and certainly disheartening after what we saw her do with Lootera. Yes, I know, I am still stuck there. That aside, you have Sonu Sood with a lot of brawn. It's very interesting that R...Rajkumar, a film that clearly wants to hit the masala film lover in you, has a villain who is better looking that the lead pair put together. Considering that I have spent three paragraphs on the actors, it is safe to assume that there is very little to talk about in the other departments. The writing least of all. It certainly didn't have material to be stretched into a screenplay of 2.5 hours. I must say though, for the flat and unimaginatively predictable overall plot it does manage to bring in an unanticipated turn of events. But not to worry, it goes back to being as was expected in five minutes. There is a lot of action packed in too. Some of it is even a little innovative at the beginning. But, the purpose is so masked and the killings so random that you can stay amused only so much. Add slo-mo and close-ups and you have tuned me off. Of course, that means the cinematography is dramatic and the background music loud as is associated with any film of this genre. That then leaves the music department, which well, might have foot-tapping material, but the lyrics are outright awful. And somehow awful lyrics almost always translate to sleazy dances by women. Yet, I wouldn't like to take away anything from all the heart that Shahid Kapoor puts in the dances. The choreography is mind-bogglingly complicated, as they are in any Prabhu Deva film. Also, those too become repetitive and eventually dry up. Not to mention, as usual, there is nothing graceful about dances set up by him. In that sense then, R...Rajkumar is exactly what you expected it to be. If not as a Prabhu Deva film, as a film that aspires to entertain with masala. And yet, the house was full, with equally enthusiastic whistles and hooting at Shahid Kapoor, Sonakshi and Sonu Sood. Correct, I don't understand this world.

Cool"" action sequences. Yeah, yeah even if you are exposed to ""Hollywood"" action.

","Ra.One's first-day-first-show was reviewed by wogma's guest reviewer Pradeep Menon here. Thank you so much, Pradeep for doing this for wogma. 
I was off for Diwali with family and saw the film a couple of days later. Here's how I liked Ra.One.
I was off for Diwali with family and saw the film a couple of days later. Here's how I liked Ra.One.Ra.One works as a brilliant film for kids. And I say that with no sarcasm at all. From the time I heard the premise of the film, it gave a very children's film vibe. Of course, for the fear of alienating most of its audience, Ra.One couldn't be marketed as a kids film. But, in this day and age where being nice is not ""cool"" enough, Ra.One goes on to show what happens when you try to mess with the ""good > evil"" formula. Or like Pradeep said, ""it tries"".It is only an attempt because the moral of the story is very functional, very shallow. When a woman who loves her husband, grieves only perfunctorily, using a two-minute song as a medium AND is ready to look all shiny and hot for the next party number, you can barely care for the character who just died. As an adult, I wonder, whether it was the right lesson in morals at all. But as a child, one could be more forgiving and focus on the job at hand - kill the villain and cheer up.The movie-lover in me takes this lack of warmth in stride and focuses on how a film made for entertainment allows a dark event like death to happen. That and all the slick action at a swift enough pace that I didn't get bored in a two-and-a-half-hour film with a fifteen-minute ad-filled interval. That is a huge plus for me who wants every minute beyond the 100-105 minute mark to count.While all the action is executed by a team that is obviously the best in its field, the writing is mediocre - both the dialogue and the overall story. The film tries too hard to be funny, and almost all the ""one-liners"" fall flat. The non-funny, supposedly emotional/inspirational lines are ""bleh"". The only line that stayed with me as a powerful statement was said by Ra.One the villain, which can also be heard in the promos. And I wish I had more of that, and also more of Ra.One, the character. I was supposed to fear him only because my protagonist feared him, not because there was anything menacing about him. And I can't blame actor, Arjun Rampal, the story itself didn't have any sub-plots or events that exposed anything loathsome about him. I need something powerful, if I'm supposed to hate a software program, right? It could also be because the only thing at threat is a little boy's life. It isn't as if the earth is being destroyed by aliens or world peace is at stake. And there isn't anything extra endearing about the little boy or his gorgeous mother Kareena Kapoor for me to feel the fear on his behalf. Instead, all we get is mumbo-jumbo in the name of how this game really works? We have a villain that has the power to take control over others' mind, and the writers couldn't think of intense situations for us to see his power. There is the one scene with Kareena Kapoor, but that comes across as a device to give her some more screen time with a different expression, than anything else. The climax is lame, but what it leaves is an interesting premise for a sequel, but of course, it will need some out-of-this-world writing to make good use of it. The one thing that comes as a pleasant surprise because it didn't happen is that Shah Rukh Khan doesn't fill every frame. Also, he doesn't ham and go all Shah Rukkkkhy on us, though he loses his Tamil accent way too often. There is one scene in which his character Shekhar is scared out of his wits, I forgot he's The SRK, I was taken over by Shekhar's fear and confusion over what's happening - absolutely un-hero like, and certainly non-star like. There are these little elements that make the film likeable. There isn't much to take home, but the 2.5 hours spent in the theater are not all bad. There are sequences in the film that made me miss my kids. I know where one will laugh out loud, and when the other will clench my hand with fear. Yes there's a lot of juvenile humor which I'm giving my kids two more years to snap out of.  I'm surely going to test my hypothesis out, not that I have a choice, for they both want to watch the movie, I've had to make a promise, ""Even if you don't like it, mamma"" :D I'll surely update this space if there are any interesting observations. Till then, a very Happy Diwali to all of you. And once again, thank you Pradeep for doing a wogma review on day 1.

An intense story yet not an 100% immersive experience.","You know what they say about history lessons? They have to be told in an engaging way, else the kids are going to doze off. No matter how old they are. Even if it is in a film format. Fortunately, for Raag Desh, the story by itself is interesting. Unfortunately, it is bogged down by dates and names, elongated scenes and dramatic music, choppy narration and missing links.Had I known the dates were of little consequence, I would have totally ignored them and saved the disproportionate amount of brain space they take away. Same goes for names. And for repetitions. I don't know about you, but for every repetition, I tend to think about it twice wondering why it was said again. Did I miss a detail that was different? Especially, when it is a director like Tigmanshu Dhulia who you can trust to trust the viewer's intelligence. We would have recovered a part of the cost of the ticket, if we got Rs. 10 for every time the accused soldier's names and crimes were repeated. It does get exasperating.Anyway, the writer-director does take some interesting calls in using non-linearity as a narrative tool. But, only parts of it work. That the three soldiers recall their parts of the story as the actions are called in court, worked. They flow smoothly. However, it gets confusing quickly because not all flashback follow that pattern. Also, despite all the dates, names and repetitions, it isn't clear who is where and when. The facts seem all muddled. Again, like a history text book chapter, steps in the story seem to be skimmed over, thus losing the logical flow. In the larger picture though, it doesn't matter because you get the gist. And this story is not about the details. It is about the overall impact, not about the individual players. Just like the court case wasn't about the three soldiers, it was about a frustrated nation. Which is why the three actors, Kunal Kapoor, Mohit Marwah, and Amit Sadh don't have a huge role to play. They are intense in their war scenes and they are intense in their court room scenes. In fact, their entire act reminded me a lot of A Few Good Men  The only actor who stands out is Desai playing Desai. The rest of the actors especially the ones in which the politicians gather are theatrical. Yet again, Raag Desh falls in the category of films that I'd much rather be disappointed in than not watch it at all. And Raag Desh is not a complete disappointment because of the core story and the part it plays in our independence. Today, I saw two films that are lesser known chapters in Indian history – one from 40+ years ago and the other from 70+ years ago. Irrespective of the quality of the films and their accuracy, compared to those times and the sacrificers the generations before us made to just survive, we live in superbly liberated times. I wonder what a film 30-40 years later about today's times would look like. Would it feel like they are living in better times than now? I surely hope they don't think our live were like the third film I saw today. shudder

An hour after I left the cinema hall, and I am relishing the experience of not having understood the film completely. Oh, the lovely feeling of mulling over the lingering after-taste of a film. Despite a few issues with it - issues I'd have held a grudge against, if they were in another context. Context - that isRaanjhanaa's biggest strength. Not only that of Benares and its loafers who woo girls in two ways, or that of college politics, but also the differences between characters and how they play out because of those differences.  Of course, there's the music which adds a lovely texture to the milieu of Benares and Delhi. In fact, the first hour or so plays out like a musical. But its the other things that  are very unlike Hindi films that work forRaanjhanaa - like the two protagonists and a couple of the side characters are sketched out well, are intriguing and have lovely shades of gray.In fact, the main leads are as gray as a lead character gets in Hindi films. In the first few lines itself, Kundan (Dhanush) accepts our apprehensions about him from the trailers - that he is not ""good-looking"" - in a very matter-of-fact tone. From thinking of Kundan as a loser who is wooing a girl way out of his league - Zoya (Sonam Kapoor), you unknowingly start warming up to him. And even as you like him, you are not sure he deserves this woman who is smarter, better-looking, etc than him.On the other hand, you are not sure, Zoya is good for him either. She has her own thick shade of gray. Yet, Sonam Kapoor has a charming screen presence of her own to accept that there can be anything not-white about her. Yet she conveys ambiguity about her character's intentions throughout. That could be just because she pretty much maintains the same expression through the film. There are a few moments when you feel Zoya's pain and confusion, there are times when you want to scoff at her games, but we are soon back to the ambiguous expression. This time we can let it slide because it does seem intentional. There is something about this actor that makes you want to give her another chance. Dhanush on the other hand, comes across as the simple lad with simple intentions as his character Kundan. There are a few times he slips into a South Indian accent but that  bit is conveniently covered up by making him a South Indian Pandit in Benares. Yes, yes, I know there can be South Indian priests in  Benares, it is just a darn good coincidence. But, some how he intentionally converts you into liking his character even though you start out with a distinct dislike, and its not just because he is the underdog.  Other than the broad stroke of true love and what one can allows oneself to go through when one believes they are in love, there are other underlying currents. Of course, there is the entire angle of political unrest and that of a dissatisfied section of youth trying to do what it can. That too is subtly put down with a neat little satirical scene. The one layer I particularly enjoyed is the irony of a boy stalking a girl all over town in the same film that has college students do street-plays about eve-teasing. The same girl who plays around with the sentiments of a boy who is in love with her participates in plays that talk about women being taken advantage of because they are women. These little things bring a smile.As do many of the quips. While some of these one-liners bring the house down with laughter there are others that sound cheesy and yet manage to make you smile. And then comes the last 15-20 minutes which leave you confused. The first two hours have done enough good to let this last bit cause too much damage. In fact, I enjoyed this air of mystery. Characters behave out-of-character and yet their actions don't take you completely by surprise. And I'm not complaining if they are creating space for a sequel, though I'd have apprehensions like I would of any sequel. Yet, you cannot shake off the feeling that it feels incomplete or even rushed. It did make me wonder more than once if the writers couldn't think of an appropriate and copped out by leaving it unsaid. That's Raanjhanaa for you, leaving you with a lot of mixed feelings, but in a good way.

Or did it? A boy and a girl met at a party - only they are middle-aged. They are drunk, they are naughty. Is it inevitable for physics-chemistry-biology to play their role? If 'it' happened, would it be 'that' happened? If 'it' didn't happen, is it okay, even if the thought of doing the unmentionable occurred to both parties. Is it worse if one of them is married and the other is only attached without legalities coming in the way? All questions that might plague any drawing room conversation in urban suburbia. They are put forth subtly and with sensitivity. Also to maintain interest there is a nice build-up. But unfortunately it's towards an unworthy climax. So much so that everything thus far seems in vain.But, you look back and you realize though they didn't leave an impact there were interesting characters spread through the film. Each of the friends in the group is going through a different phase in his/her life. An elderly couple has come to terms with life as is and has found their way to enjoy it. Another couple seem to have a wonderful understanding of each other, so much so that they seemed to be bored of each other. And hence get themselves into situations that can complicate life. It might seem that they do it unnecessarily but maybe that's their way of keeping life interesting. Another couple is going through the initial phase of incompatibility, getting upset, and lovey-dovey cajoling. The interactions in the group tell you that even the simplest of people have complicated emotions.While the performances of most are as you'd expect - Rajat Kapoor, Ranvir Shorey. The one surprise is Dalip Tahil. Let alone talent, just seeing him do something different is refreshing. Thanks to whoever cast him, we get to see a non-caricatured Dalip. Also, one thing that I've always admired about Neha Dhupia is that though she does typical roles of a seductress, the films she chooses to do them in have something different about them. Here too she plays the mystery woman, pretty efficiently. Had it not been for the low budget-induced low-quality texture of the film, I think her performance would have been more effective.

Wish the film was advertised as modern Ram Leela performed in a tribal theater. That expectation would have prepped me to deal with the over-dramatization a lot better.,"What is my job as a person who's writing her opinion of a film? To let you know how I liked it and why. Sure. But Raavan made me want to warn you. Warn you that though it is not an exhilarating experience, one might have expected it to be, there is a trick you could use to enjoy the film. Don't think of it as drama, or an engaging take on one serious issue or the other. Think of it as a decently-made musical. An opera.Almost everything about the film is poetic. Barring a few places, the cinematography and the background music are fabulous. There are a couple of scenes where the camera goes round and round the character with the sole purpose of making the audience's head spin. Other than that though, you can sense the fog, the dew, the breeze around the characters. The mist adds to the lyrical photography. Similarly, save a few spots, the background music is extremely different and covers a HUGE range of music. My understanding of music is pretty basic, but I loved the use of folk/tribal music. Also, using different types of music for different characters and situations was not only noticeable but rather lovely. How I wish we could get complete OSTs of our films. But like love can't finance your materialistic needs, a technically beautiful film can contribute only so much to making the film ""good"". The culprits here are the pace and narrative style of the film. The key word in that previous statement is 'style'. In his attempt to make the tough terrain visually suave, Mani Ratnam forgot the K-I-S-S principle. The montage that the film starts out with is truly breathtaking. Without saying a word, a few situations and characters are established. But, it doesn't remain that smart throughout. In fact, there is a huge slack-off period before the climax-with-great-potential. The dilemma is wonderfully created by a statement that the film is trying to make, ""In every Ram there's a Raavan and vice versa."" All too sudden and too late. Nothing is made out of it. Also, there wasn't time left to delve into the details. ow which one was the cause and which one the effect, I do not know. All I know is that I was saddened to see super-gray characters killed because of hollow writing. Given that and the decision to make the film as close to a theatrical performance (hopefully intentional), the cast section should have been titled over-actors. Govinda brings that occasional smile. I never thought the prettiest human, nature must have created, Aishwarya Rai, was any good as an actor. But Abhishek Bachchan films always attracted me towards them. This film has made me reconsider him as an actor. It was uber-annoying to see him stylishly walk like he walked in Bluffmaster.And despite all of the above, there are times when you are made to think. Especially when compared to the ages-old epic. It occurred to me that the agni pariksha was not only an insult to Sita's honor but also offensive to Raavan's virtuousness. And did Laxman just cut Surpankha's nose, or that was the metaphor we have been conditioned to ignore? Oh, the blasphemy! While it's pretty neat that the film does give these things to ponder about it also gives as bonus the agony of having to wait even longer for a film I can highly recommend.  sigh

It horrifies, and gets you on the edge. But like all horror movies it also makes 140 minutes seem like much, much longer. Maybe I didn't enjoy it as much because I don't subscribe to the belief they endorse. But because there's some attempt to elaborate rather than skim, the watch wasn't a complete waste.","God resides within us, we just need to check. ORGod is dead, it doesn't really matter how we behave. ORGod exists and he is happy/unhappy based on what we do/don't do. ORGod exists but won't help us unless we help ourselves. ORWhatever!!? Who cares?Each of the above value systems and more are represented by one or more characters in Raaz. Makes for interesting debate? Yes, but loses direction too, since it'd take some real skill to articulate things when you are taking on so many points of view.Sure, there is a definite side that the movie ultimately takes, but some of the beliefs portrayed are scary. Not because of the appropriately used background music and sound design, or the jump-in-your-seat horrific visuals. But, because they are just so inhuman. I doubt all the makers subscribe to that way of life. But, I guess they do believe that the idea of inhumanity sells. And you know what the irony is? One of the characters is shown in bad light because he ""sells"" stories based on his campaign against superstition.Anyway, getting out of all the theo-talk, so many types of characters ultimately leads to mega-confusion and also leaves each one of them pretty uni-dimensional. More so because pre-interval the characters and their situations take their own time to develop. And suddenly post-interval a host of new characters are introduced and obviously each one of them is vying for attention.The plot that develops in the second half along with its sub-plots is interesting but the resolution is far from satisfactory. Usually unexplained issues increase the intrigue and I like them because they keep me thinking even after I've left the hall. But Raaz's climax feels like, ""so much hoo-hah for this?"" When they provide you with each line to join dots and leave one out so blatantly, it comes off more as a loophole than a 'point to ponder about'.Mohit Suri, like always got me curious with the intense opening sequence. But it instantly infuriated me because of this piece I read a couple of days ago. How could they ask for any censor certificate other than 'A'?! I'd hate to see any child watching some of the visuals in the movie. Not to get very excited peoples, these are not X-rated visuals - these are just the kind that make you squirm and wait for the scene to get over.However, there's Kangna Ranaut. So, there's enough skin-show too. She does well with her screaming scenes. What's interesting is that while I don't feel for her character, she does make me pray that I'm never in her position. I didn't identify with her character. But it made me go, ""hell, I don't want to see the things she's seeing!"" The director-actor duo seem to have done well together, because we've seen her do similar stuff earlier. She does look ravishing on the ramp too - but that too we've seen earlier.Adhyayan needs to start at the basics - let's work on dialogue delivery to start with, get me interested as an audience. And till then DO NOT dance, please. Emraan Hashmi always makes a sincere effort. Since, the requirement for expressions is only bewilderment and care, he can't do much. But, at least he now has bagged the two.An opening title card preaches Sant Kabir's doha asking us to look within ourselves before pointing fingers. The protagonist learns that the hard way. But the connection between what she goes through and why is very flimsy. Not to mention, what the movie tries to convey is the opposite of what I believe in. Yet, I also believe in respect for the opposite view. So, while I didn't agree with the stand taken, I didn't mind watching it and getting a wee bit terrified along with it too.

It's the same old unintentional comedy found in a lazily made horror film.","Raaz 3 is a very regular horror film. It provides it share of unintended laughs, goes through the motions of trying to spook you with sudden peek-a-boo by the devil. And since there is a devil at work you cannot escape the age old science vs. faith argument. Unfortunately, nothing about the way it is done is novel either. Sure, you get to see Bipasha Basu in a viciously negative role and you do wish death upon her. But what you see in the trailer, is just about what she maintains for the length of the film. Somehow the character's arc sounds way too similar to that from Heroine except the black magic part, hopefully. If Bipasha plays the dark witch, Shanaya, Esha Gupta is the purest of pure whites, Sanjana. Which basically translates to her screaming and getting scared a whole lot. This must certainly be covered in Acting 101, and Esha Gupta does that just fine, except for the times her diction goes off.Bang between the two is gray Aditya (Emraan Hashmi) who is caught between what seems like duty and love. Herein lies the greatest folly of Raaz 3's concept. Something as disastrous as black magic is supported by Aditya for some flimsy reasons. You are never once convinced that he is that subservient to Shanaya's wishes. Emraan Hashmi, must be able to carry such roles with effortless ease, especially since he gets to seal a couple of problem situations with what he does best, a  kiss. Besides the regular stock of songs and aerobic dances, Raaz 3 has its expected share of scenes that are meant to scare with a relentlessly thumping background score. Not a single of these 'scary' scenes come as a shock that will make you edge towards the end of the seat. This is despite a reasonable dilemma faced by Aditya. But, it isn't taken too far and the struggle is too superficial. The 3D too is used either just for the sake of it except for just a couple of times for a few 'horror' scenes, not to mention that you can see the blur/ghost at times even while wearing the 3D glasses.Everything about Raaz 3 feels shallow and very uni-dimensional.

There are enough pieces laid out for you. You want to piece them together but you struggle to fit it together. And then puuufff! You do it. Then your job is to just lay back and see it unfold. Your involvement has disappeared. Now, how far your puuufff moment is away from that of the film's big reveal moment determines if the movie did it well or not. Unfortunately, for Raaz Reboot, you figure it out some time around interval and there is long lag between that and when you're told. Other than the “why” horror films barely have anything new, right? The “how” is merely a matter of details like: 
- Where will blood-colored liquid spookily drip from?
- What is going to pop out from the wash basin? 
- When the lead lady looks up scared, what shape would the spirit have taken?  
- When will the priest be called in?  
- Which religion(s) will the priest belong to? Which religion will finally succeed?    And the “why” is interesting only until you've figured it out. Raaz Reboot checks the above list and does a bit more. However, there are a few things that it does or avoids that make the first half engaging. Like the pieces of the puzzle itself – the marital disharmony, the secret, the couple's other relationships. Also, the film doesn't leave its protagonists alone. These are smart people who go seek help or at least try to, instead of braving it by themselves.  So, you don't have the usual horror film question, “why won't she just tell her best friend?”Yet, there are way too many gaping questions about motivations like, “Now why would one behave this way if one knew that?” I am not even talking about the supernatural mumbo-jumbo.Fortunately, the performances are above what we have come to expect from films in this genre from this production house. Now, Kriti Kharbanda and Gaurav Arora have a lot of chemistry-free, flat moments. But, individually, they do well to scare and be scared. I enjoyed Emraan Hashmi's performance too. He keeps you guessing to the best of his capabilities. That he is let down by the writing department is another story.I was engaged more than I expected to be. I had inadvertently tight muscles till the culprit was obvious. But then again, I scare easily. If you want to be spooked but not too seriously, you could just skim through this one when there's nothing else on TV.

252,952,952,952,952,Raazi,"Watch for sure, preferably in theatre",wogma review,/movie/raazi-review/,,,,4.3,"A thriller that has your heart beating constantly for the protagonist’s safety is gripping because it is based on real life events and has strong performances. Also, Raazi avoids a few things it ought to have, making it even better.","Were it not based on a real life, Raazi would have been easily dismissed as too simplistic and thus unbelievable. In fact, it would even be accused of being too filmy. Not just by me or a handful of us who watch films every week, but by almost anyone who sees it. Which is why the story becomes even more compelling – a woman actually did that! She, Sehmat (Alia Bhatt), really walked into a Pakistani household as a daughter-in-law with an intention to spy on family members who are officers of the Pakistani military intelligence. She was not a professional spy, so she trained quick and hard. She was trained not only in Morse code and action, but also in how to be a “good” daughter-in-law. You see now, why we wouldn’t believe it if it weren’t a real person. Of course, all her deeds are made believable and human because of Alia Bhatt and the rest of the cast. Vicky Kaushal convinces you that he is a darling of a husband. Similarly, Jaideep Ahlawat plays the caring-yet-ruthless-yet-tender-yet-functional trainer and mentor to Sehmat well. However, Aman Vashishtha as the co-trainer shines silently amongst the supporting cast with his subtle and effective performance.And once you accept all the mind-blowing details of how Sehmat went about her work as a daughter-in-law and spy, Alia Bhatt’s portrayal of an amateur spy make you want to watch her back. I literally caught myself wanting her to have an ally who stands guard while she is doing all this dangerous stuff. You also are with her as she goes through the moral dilemma between patriotism and humanity. Unfortunately, the situations Sehmat finds herself in call for a repetition of being nervous and playing devious, so Alia’s act becomes slightly restricted. But, save for a couple of scenes where she arguably goes unnecessarily shrill and comes across as over the top, I would give as much credit for my racing heart to her as I would to the story. The story itself is of course as gripping as it seems unreal. The exposition bits are awkward and cumbersome though. They come across as forced because of the obvious intent. Sehmat is tender and brave because she saves a squirrel by jumping in front of a car. She is fragile because she doesn’t like injections, she has a photographic memory because she can recall obscure phone numbers. Similarly, the training montage is perfunctory. To be fair though, I have given up on seeing anything new in such montages. After this exposition though, once the film gets on with the actual story, it keeps you glued through to the end. Sure, there are the spoon-feeding voice-overs that come in the form of Sehmat recalling an instruction. But, it is obviously for the audience’s benefit. While the film could have been crisper if it took care of these smaller things, the pace isn’t bothersome once the story picks up with Sehmat’s entry into Pakistan. Interestingly, Raazi’s story is kind of alluded to in Ghazi Attack, the film about the actual Pakistani submarine attack that Sehmat worked on warning the Indian naval force about. This highlighted the contrast in the tone adopted by Raazi. It would have been very easy for Raazi to become a high-pitched take on nationalism like Ghazi Attack and in fact, like many other films in the genre. But, Raazi consciously avoids it all to make you feel the patriotism rather than shove it down your throat. And of course, like many other films in the genre Raazi points out the futility of war. Sure, like the film’s title suggests, Sehmat took on an almost fatal mission willingly, but did she really?

253,953,953,953,953,Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewNotepad36 Critic Reviews 2.9/5.0 1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/rab-ne-bana-di-jodi-review/,2.9/5.0,5/5.0,,3.6,"rab ne bana di jodi takes on the nitty-gritty of the romance in an arranged marriage. Enough reason for Aditya Chopra to bring in the mush and gush. Yet, ""What a woman wants?"" and ""What her man is capable of giving"" is explored with some insight. We are growing up, but only 'haule haule'","The sun shines on the city's landmarks and makes them look even prettier. And you know you are in a YRF movie. Albeit this time, you see the ruggedness of the city too. You also are in awe of the restraint. 15-20 minutes and no mention of a foreign location. Another 5 minutes and the background music is still in the background. Wow! 10 more minutes and you might just want to pinch yourself because Shah Rukh Khan hasn't yet done that annoying thing with his eyebrow and lips. And...the spell breaks. Bring on the accordion, the loud chatter, the self-referencing, and all. We were missing you. There are only three two-and-a-half characters here, Surendra, his wife Tani and his friend Bobby. Yes, the back-story is barebones or even less. This leaves room for the crux of the relationship. ""L-O-V-E"". And here it thankfully goes a couple of layers deep. It takes you into the world of this twosome that got married without really knowing each other. What it takes for two decent human beings to make it work and stick it out. The sacrifices one makes in the form of changes to your persona that lead to claustrophobia. Just like it is frustratingly boring for an extrovert to convert into an introvert, it is not really acceptable for a shy person to have bubbly enthusiasm as a permanent feature. These are all subtle issues that need delicate treatment. And here starts the real trouble. The timid Surendra, in his attempt to please Tani transforms into a bright gold and yellow creature, called - what else - Raj. Why? Can only the exact opposite personality can create impact and impress the Mrs? Isn't there anything in between? I'm not even interested in the missing 'how', the 'why' hasn't stopped bothering yet.We have a star amongst us who needs to keep everyone pleased. In the name of versatility, his character HAS to make a diagonally opposite change. Actually, I had just begun to enjoy Shah Rukh's performance as the middle-class government servant, Surendra Sahni, with the minor twitches and eye movements when suddenly he transfigured into a badly-dressed Shah Rukh Khan - eyebrow curled, whispering romantic inanities, piling on an inconsistent accent and only waiting for someone to grant him the permission to start stutt-stutt-stuttering. Many thanks to whoever said NO! The story is about Surendra and his wife. Why did we have Vinay Pathak playing Surendra's friend, the devil's advocate, the supposed ""inner voice""? His character was especially redundant given that Surendra had an alter-ego of his own. There wasn't enough room for Vinay to maneuver around and yet he can make over-the-top acting look adorable. Surendra's lady love, Tani, played by Anushka Sharma seems like she has the 'single-expression' training form the YRF's-Aishwarya-Rai school of non-acting. The other expressions are all taken care of by that drop of glycerin. The role of women in movies like these is very cleverly written. She's the center of the plot because the protagonist, his alter-ego and his friend all care for her, adore her, love her. But, the lady's part is ever-so sketchily written. What do we know about her? Are we made a part of her confusion? Do we know why she makes one decision or the other? No! And thus I resign to how these roles are written to give us a feeling that it's all about the woman. And the climax too...well...let's just say the movie has a male-chauvinistic touch. Also, our newly married couple lives in a socio-economic vacuum. They have no social pressures. In the heart of Amritsar, a married woman dances and prances about with a 'stranger'. Sure there are the token office mates, but here we see the one Panjabi family with only two members - the husband-ji and the wife-ji and the transformed husband-ji. And yet, it is not the take a chill-pill and watch kind of movies. The few facets of a utopian arranged marriage that rab ne bana di jodi touches upon are intriguing. I wonder how much those who can't identify with such an arrangement will appreciate it, but that the makers bothered deserves extra credit. What hurts is that if they are smart enough to hit upon these particular nuances, how can they monkey around so much for the rest of the movie? Songs: Anything about the music in the above review would be as out of place as the songs were in the movie. So, I'm attaching it here in the end like a song in the end credits. Songs have always been more about the lyrics for me. And I look forward to Jaideep Sahni's play with words. I call him the list-maker of the industry. His lyrics are usually in the form of lists. As boring as it sounds, they are usually interesting observations. The most ill-placed song ""hum hai rahi pyar ke"" had the most beautiful tweaking of phrases/songs/names of Hindi movies. It had delightful picturization and guest appearances too. It would have worked so much better as an award show performance. The rest was all ho-hum - lyrics, music, picturization, costumes, etc.

But the acting, the merry-go-round plot twists, and the dialogues are barely average.","No doubt, some of the action sequences and a few of the aerial shots can be enjoyed only on the big screen. But, barring these, there isn't anything spectacular about the execution. In fact, a good many departments are just about mediocre - acting, dialogues, set design. And I am not even talking about less superficial things like character and tension build-up. The screenplay for Race seems to be in a race with itself at, at least, a couple of levels. (Sorry, the use of ""race"" was just too irresistible!). At one level, we have one sub-plot waiting to chop into action as soon as the previous one is done. At another, each sequence is trying to outdo the other in terms of ""gotcha! You didn’t see that coming now, did ya?"" The narrative was interesting till it maintained the scheme of letting the audience know a little more than the other characters in the movie. Later it becomes the regular ""Guess who's the bigger fool?"" for the audience too. And in a way, you can take a fair guess at what is coming. If it's not going to be the obvious, it's going to be the opposite of the obvious, so there you go.The good thing though is that the women too have an actual role in the scheming. Don't worry guys - its Bipasha, Katrina and Sameera - they won't let you down if you are here for the skin show. They are not great at emoting. Anyway the story is more about their devious minds and not their emotions. You don't really feel for any of the men either. They are all so engrossed in outsmarting the other that they forget to feel deceit or love. There is this one-off expression by Akshaye Khanna that makes you laugh - intentionally, intentionally, so it's alright. It was all too funny, to see the actors complementing each other's acting skills on screen. Just in case no one else did that?The Karamchand-Kitty gig mimicked by Anil Kapoor-Sameera Reddy is rather tedious and so is the monologue by Johnny Lever.The dialogues do sound very labored. A lot of labor seems to have gone into searching the internet for sms jokes. Then they are laboriously forced into the flow of the story. The one-liners range from adult, as in they are 18 years old, to sexual-innuendo adult.The action sequences weren't fresh either. The one introducing Saif Ali Khan, and the climax, are executed really well, but there's nothing unique or stunningly creative about them. I absolutely enjoyed some of the aerial shots. Especially, the winding roads (South Africa, supposedly) with the backdrop of the rugged terrain indeed make you feel like whizzing past them. And if it's a Ferrari, who's complaining?What seemed rather amateurish, especially considering it is a high budget movie, is the art design. Good thing a lot of it was outdoors. From the hospital in South Africa to the tacky signboards that said ""Department of Home Affairs"" or ""Stallion"". Even movies on a shoestring budget do better than that. Or this song ""Khwab dekhe jhootha mootha"" with its ugly pink stars in the background which reminded me of a shabby set in Marigold.""Pehli nazar"" always sounded good and, sans Atif Aslam in your face every 4th second, looks good too. The title song and ""zara zara"" are foot-tapping numbers. And they do have purpose, you see. They are strategically placed after a twist/turn/roll in the tale. So, the audience can ruminate over the recent events of the story. Another purpose that they dutifully serve, of course, is to promote the movie. And whoever chose the songs that would go into the promos did a great job. Because the songs that didn't make it are really awful - ""dekho nashe mein"" and ""Khwab dekhe jhootha mootha"". Having said all that, I must say there is something about the movie that made it work overall. I don't know exactly what. Because each department has some major flaw or the other. It just maybe that the departments synergized well enough to let it have a general ""one-time watch"" feel.Save for a couple of stunts and some of the many aerial shots Race doesn't really warrant a trip to the theaters. If the director duo, were woken up in the middle of the night and asked, ""Ultimately, who won the Race?"" They are going to be flummoxed. Or maybe not...they might just say, ""Dude, WE DID!!!"" Because, we, the audience love our cheap thrills and there hasn't been anything glossy around for quite some time. So we will be compelled to flock the box-office. Oh well, so be it.

The action brings more 'laugh out loud's than wows. The twists make your tummy churn instead of making your grey cells work. And yet I have this tingling feeling that the film will do well commercially. Why? Just generally. Like my friend described it, ""Watch it. Leave it."" ","If there is one thing we have learnt from Race it is that you trust no one. No one at all. And that doesn't change in Race 2. Characters make it to Abbas-Mustan's world only if they are conniving. Even the seemingly annoying and trying-to-play-dumb Cherry (Ameesha Patel) is sly in her own way, within her context. This world would have passed of as decent fiction, if only the contrived twists in the tale weren't unending. Each character getting a chance to smirk, ""I knew it. You thought you fooled me?"" or ""I had planted this ploy to put you off-track."" gets tiring. If everyone knows everything, what are we watching the film for? To figure out who knows less? The one-upmanship can keep you intrigued only for so long. Can there be a limit to this when one villain claims everything owned by the other villain to be his, because a profit of 5 billion Euros is not good enough? Even in relative terms, that 5 billion is a 33% profit in 2 days! Fine, I shall control the Chartered Accountant in me. Hey, each of the lead characters look like a million bucks. Or make that a few billion. While I can rant and rage about how awfully distasteful the objectification of women is here, and it is loathsome to say the least, I have to admit that gender equality is maintained in the objectification. John Abraham and Saif Ali Khan are bare-chested long enough. And while the others have to just look like they have an alternate plan of double-crossing on their mind, John Abraham does manage to create that extra amount of scare, for he makes the character he plays, Armaan Malik, look like he'll stop at nothing. If only there was some oomph added in terms of good, memorable dialogue or if the characters were given a little more depth, it would have given something for people like me to chew on. Unpredictability which seems like it exists only to increase the run-time of the film, hasn't done its job well. The chase sequences, the fight (boxing) sequences, the scenic beauty of various exotic locations are all captured very well - right from the close-up of a scorpion to the scorpion shaped party deck to the aqueduct to the mountainous beauty of Europe. But, what's with the shoddy graphics work? From the bullet that leaves a sniper's gun to the airplane in the sky - all one botched up job after another. Unfortunately, there is no X-factor in the songs either. They just all look the same - not just to each other in the film, but across films of this genre which carry glitter, glamour and gleam with pride. No novelty whatsoever.Beautiful looking people with twisted minds. Beautiful locations with crime and more crime. Yet, the potentially beautiful duality gets repetitive and tedious. And as if you hadn't guessed it already, the director duo have given themselves scope to fix it at the third go. Yes, I know not why, but I still hope. Maybe because I hope that some day Saif Ali Khan or Anil Kapoor will wake up from their stupor and will want to deliver quality products they are capable of producing.

Quirky rom-com it is. Same old story told with a slightly interesting narrative style. Not enough to make a movie worth going out for.","Radio comes across as an attempt at comic-strip romance - absolutely unnecessary chapter-divisions and all. I realize the chapter titles were supposed to be funny but they fall flat after the third time they come up on screen. Points can be granted for trying to make the entire look and feel incline towards eccentric. And that was refreshing. But the story was so random that even though it was meant to add to the madness, it didn't quite work. Especially after the funky start, the resilient radio that lasted through a monsoon and played Binaca Geet Mala 30 years ago. Wasn't it Cibaca Geet Mala and aired on Radio Ceylon at that time? Anyways, after the initial interest, the film was all downhill. The repetitions of the meaningless ""it's complicated"" stamp on the chapter title cards got annoying really quick. Oh yes, and how can I forget the ""mann ka radio"" sounding itself off every 8th minute. One of those nice tunes which get annoying just because they stick in your head and just won't go away. Not the tune's fault I guess, but something is wrong if you are irritated with yourself while humming it. So, however intentional the randomness might have been, it ended up only getting annoying and boring by the end. The not-so-great, not-so-bad performances of the cast certainly didn't add to the experience. That it didn't take away anything from it, doesn't say much either.

And story like a thriller should be written.","It is so heartening to see the actors on the top take a few risks and go a little away from the norm. None of the themes are new – be it a sports underdog, based on true life story in Dangal or a revenge thriller in Kaabil or a Robin Hood-esque hero taking on the world in Raees. But, they are decently written and don't have the typical formulaic trappings of Hindi films. Also, you see the stars try their best (even if they don't succeed 100%) to be the characters and not themselves. This is truly heartening. Raees has Shah Rukh Khan play a ragpicker's son called Raees. He has aspirations to be a businessman. Not the suave, stylishly suited, city businessman. He aspires to run a profitable business using his uneducated but street-smart acumen. He wants to do no harm while making his profits. To make him the textbook Robin Hood, the said business has to be illegal, and so it is. The challenges he faces and the solutions he comes up with make Raees an engaging 2+ hour watch.  Every move he makes has a counter-move either by the involved politicians or the honest policeman (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). This makes the web complicated for Raees and claustrophobic for the audience who is egged to support  him, even against the honest policeman. This nexus isn't new to us. We have seen every “star” be a part of this nexus in more than one film. However, the actions and reactions amongst them are relentless through Raees and yet they aren't repetitive. The stakes get higher with each iteration. None of this makes you come to the edge-of-your-seat but you do find yourself taking sides and wondering what the next move will be. You see the ever-so-slight transitions in characters and yet they are consistent with what you would expect of the said character.Shah Rukh Khan slips in and out of being Shah Rukh Khan, but he is more Raees than Shah Rukh Khan at most times. This is despite some very good yet “film-y” lines. It would have been so easy to get carried away and SRK-ise them. But there's restraint and that restraint doesn't glare at you in the face. The rest of the cast isn't gimmicky either. The tribute to this genre of Hindi films from the 80s is obvious including the song placement. However, the style of songs reminded me more of those from 90s. Yet, neither of those are jarring as they were in their times because of the writing. Sure, there are loopholes and there are continuity jerks (especially in some of the action sequences). However, it is just a relief not to be taken completely for granted as the audience. It is a relief to see a formula film play around with the formula. For now, that is good enough. Raees is very unlikely to have a lingering effect, but while you are watching it, you are 100% there. For now, that is good enough.

But it has brilliant performances by both Raj Kumar Yadav and Kainaz Motivala.","Ragini MMS is the same old spooky Hindi, supernatural film. In fact, the first half an hour or so of the film is like you are watching a sleazy, slow B-grade film with crass language and an attempt at overt ""sexual"" scenes. The only thing that stands the film apart from the rest of the films that fall in this bracket is the awesome performances. The one thing that completely cheeses me off is that these ""horror"" films have no real story. They titillate and are repititive. They don't really need a set up because even if you hate the character you don't want such bad things to happen to him. If he's that bad you want the punishment under your control maybe and not some mean and grumpy, old ghost. That's where the film succeeds. Uday Jhalla is a lousy, cheesy, creepy character and you want him to get away from the spirit. Raj Kumar Yadav squeezes every bit of aversion and later pity out of you. Kainaz Motivala too evokes sympathy through her naiveté and helplessness. Despite the bleh first half, some of the spook-inducing decisions made in the second half were freaking awesome. The kind where even 95 minutes seem too long. In this duration it's not because Ragini MMS is a bad film but because you want that claustrophobia to go away. The director has done something right if every time the spirit speaks, my skin crawls. (Or could it be because it kept reminding me of Nandita Das' performance in Chitra Palekar's Marathi film, maati maay""?)You have to be a horror film lover to enjoy this one. Nope, there is no real titillation in terms of the sexual scenes indicated in the promos.Oh yeah, and here is my standard horror-film disclaimer. Basically, I can't handle them.

Ragini MMS 2 is like any other B-grade horror film or Horrex (Horror-Sex for the uninclined) as Ragini MMS 2 likes to call itself. Do not be surprised if I copy-paste this review for the next similarly done film in the genre.Or maybe i should have such a ready review of this nature for each genre. Now, that's a thought.

The 15-20 minutes on song and romance could’ve been used in other ways to highlight sacrifices made by families of honest government employees.","The one thing that sets Raid apart is that it is based on a true life story. If it were not, it could easily be dismissed as yet another idealistic ‘honesty vs. corrupt’, ‘good vs. evil’ story. But, this actually happened. A team of Income Tax Officers showed up at a known corrupt, political goon’s doorstep to conduct a raid based on an anonymous tip. And there wouldn’t have been a story if they didn’t find anything, right? So, there isn’t much of a story to give away. Raid, then does a decent job of building drama while revealing how it all panned out. If only, on its way, it did not fall prey to its misguided effort of doffing its hat to the officers’ families. After you have seen the film, one of the  main things that will stay with you is how the music was a let down. Not only is the background music consistently in your face to fulfill its job description of building drama, but the songs too are disappointing in more than one ways. The music and lyrics are generic but what you really wonder about is why the movie had strewn the songs to lengthen it unnecessarily. Especially considering you know the director has made engaging films without them. It is when the end slides roll that the text on them make you realise the family angle was a way of paying a tribute to the sacrifices made by the officers’ families. And that breaks your heart even more – was superficial and misplaced songs the only way the makers could think of to laud these families?Everything about the relationship between Amey Patnayak (Ajay Devgn) and his wife, Malini (Ileana D'Cruz) is farcical. From the introduction scene where their pillow talk consists of rum-odour, toothpaste and cardamom seeds to her concern about his safety seem forced and extraneous. Without those ending slides, as a seasoned movie-goer, you would know the only reason she is in the film is to fill in as the hero’s weakness. It doesn’t help that Ileana D'Cruz is as monotonous as ever. There’s just no range.On the other hand, while we could say the same thing about Ajay Devgn, there is this one scene where he has to portray Amey’s vulnerability and there is the slightest variation in how his eyes shift and his forehead crinkles. And that one scene made me question the existence of all his action films. Why bother with that when you can do this? However, other than this one scene, he just holds on to that dead-pan expression we are well versed with. It is a good thing then, that some of us cannot have enough of it. Especially, when he is mouthing some very well written lines.The show-stealer though is Saurabh Shukhla. His depiction of corrupt politician, Tauji is on spot. His vulnerability though extraneous to the plot makes his character very interesting. You might not fear Tauji for you aren’t shown much of his tyranny and what he is capable of, but you hate him for his arrogance and want him to lose real bad. This I think is also a win for the choice of subject. You know ₹420 crores in 1981 (approximately $65 million at today’s rates) is a lot of money. But, seeing it pour from all over the place, the sheer volume still shook me up. And then to imagine this is owned by just one family. This is the corruption that seeps into our lives. This is the money that will be misused again after it has been confiscated by the government. The issue of corruption itself has you hooked, has you rooting for Amey evidenced by an applause from the audience watching the film. This is despite the fact that Amey’s in-the-face honesty makes you wonder if he spent all his salary on his wife’s lucknowi saris and dresses and a Rayban for himself. You smile at this and move on because you know corruption is being fought with vigour. It is a shame then that this already engaged frame of mind isn’t capitalised upon. It becomes a regular Ajay-Devgn-plays-honest-guy vs. bad-guy routine. Except of course, that it is based on a true life story.

261,961,961,961,961,[The] Raid 2,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/raid-2-review/,,,,4.0,"The Raid 2 tones down the amount of action from the first film in favour of a stronger plot, but that doesn’t mean that the nature of the action has been toned down in any way. A worthy follow-up to the first film, Gareth Evans serves us yet another possible cult action flick.","Gareth Evans’ 2011 flick, The Raid: Redemption, (which was dubbed into English and released worldwide in 2012,) very quickly became a cult action flick. It had some of the best cable-less action you’ve seen on screen, and had a gritty punch to it that made it a relentless, albeit extremely violent, action entertainer. That film had a threadbare plot, to be honest, but it worked because of just how good the fight scenes were.Evans now takes it a step further, with The Raid 2. The action scenes, in terms of screen-time have been cut down in favour of an actual plot; not one that’s particularly novel, if you think about it, but one that makes for an interesting setting for the high octane action you expect from a sequel to The Raid. Think of it as a Yakuza film on crack.Rookie cop Rama from the previous film, (who miraculously made it out of that film alive!) is now convinced to go undercover to infiltrate and help destroy a crime syndicate that has control over the streets of his beloved city. The mafia, of course, has its own politics at play.If you go in expecting to be hooked to the action from the word go, you’ll be disappointed; because a lot of time is spent establishing the setting and how Rama works his way in and upwards in the crime organization. Evans had a much higher budget this time round, and it shows. In terms of treatment, the film is quite different from its predecessor - smooth and precise camera movements, a multitude of locations, a nice non-linear editing pattern in certain scenes, and an overall superior production quality. The hardcore action scenes are still there, of course, and they’re quite terrific. There is plenty of violent bloodshed, so this film is definitely not for those who aren’t fans of raw violence. Apart from the sprinkling it throughout the film, action fans will be satisfied with what they go in to the film for with just one particular car chase scene in the latter half. It is executed with such imagination and raw energy, that it will leave you salivating. What one misses, however, is the threat of Rama’s cover blowing. The film concentrates so much on the political machinations at play in the crime world that you never really get a sense of danger about the fact that Rama might be discovered for what he truly is. The story lacks a sense of urgency about it. Adding that to the film could truly have taken it someplace else.Personally speaking, I’d have been more than happy to see even more action in the film, because that’s what made The Raid so much fun. Yet, The Raid 2offers enough adrenaline-pumping stuff to keep you hooked, and if you set your expectations right, the plot works as well. Evans has firmly established himself as a genre specialist, and The Raid 3 has already been announced, and will certainly be a film to watch out for.

And yet, despite the dull lines, modern Mahabharat is a tale worth watching.","The wait for a high-octane, all-engrossing drama just became longer. But, that still doesn't mean we don't have a decent watch in hand with Raajneeti. The set-up is certainly complex and intriguing. And there are a couple of sly and conniving twists, no doubt. But, the depth is still missing. It's almost as if introducing the characters and their connections was an end by itself and not merely the beginning nor the means to get there.Given that the characters are based on Mahabharat, it would take real skill to make them uninteresting. So, are all the characters here. In fact, if you focus only on that angle, you'll see even more curious amalgamations. For example, Nana Patekar's character, Brij, is more Krishna, but has shades of Shakuni mama and a little bit of Bheeshma too. Made me think a bit about Krishna's manipulative tactics too. And after a while, these analogies can burst out of their seams. It's best to leave these aside and just watch the film for what it is. It would also help to keep Corleones, Gandhis, and Thackerays at bay. As glaring as they are, they only serve as distractions. And despite so much potential for complexity, the lack of details along with the creativity-challenged treatment offered to some of the situations gives you the heebie-jeebies. And as almost always, the negative lingers longer than the positive. Some of the scenes, like the one in which a character is introduced just after the previous scene alluded to him; or sundry women getting pregnant; or a woman falls in love with the ""arranged"" husband after he respects her wish not to be touched. Such scenes clearly didn't belong here; or the on-the-face references to the mythological epic. Oh yeah, and not to mention the deranged ""item"" number. Also with the various connections and cross-connections, the film deserved a lot more in terms of flow from one sub-plot to another instead of a ""my turn-my turn"" shout-out by the characters whenever they were made missing-in-action for a bit. Then there were other things that didn't go with the tone of the film like say, Prithvi's (Arjun Rampal's) sudden eccentricity. It was almost as if to say Arjun's otherwise wooden facial muscles can be chiseled into this other form - Exhibit A, B, and C presented as proof. To be fair, he was doing a decent job till then. The other usually plastic face is Katrina Kaif. Not in this one, at least in some parts. But all of you who are going to the film to see the surreal vision of the diva in a sari, please pass this one. The bits you see in the promo are almost all of what you'll see in the film too. The film is all about Samar and Ranbir has certainly carried off the chameleon-skinned character well. My complaint though is against the almost Jekyll and Hyde conversion without any symptoms of the disorder. Many of the other actors mostly retain their first expression, despite having fairly gray characters. This almost 3-hour affair doesn't slacken but doesn't keep you waiting for the next move either. Because somehow there's a foregone conclusion given the epic characters the film is based on.

After all, where would you get conflicts, plenty of multi-faceted characters, repressed dreams, struggles to realise those dreams, self-discoveries so readily available? Pretty much a basis for a strong plot, isn’t it? Call this as its beauty or the best part, Rajwade and Sons brims with all of this, and yet it is nothing like any joint family dramas you would probably have bumped into in the recent times. The backdrop of a never-seen-before, super-rich-Marathi-business family sets the tone just right, and more imperatively, non-human elements that both enfolds and drives the central theme. Even so, something just doesn’t feel right as characters emerge. Sooner or later, you realise that’s lack of feeling, your feelings for characters, your feelings for their emotional turbulence and so on.No time is wasted in building the main purpose. From the first frame itself, you get the sense of a family home, its rustiness, long-forgotten memories, the old charm and much more. But as you witness, dwellers find no resonance with you whatsoever. And the abode is already being vacated to facilitate its demolition and construction of an upmarket, residential tower over it. You see the joint family now living separately at a temporary, but plush building. Interestingly, the patriarch of the family wants all the generations to stay under one roof. He is a control freak. Not only does he control his own adult children, but he also governs the future of his young grandchildren. Younger Rajwades are now basking in their newly-found personal space, while older ones – with strong conventional values – can’t come to terms with it.Parents always watch out for their kids, out of genuine concern or an authoritative personality. But the Rajwades are unlike any other, at least thematically. They’re affluent, influential, successful, but conservative, prestige-maniacs, money-minded inwards. This generational conflict is amusing initially and gets intense with the build up. While you mostly side with the younger generation, you also start recognising the cloaked side of the generation in between, their dilemmas, unfulfilled dreams and constraints. When you can’t have your way, you try to figure a way out, if indeed you can. So some characters have dual lives, even as others have no idea what life holds for them. Their situation may not seem as appalling as it sounds, but deep down it affects their mindset and effects their contrasting demeanour. A thoughtful characterisation, I must say.But, the film is neither whole-heartedly funny, nor is it emotionally absorbing – largely related to young guns. I am not too sure if that’s due to certain actors’ inability, directional slip, sound recording or final mixing issues, the dialogue occasionally falls flat and sounds flimsy. It should seem real, rich, and not badly dubbed. The writing can’t be absolved from all blame either, and the highlight being some badly-written, explanatory dialogues. You’re repeatedly told, a certain character is missing. The cause is hammered in. I understand his significance to the narrative. I also understand the importance of information. But, the need for spilling the beans so easily is beyond me.Happy Journey, Kundalkar’s earlier venture, was also about self-discovery. A little too much spoon-feeding and philosophical commentary dampens the latest. Having ideated this brilliant setting, it’s sad that the film doesn’t exploit it to a greater emotional benefit. Don’t make me cry, great if you can, but at least make me feel or root for the characters. Let me feel what it means to reunite with your past. Let me soak in the sorrow of detachment. This state itself is so poetic that you don’t need melodrama to make it overwhelming. Tears will roll down on their own, if you connect. Such a bond is scanty throughout with that said-missing character who tries to push others. He looks so cool, talks so right and (suddenly) becomes so important. Poorly cast, he influences people to let go of things to realise their true calling. This verbal talk is all right, but doesn’t move me even a little.When living characters fail to pull me in, silent ones come to my rescue – leaving me in complete awe of them. The old home, newly-shifted building and future apartment act as a metaphor for the ever-changing face of cities, in this case Pune. Interwoven with care, yet thoughtfully hidden behind, these structures come together as an inborn binding force – making an implicit commentary on our living at large. I have already left the story, its imperfect family behind. But the longing of changing abode is forever going to stay with me.

It has a coherent story, it makes an attempt at character development. Actors rise above the stylization and actually put up a good performance, across the board. Alas, the excess use of slow-motion competes too hard with the story and unfortunately at times the story loses the battle.","When I say excessive use of slo-mo, I don't mean it lightly. ONLY scenes with dialogue reach you at normal speed. All else is in super-slow motion. And there aren't too many dialogues in the first place. I'm not saying I want more dialogues, just trying to warn you that almost 85% of the film is in slow-motion. Oh and first 20-25 minutes are a recap of the first episode. The good thing is you become a more patient person at the end of these 2.5 hours. To lend you support is a story with enough meat to do the rounds. The birth and death of crime are a never-ending circle, especially crime that is fuelled by revenge - be it in a small village in Andhra Pradesh or a nameless society. Whatever the case, it's high time the people involved step out of the circle to see the sunshine - is what Ram Gopal Verma tried to say in Rakht Charitra Part 1 and continues to do so in part 2, only with more conviction. There are actions and reactions based on defined characters. When some characters see murder as the one and only solution for any kind of problem, you see with more clarity (compared to part 1) that these people haven't known any other way. They are not politicians to judge pros and cons, they are just driven by an ego that bears the tag of a fanatic. The story also did away with a few characters that were annoying in part 1 - Any mention of Bukka (even in the recap) and the lady police inspector were conspicuous by their absence. This convinces me even more that  Bukka's meaningless violence, which was so prominent in Part 1, was absolutely gratuitous. The women too gain some respect, they have and speak their mind. They also give some brilliant performances. And so does...ahem...Vivek Oberoi, ditto for Suriya. I would have liked to see more of the Inspector Mohan character, but he just walked in and out as Suriya's inner voice/soul. I think these acts were accentuated because of the slow-motion too. I don't know if it's an illusion of some kind, but the close-ups and slow-motion combination give an impression that the actor has held on to one expression long enough for me to appreciate it. Damn! I already mentioned the slo-mo dramatizing everything. Saying it here will tantamount to repetition, right? I'm tempted to say here that with Bukka's role cut out and the slow-motion done in regular speed here (even half the number of times) would have easily made one good film. Synergy any one? Or is that Cinergy?Never mind, there's always the camerawork in RGV films to complain about. This time the camera does circles - no, not the standard horizontal ones, vertical ones. For good 20-25 seconds at a stretch, with no rhyme or reason. The first time, I almost thought something had gone wrong with the relay. ""An eye for an eye, makes the whole world blind."" Been there, seen that. Way too many times. Next. Oh wait, the climax here does leave a door open for a part 3.

That might just be because the only story that happens, is in that span. The first 120 minutes is someone killing the other in a ""brutality"" competition. Yeah, only an optimist like me can find a positive in that one.","This review is a tribute to all my friends who complain that reviews here don't tell them about the story.Once upon a time, there lived a little boy called Bukka. The trauma of having a weird name was the first scar on his mind. It was only symbolic of what would seem like a troubled childhood. The other damage to his brain was caused by the creepy voiceover narrator who told him bedtime stories. Bukka made his nightmares real for others, in their actual life. When boys and girls his age were learning to color within the lines, he looked for creative ways of spurting blood out of big, fat black ants. It wouldn't be a surprise if we found out that his father actually designed new instruments for him to hone his skill. These toys were why he loved his father. The only person he ever loved. (yeah, yeah, you are at the right place. This is the review of Rakht Charitra I)As he grew older, he graduated to frogs, rats, and eventually humans. Such was Bukka's love for killing in new ways that, when one of his men was found dead, he would get disgusted with how clichéd the murdering style was, and kill one or two of his own henchmen, because they happened to be around. He never needed a reason to kill. His father, Nagmani Reddy, usually had someone handy to serve as specimen. Nagmani was a politician. Nagmani was an insecure, second-wrung politician. Nagmani was led by an easily-influenced, pawn politician, another Reddy. Other Reddy politician had a trusted rightman Veerbhadra. Now at this point (which is 7-10 minutes into the film), if I think hard, I'm sure I'll remember who offended whom and then killed whom. And there was always someone or the other who wanted revenge. But, I'm not too inclined to stress my memory. Because I don't think Ram Gopal Varma/Prashant Pandey care much about that. Their only intention is to set a clear stage for the next Rakht Charitra threatening to knock our doors in exactly 4 weeks. But he still had these 2 hours to fill before he could get there. So, he has put up an exhibition of the goriest gore possible. And shed all pretentions of giving us reason. Unfortunately, so impressed was he with his own output that he just added the last 15 minutes to make whatever happened thus far, redundant. While I have begun enjoying gore to a certain extent (so what if I still squirm), I'm a happy child if there's meaning and story behind it. And this is what happened in the last 15-30 minutes. The story presents such an interesting 'what if' for the sequel that I had to bump the rating up by a bit. Though the glimpses felt like it will just have more of the same. Else, Rakht Charitra is to pulp action, what David Dhawana/Priyadarshan comedies are to slapstick - brainless, story-less, motivation-less. Ps. In this world of gore, don't assume there is no place for women. Albeit the only two functions they have are to serve as objects to satisfy lust or to cry and feed for their men. Pps. I have a question. If Aakrosh can get into trouble for derogatory remarks against CBI officials , how come no one is bothered about the practical absence of law enforcement agencies in Rakht Charitra?Ppps. Oh yeah, the actors they all growl and widen nostrils very well! The background music growled and the camera looked like it had nostrils that wanted to widen them beyond their capacity. O-kay enough nonsense!

The characters are not etched out at all and have plain bad dialogues. It is sad to think of Babban as Amitabh Bachchan instead of the other way around. Others are all pretty bad too. The villain of the movie is the cameraman. Just because some person got a camera, why should the audience suffer a headache!? Bahut na-insaafi hai...","You have an inkling of the director's self-indulgence as soon as you have heard of the title. And frame after frame you are just sitting there confirming that this man is just obsessed with himself, and of course his camera. Or the camera has possessed him. I was keen on sticking to a promise I made to myself a few months ago - control your urge to compare, and just enjoy the remake. But I was forced to give up when avoiding the parallels required way too much focus and started giving me a headache. Instead of narrating the story Ram Gopal Varma seemed to be solely concerned with changing the nitty-gritty of the original. You cut off hands, I think the story is better told if just fingers are chopped!?...You had a dialogue that is remembered 30 years later, I think a silence works better...You had a silence here, I think long-drawn dialogues over three scenes work better. Where’s the creativity? Where's the much talked about interpretation?None of the characters are fleshed out. All come across as superficial and their motivations unclear. The actors are plainly regurgitating their utterly uninteresting dialogues. Most of the characters are dull and plain. Even Amitabh Bachchan is more Amitabh Bachchan than Babban (his character). In fact, Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prshant Raj) have almost identical characters except that they fall in love with different types of girls. It's sad when ""style"" is shown through use of the word in the lyrics instead of oozing out of the character.Oh wait! What am I talking about!? There is one strong character in the movie who wants to make sure you notice its personality - the camera. It is just all over the place, trying its best to steal the show. This behavior is getting progressively worse with every RGV product. And it is so even in the simplest of scenes. So, imagine what a treat they gave themselves in the action sequences. I hope the choreographer wasn't paid too much, because the camera was doing all the dancing. Amit Roy (cinematographer) must be such a tired person. He seriously needs a break - a long one. And he might as well take Amar Mohile with him, for he must be worn out cranking up the volume of his background score too. It also looks like there were huge date problems with the cast.  There are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together (way too many over the shoulder shots and close-ups). This gives very little room for the chemistry, if any, between the characters to reach the audience. Okay, before I go on and on about the cameraman and the director...let's call it quits here (Huge hint to Ramu & his factory workers!)Sholay? Nope, it is NOT Sholay. Sholay had detailed characters played by unforgettable actors, dialogues to die for, brilliant sense of humor, good music, a kick-ass background score, etc, etc, etc. Just shifting location from Ramgadh to Mumbai and festivals from ""Holi"" to ""Diwali"" with a full-of-life cameraman ain't going to help no one.

Just might be.","From love at first sight to till-death-do-us-part style, crazy love via the banter and misunderstandings that any relationship goes through - Ram-Leela has it all, in gorgeous frames, amongst lots of song and dance. That also makes it predictable, long and over-dramatized. For a better part of the first half Ram-Leela is completely engaging. The set-up is intriguing, the language brash and earthy, the characters draw interest and of course it is all very pretty. What also happens hand-in-hand though is that everything is a little overdone. For example, the songs are breathtakingly beautiful but go on for a  little too long; I actually laughed out loud at an innuendo and then it is stretched further to kill the joke; similarly the characters, at least the side characters, get a little too repetitive. The two central characters though keep you hooked - for the first hour. It is difficult to say whether that is because of the vivacious performances, or the strong-minded characters, or the chemistry between the lead pair or just that they look jaw-droppingly beautiful, or their colorful costumes or lack thereof. Or it could be just that you are soaking in the atmosphere. Or all of the above - you are hooked. Even so much so that you overlook the implausibility of it all.  You enter the fairytale, alright.The side characters too, hold their own both in terms of performances and the screen space they are given. Gulshan Devaiah and Richa Chadda have nicely layered characters - especially considering they are a part of a large canvas and there are many small characters to share the space with. Similarly, given how uni-dimensional Supriya Pathak's character is, she does a pretty decent job of instilling fear. Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone themselves are oozing oomph. At the same time, their presence is more than that. The pulsating sexual tension between them isn't a regular feature in Hindi films. Ranveer Singh is creating quite a space for himself as a romantic lead hero. Deepika Padukone too, not only looks prettier by the day but also engages as a performer. After that first hour though, because of the impact of how the film began, you wait for something more and better to happen. Unfortunately, the film pretty much takes the route you predicted at the end of this first hour. Other than the overall love angle, the story tries to touch upon a current social issue. But, it comes out of nowhere and doesn't get too much attention in the main scheme of things, later.  It thus, ends up looking like an afterthought. Sure, there are a few twists that you sit up to, but the impact fizzles out, because again it is either long-drawn or melo-dramatized by slow motion. These things only slow down the proceedings towards a climax that you know all about. There's loads of  violence too and some of it gory. While it does become all about one shooting the other shooting the one, there were a couple of chase sequences that I really liked - despite the slow-motion. The sound design and choreography is slick. In fact, each frame is picture perfect, the lighting in each frame looks divine. But, that is the very least you expect from a Sanjay Leela Bhansali film, right? And I can watch almost any film of his for just that atmosphere.  Even though, he goes all masala on you this time, barely clad men, women with backless blouses in a conservative set-up, item number and all! If you can too, you just might not mind Ram-Leela. Once, any way.

Can that mean anything good at all?,"A father and his business partner egg the daughter to get a rich relative's son attracted to her. It sounds sleazier when they say it in Hindi. A mother of today's day and age, who has lived in Australia for years together doesn't once consider asking her son if he likes the girl she has chosen for him before giving her word to the girl's family. Even if such people exist in real life, what makes them interesting? Why would I want to watch them? I didn't like it back in the 90s, I can't stand it now.Even so, Ramaiya Vastavaiya does manage to bring a few smile, or laughs even, with Girish Kumar and his buffoonery. He brings about a childlike cuteness in his character, Ram. The kind of cutesy behaviour that is pretty annoying when an adult does it, but Girish Kumar carries it off quite a few times. And of course, there are other times when it doesn't work at all.Unfortunately, those other times pretty much make for the entire film. Ramaiya Vastavaiya is almost continuously trying really hard to be funny. It goes over the top, loud and unbearable at most times. There are a few instances with the lead pairs sidekick's becoming butt of jokes. Or another character whose always on the phone and his side of the conversation is a funny remark on another parallel dialogue in the scene. All of this too though, works for a while and then it gets repetitive and thus stops being funny.Given that the situation of all villains being against the hero's love for his lady, by itself is nothing very exciting, it is marginally interesting that Ramaiya Vastavaiya has more than one villain, all with supposedly powerful personalities. So, you feel the hero getting cornered from all sides. But, what's the point if the most intimidating one backs off, just like that. Not even a courtesy couple of lines are lectured on to them to transform their take. The problem with love stories like Ramaiya Vastavaiya is that they fail to convince you of the undying love that the lead pair feels for each other. It is more like you are asked to believe they are so much in love rather than you feeling it. So, who are you going to root for? Certainly not for the woman who can't watch out for herself even when her life is at stake. Shruti Haasan as damsel-in-distress works only as much as any stereotypical damsel-in-distress would work.It's disheartening to see a film that mimics films made in the 90s. Especially, when you feel the ones in the 90s shouldn't have been made in the first place!

Unfortunately for the film and fortunately for the viewers you get comfortable with the discomfort. If it were not for Nawazuddin Siddiqui's spine-chilling performance, Raman Raghav 2.0 wouldn't have had much of an impact. The story by itself barely has any material beyond its one-line plot. The big reveal would either be predicted by seasoned movie-goers or will seem too contrived when it comes about for those who didn't guess it before hand. Either way, it holds no charm or shock despite the fact that the concept by itself is thought provoking. The “psycho” element in this psycho-thriller comes a little too late, even if it is not too little. The rest of the film has no movement, neither is the slow pace arresting. Each sequence functions as an additional proof of how brutal Raman (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) is. It is nerve-wrecking. It is scary. But it goes on for tad too long. Even so, for fans of the actor, the director or the genre, there is enough to keep you in your seats. You might or might not remember much after you leave it though.

Makes you question how many childhoods have we lost to the Indo-Pak issue.,"You can look at it as yet another heartbreaking story about several nameless prisoners on each side of the Indo-Pak border. Or you can look at it as a moving story of one family affected by the injustice embedded in the situation. Either way its a movie that touches you.
A few years of Ramchand Pakistani's life is so sensitively narrated that it manages to completely absorb you for those 100-odd minutes. His journey starts with him as any other 8-year old, immature child who vies for his mom's attention and considers his dad as competition. But the situation he lands himself in leaves him no option but to connect with his father. That marks a start to their bitter-sweet relationship. From a scared, anxious little boy Ramchand grows into a hardened, defiant young man who just moves on with life as it comes. 
The move is as much about the situation as it is about the bonds Ramchand forms - with his mother, father, the police officer, and other prison inmates. None of this would have come through without one wonderful performance after another. Especially, Nandita, whose pride in her honour will not let anyone pity her despite her dire situation. Without a single word her anguish, her confusion at why she's been dealt such a lousy hand, and her willingness to move on with life, reach us.Like the flute playing in the background, other subtle things keep the story balanced. The story is about a Hindu family living in Pakistan and a couple of them end up in an Indian jail with a kind Muslim jailer. The treatment towards the untouchables, the torture in prisons, child abuse by jail inmates, extortion of money-lenders - all are depicted without hitting hard. The aim is clearly to talk of a situation without pointing fingers and not to sensationalize. 
Just because people get used to whatever crap life offers them, does it mean we should let them happen? - It asks ever so quietly without letting gloom overwhelm you.

But this ain't a bad start for bold topics at all.","Rang Rasiya is bold. Not just because of the one scene with sex and nudity, but also because of the theme(s) it picks on and the narrative they've chosen to depict the concepts. For that itself, Rang Rasiya could be watched by an avid film buff. However, beyond that, it comes across as a mish-mash of themes, all trying to have their say and none getting enough space to do it. Randeep Hooda as a misunderstood, controversial painter is a strong lead. I have come to love his choice of films and his growing strength as a performer. Sure, he still comes across as repetitive across films with his brooding characters. But, Rang Rasiya gives him a little more width for expression and he thrives. Nandana Sen is gorgeous and gives her character the fullest too. For once, the lead lady character in a Hindi film is used for her body, and yet it doesn't look sleazy or doesn't seem like objectification. The credit for that of course goes to the writing and the story. Unfortunately though, the chemistry between the two leads seems forced. The intimate scenes though much more explicit and thus seemingly more natural also come across as self-conscious. In fact, that can be said about the film as a whole.The makers are very aware that they are trying something different, and while it is not pretentious of self-consumed, the awareness shows. This doesn't let me get involved as an audience. Also, the narrative is too episodic thus not allowing a smooth flow from one scenario into another. That fluidity is of utmost importance to a film that attempts to be so poetic. And this film, for its subject matter deserves to be poetic too. For one, it is set in a period more than 100 years ago. That era lends itself to romanticization on its own, which wasn't capitalised on completely. To top it off, you have a painter who wishes to express things that the world around him is not ready for. What more could lend itself to lyricism in a film?Also, this alone was good enough to make for a full length feature film. However, issues related to gender roles, freedom, value of art and the creator, philanthropy, religion and more are brought into the realm creating a potpourri that doesn't blend well together. Not to mention, each thread feels like it is left midway. I am all for open-ended stories, but this seemed a unintentional. I would still watch Rang Rasiya, for what it's trying to do. The hope is that as there are more and more bold themes, these creases will be ironed out to give us a wholesome, less self-aware film. Till then, this is a decent enough start.

275,975,975,975,975,Rangaa Patangaa,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review,/movie/rangaa-patangaa-review/,,,,3.8,Scores really high only to turn into stereotypical. ,"There is this lovely qawwali that my mind just refuses to get over - such a refreshing score! Firstly because, words that drift along are perhaps as serene and, contrastingly, mordant as Rangaa Patangaa’s visual tone. And secondly because, it leaves me isolated from narrative flow, while growing on me at different crossroads. However, I found the use of words quite a inconsistent. Every stanza begins in Urdu, and concludes with Marathi verses, so on and so forth. Beautiful pieces of writing in themselves, they appear to be constrained just as Marathi characters stereotyped in Hindi films and vice versa. Staying true to this classic mishap, but surely not to a pathetic extent, we have a Muslim farmer born and brought up in Varhadi-speaking Vidarbha region of Maharashtra.Right from the word go, there are tons of reasons to enjoy Makarand Anaspure play this strong-willed yet humble, straightforward yet stuck in complexities sort of personality. Now it’s a cliché to describe Anaspure’s grip over regional dialects, his look and costumes help bring more authenticity to the role. He might still have traces of Makarand Anaspure, but gratefully doesn’t perform like one. In this character-driven path, he lives a part probably he hasn’t in his entire career. With a mild dose of Varhadi and spoilt Hindi, this cinematic realism gets down to do real business. Where and how it ends up isn’t something new to our cinema. It is just that the ‘failure-to-buildup’ syndrome claims a promising subject this time.His dearest bulls Rangaa and Patangaa are missing from the barnyard. They could have been stolen, he is not sure. But he knows they’re not lost. Animals remember their way back home more than humans do, he echoes. Disappointments are all over in his pursuits. Farming is at stake as well. But, livelihood takes a back seat to the apparent parenthood. Farmers see cattle as individuals and not a mere production utility, treating them the same way as their kids. Our guy has no children of his own, so the animal bonding is stronger here. This makes his heartbreak completely palatable. He hasn’t lost hope as yet, nor has his wife. Nandita Dhuri, in her carefree salwar kameez, looks apt for this role opposite Anaspure. But neither sound apt. They argue in such a calculated and deliberate tone that both seem to pretend. Occasional Hindi, occasional Varhadi or even Marathi follows without being free-wheeling. The attempt is there, but doesn’t really materialise.The emotional piece, played early on along with opening credits, flunks in empathising with the character’s state. It could also be because the narrative is at a very early stage to make that happen. Although it doesn’t take a chunk out of an already tiny timeline, it doesn't reach out to you. Drought has already broken him from within. But, the latest loss is unimaginable. Police’s inaction takes him into further despair. Scouting with his childhood friend too goes in vain. This treatment is cleverly balanced with humour. Satire keeps you involved with the mood as nothing goes in the characters’ favour. So far so good. A young, dynamic television journalist visiting his village crosses paths with him. He instantly takes the issue on – not that it really bothers him, but because he finds the story better than the usual drought and farmers’ suicide reporting.The farmer himself sees no hope, but it instantly turns into a statewide issue thanks to our notorious media furore. This actually becomes a point where outside elements step in and the subject is made to take a back seat. Rangaa Patangaa is essentially a satire interlaced with farmer’s stories, problems and their age-old questions that still remain a question. It makes a mockery of journalistic standards, TRP-oriented stories, politics and more, while shading light on illegal cattle trading, bull castration, greed, casteism, among others. These fundamental issues remain only at face value, because the media frenzy has taken over already. Nothing matters henceforth, not even the replayed music. Portraying media’s immaturity for humorous reasons is all right, but not staying true to the real subject is criminal. Ironically, former journalist Anusha Rizvi’s exemplary Peepli Live still leads by example.All’s well that ends well, and I couldn’t disagree more with respect to this film. Negligent politicians, greedy mediamen are certainly way too stereotypical for a film of Rangaa Patangaa’s class (the intended one). But in contrast, the climax misses everything big time! A pure piece of junk, it should’ve been cut out, if not, left unwritten altogether. The music really worked for me here because it came at a time when the visuals lose their voice.In a career full of mostly forgettable films, it probably took some 22 years for Anaspure to get a brilliantly-designed role; and how he lives up to the deman! This is, by far, his most superior film, yet it is not so well-made. This also happens to be writer-director Prasad Namjoshi’s better work, even though it is written shoddily. The other film he wrote (two years ago), Kapus Kondyachi Goshta also releases alongside, and is even more mundane. What a moment to cherish and what an outcome to forget!

Even so, the writing though has miles to go. ","Boy meets girl. Uninteresting. But that changes quickly if the circumstances they meet under are intriguing. That the boy and girl fall for each other is a given. But their conflicts with the rest of the world can charge things up. Rangoon does this in fits and starts. That too is enough to keep you glued. The house of cards falls though when the story has to be wrapped up. The last 20-25 minutes of Rangoon are a fine example of out-of-characteristically abysmal writing. Something that was meant to break your heart, makes your eyes roll instead with a mind that's crying, “et tu, Bharadwaj?”A story is supposed to answer a, “What if?” “What if Quentin Tarantino made Inglourious Basterds as a musical.” Rangoon, the film - not its story – tries to answer that question in the first half hour. As intentional as the nod to Tarantino is, this interesting and amusing “what if”, is not one that takes the plot forward. Then there are other musical pieces that remind you of Gulaal. I am not sure if that was intentional. But, the comment on the clash of political ideologies is apparent.  And anyway, it doesn't take the story forward.Now considering Rangoon encompasses a love triangle, a war of ideologies and the World War II, it is a lot of time spent on not moving the story forward. This is why, the last half hour becomes a little more tedious than it might have been with fewer tangents. However, another way to look at it would be that the three characters who make the triangle are so intriguing that you want to see more of them. Each one of them is strong-headed. Each one of them helpless in love. Each of them grey and complex. Yes, surely we want more of them.Of course, that wouldn't have worked out had it not been for the actors. Saharsh Shukla to Satoru Kawaguchi to the lead actors Kangna Ranaut, Saif Ali Khan, Shahid Kapoor – all are remarkable. The lead actors specifically make their vulnerabilities transparent to the audience's eye. The actors' eyes showing strength and power to defy that vulnerability even as they succumb to the ones they love. Yet, they are not clones of each other.  Even if the intensity with which they love might be the same – if love can be measured at all, that is – the priorities change with time and situation. And because of the way it is played out by the actors, as an audience, you can tell how they are going to react. This has a feeling of being consistent with the character rather than predictable. The chemistry between Shahid Kapoor and Kangna Ranaut is palpable, that between the latter and Saif Ali Khan is appropriately cold or comfortable. If you were to strip down the tangents, this story is about stunt-woman Julia. Sure, a character of such strength, especially physical, is usually a male in most films. That highlight aside, what made it even more precious is almost everything about the story is about two women – Julia and India. Ironically, many a love triangle with two men and a woman are more about the men than the woman. Many a film about patriotism are more about the men protecting the country and very little about the country herself. The women on the pedestal are taken rather for granted in the story. A lot of Rangoon is about Julia, her experiences and her reactions to those experiences. There is a psychological undercurrent of her nomadic beginnings leading to an insecurity she hides within. The countries too are given some consideration, through foreign rulers admiring the rich culture, through acts on stage. Other than that the non-glamorous war and action scenes (barring a few badly done CGI ones), the scenes without a background score, the music when it's there, the songs, the long shots and close-ups all take you into their world. A world strife with war. And yet looks like a beautiful scar on an otherwise untainted body. A war within which love finds vigour. A world where Vishal Bharadwaj tries to enter Shakespearean territory of tragic, complex characters - irrespective of whether or not he succeeds completely. A world I would certainly visit again. Maybe with a pen in hand, even if imaginary, scratching off parts from the reel that would have made the movie crisper. Maybe coming back home imagining an alternate end for the film.

Yet, it takes the events to extremes towards the end, makes it too long and loses the plot. Some witty dialogue and a few well-timed performances keep the interest alive in an otherwise uneven second half. ","Deep friendships. Friends that take advantage of you. We all have at least a couple of both types. Rangrezz makes a  brave effort at showing you both the sides unlike what you are used to seeing in Bollywood. Unfortunately, it slacks of at times and takes the easier beaten-down route to redeem itself a little later - leading to a very uneven second half and an extremely dissatisfying conclusion.Rangrezz starts off with a collage of beautiful Mumbai monsoons in a heavily grey, tone pretty much resembling Mumbai what it looks like in the season. My surprise began with those initial shots. A little later when the colors and unwarranted close-ups come in, I was back to being comfortable because the movie began looking like what I had expected. And yet again, I was pleasantly being pulled into the set-up - the characters, the relationships, the wit and charm. Some of the dark humor really took the cake. This involvement was rudely disrupted with songs. Once the mandatory numbers were done with, the meat of the story began and was engagingly narrated to a wonderful peak at interval. After the break too, there are a few very interesting twists that catch you off-guard. Amazingly enough, they are not that largely unpredictable that you feel cheated. You see signs of the twist earlier, only that you don't think too much of it. Only problem though is these twists are balanced off with equally inane and typical turn of events. This wavelike movement in the writing gets more and more annoying and is completely blotched up at the end. Thankfully, the dialogue end of the writing department has taken its job very seriously and has come with some hilarious and witty lines. Completely supported by able delivery to whom most of them are given - Vijay Verma (Pakkya) and Rajpal Yadav (Maa). Jacky Bhagnani's dubbing is off which doesn't help his attempts to emote. I broke up laughing at a supposedly intense scene because Jacky Bhagnani is speaking and yet the camera is at an uncharacteristically, safe, crane top angle. The women are mostly redundant - they are either snubbed down or over-protected by the men around. Amongst the rest of the cast Amitosh Nagpal (Winu), Lushin Dubey (Mrs. Chaturvedi) and Pankaj Tripathi (Pande) leave an impression, especially considering the limited screen-time they have. The wonderful bit is that some of these characters stick and entertain despite being caricatures - more so Vijay Pakkya, Maa and Mrs. Chaturvedi. Or even the cute, petite grandmom. Another bit, I really enjoyed about Rangrezz are a couple of main threads being left unresolved in a very matter of factly manner. It's great that the makers decided to keep some details out, especially considering that the film is already a little too long. (Why not cut the songs out!)Unfortunately, Rangrezz insists on becoming a message film. The extremity and intensity with which the film is narrated almost makes you wonder if it is autobiographical - because some events are too off the chart to be imagined. Yet, Rangrezz ends up making you wonder about people and relationships. So, many turn of events in the film, do make you nod - ""yep, as unbelievable as it looks, it does happen."" Maybe, it's because I didn't expect such maturity from a Jacky Bhagnani film, preconceptions be hailed! But, I am looking forward to the next Priyadarshan film, just in case he decides to go the whole length and make a film that is not bogged down by the need for songs or being filmy.

Ace, touching performance by Big B tries its best to win the war against an interesting yet predictable plot. ","Utopia exports a TV channel to Delhi. But of course, the earthlings contaminate the empire. And we are then taken into the world of the mean media industry. If the spate of films in the ""exposé"" genre are anything to go by, we, the audience, either know everything that needs to be known or being fooled to believe that that's all there is to these industries. Rann is another such example. Had it not been for a couple of the performances and a couple of points where the story could take an interesting turn, the film would have completely collapsed. Also, had the 'background music files' and 'camera angle schedule' of Rann not been exchanged with director Ram Gopal Verma's horror film, Phoonk, Rann would have been immensely watchable and hearable. (Can't even give you the virtual ""eye-roll"" cause my eyes hurt.) And yet the two pillars that the film stands on are enough to make it an interesting watch. Amitabh Bachchan as the composed, honest, serious, intelligent TV channel owner, Vijay Malik, makes you want to look out for him. And it hurts to see his head hang in shame. What a brilliant actor! It is so refreshing to see Riteish Deshmukh as the serious, almost mute Purab, a rookie journalist soaking in how the business-politics-media nexus works. More power to the makers of this casting decision. Next in line, Sudeep as Jai Vijay Malik, did well in his first five minutes of screen time, after which his role didn't demand anything new. Paresh Rawal in yet another caricature role makes the evil grin as tolerable as it can be. What hurt is the roles shelled out to the women. Especially, Gul Panag. What was the point of doing a role which made no contribution except shrieking like any third Hindi film actress? Neetu Chandra's character was so annoying that it's amazing the boyfriend she's nagging didn't murder her in the middle of the film. Can't blame any of them for bad writing, but certainly raised a question or two about script decisions by the ladies. However, Suchitra Krishnamurty's role was a bit meatier but at the end of it all she's only another man's pawn. (Her character reminded me a lot of Rakhee's character, Geeta in Trishul)Interestingly, it's not that RGV was making a masala flick. Then why such shoddy writing for the women. As  is, the overpowering existence of one-dimensional characters (other than the music and camera) is a hurdle to let the film take you over. Yet, while you don't expect any better from the black sheep, the dilemma and emotions that a couple of the white sheep go through are extremely engaging. And ultimately if you as an audience are happy when the white one does the ""right thing"" the writer/director/both have gotten something right. That is over and above the performance. There are points in the film that a question lingers, ""what will this character do?"" ""How will he crack this one?"" Only unfortunately, he takes the most obvious path and you laugh at yourself for letting your brain work in top gear. You set your thoughts aside, another story - another day. Meanwhile, the dialogue is crisp and topical. While I could have easily done without the over-preachy middle portion of one of the channel head's speech, the beginning and the end were well written and beautifully performed. And then comes a shoddy climax that shakes you out of your reverie. Oh well. So, nothing new. Same old brigade against still camera by cinematographer Amit Roy. Same old spooky score in the background. Same old trying to tell a story of the insides of an industry and telling us what we already know. And still wondering why the characters were struck by shock. I hope there are people who like Rann more than I did, and there is a radical movement of sorts that will make the media more responsible. BUT, in case that doesn't happen there's still, some masterwork in the acting department and a partially interesting thread of plot, to make the film worth your time.

The other kind of humor involves guys ogling at cleavage - what is that actually supposed to do? Make you laugh, titillate you, warm you up to the owner of the cleavage? Speaking of which, my hands started hurting with the number of times Kangna Ranaut is pulled from Sanjay Dutt by Ajay Devgn only to be pulled right back by Sanjay Dutt. Imagine the number of times they must've done that while shooting those pulling-and-pushing scenes. And the forced hugs that Kangna Ranaut gets from Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgn after she is pulled makes the two heroes of the film look like lecherous, sleazy, old men that any woman would avoid with a barge pole. Why then is she tolerating this nonsense? There's a reason for it all, supposedly. A reason that only makes you wonder, ""Really? There was no other way to get to the two fools now, was there?"" Oh sorry, how would the writers be able to write all the skin-show and other rubbish in? And well, it is only me who can complain about missing logic and question supposedly existing logic in a David Dhawan film. Like any other David Dhawan film, Rascals made me laugh once or twice. It also immediately took the fun away by characters explaining the joke just cracked or stretching it for an extra 5-10 seconds. And that can be said about the film too. You think it's over and there comes more and then some more and then finally the closing credit song. And you know the scary bit? There seems to be a hint at a sequel.

280,980,980,980,980,Ratatouille,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma reviewNotepad1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/ratatouille-review/,,5/5.0,,3.7,,"I have never been a fan of animation films; somehow I find them “squeaky” in terms of the animation and the sound, and I have so far judiciously avoided them.  A friend of mine insisted that we go for this movie, and so off we went, me with a mild sense of unease, but determined to endure the movie stoically.  However, the film turned out to be more than a pleasant surprise; it was about something that I absolutely adore - food.  The last film I saw on food was Chocolat, which used food as a metaphor for sexuality, freedom, and community, and starred Johnny Depp and Juliet Binoche.  Ratatouille is the name of a rustic French dish made from eggplant, onions, and zucchini, and the film uses the dish as a symbol to send out a clarion call to return to a more romantic age, when maternal love, tenderness, and affection were what made a tasty dish, rather than sophisticated culinary skills.  The film then expands this point by stating that food and cooking needs to be democratized and demystified as expressed in Gusteau’s (the Master Chef in the film) motto: “Anybody can Cook!”Food, and the process of its preparation, is seen as an everyday, easily accessible method for realizing the creative potential inherent in all humans.  The struggle that Remy (the lead character who is a rat) faces to become a chef symbolizes his creative aspirations, and underlines the point that one’s class and caste do not necessarily limit what one can become.  Mastery of the mystery of food is the badge that allows Remy to move beyond his social background.  In turn Remy is considered a weirdo by his fellows for his interest in cooking food, rather than just scavenging on whatever is available.  The film also takes potshots at frozen foods and fast foods, and the current fascination with them, primarily due to notions of “convenience” and “time and money saving”.  Being a Disney film, the rats are made to look as anthropomorphic and cute as possible. But for the viewer, the concept of food cooked by rats being delicious and better than human cooked food may be a bit too much for the palate. (Remember the rats in the kitchen, uggh!)  Food for human beings is fundamentally concerned with purity; food is pure when it is cooked by members of our own social group and becomes impure and disgusting when it is cooked by the Other (people who do not belong to our social group.)  The rats then embody this Otherness, which is very difficult to digest! (Pun after bad pun!)Cooking food is also represented as an unconscious process, a process that does not really involve conscious thought, but something else that combines intuition, sensory delight, discipline, and a celebration of life and romance; it is something that you have, not something that necessarily can be acquired.  If you are a food lover, watch this film. If you are not, do still watch it.  This film is a succulent dish with a light spicy flavour!  Bon Appetit!  And remember to take the family along - after all what is food without family!

281,981,981,981,981,Razzakar,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review,/movie/razzakar-review/,,,,3.7,Poor writing and equally tame portrayal make for sheer boredom.,"Period films and voiceovers presumably share unbridled equation in our industry. If its unwritten rulebook is anything to go by, such a film has to carry a salute of some star’s voiceover in the beginning. I had assumed this well before entering the cinema hall. However Razzakar follows in others’ footsteps rather disappointingly. I honestly have no grudge against it (consider Queen for example), but this badly abused narrative clearly signals the lack of creative force behind the storytelling.Let’s not talk about the film’s idea here - it’s a clear-cut portrayal of the Hyderabad Liberation Movement that erupted in 1948. Razzakars are a private militia formed by the Nizam of Hyderabad, said to have tortured and brutally killed thousands of people who supported the state’s merger with the dominion of India. The film, however, chooses not to get into this multi-layered political crisis. It instead depicts a village’s and most importantly protagonist's struggle against the Razzakars – which is fair enough. Possibly being Razzakars’ early representation in Marathi cinema, a lot was riding on it. The film disappoints not in parts, but in every possible way. Although what saddens me more is its failure to get its act right even at a relatively smaller scale.Characters that drive the screenplay are themselves written so amateurishly – let alone their portrayal – that the whole film appears forcible throughout. The done-to-death recurrence of – three, elderly villagers discussing the arrival of Razzakars into the village or a freedom fighter wanting to be a martyr in any given situation or a man whose jaw is wide open every now and then – make for regrettable hilarity. But above all, the unwarranted instillation of a love story signifies immature writing-direction rather evidently. Every other character performs erratically for no apparent reason causing confusion.A hen binding the story together is simply outstanding, though I am unconvinced with its shoddy depiction. The director fails to make the most of this hen to intensify his antagonist (Zakir Hussain) in the opening scene, making him appear flat rather than fearsome. The makers do resort to a number of comic moments to hold your attention, the lack of conviction though deadens it.Another crucial aspect that bothers me as much as the film’s script is its not-so-terrifying violence. Razzakar is about Hyderabad’s burning past; and despite having on-screen violence involving countless killings, homes set on fire, bloodshed or throat-slitting, it looks half-baked. The so-called goriness, mostly tried through visual effects, just doesn’t evoke emotions.Inferior production design is another low point in the film. After all, it’s very hard coming to terms with symmetrically-well-designed houses, plastic mini flags or glossy flags in 1948. This could also have to do with the film’s story not offering any creative room to deepen its otherwise dull setting.Historic films are nowadays doing what history textbooks did in school. Both end up boring you, regardless of boasting adventurous moments.I couldn’t connect with Siddharth Jadhav’s peculiar character. His efforts indeed deserve appreciation, considering the manner in which he entertains out of nowhere. His diligent performance, on the other hand, draws your sympathy without any necessity.Razzakar suffers from poor characterization, dull portrayal and passé dialogues. There is not one single scene in which the debutant director looks promising. And lack of experience doesn’t justify his insipid display.

282,982,982,982,982,[The] Reader,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma reviewNotepad5 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/the-reader-review/,,5/5.0,,3.7,"A love story, between two disparate characters that examines the frailties of the human condition.","That the specter of the Holocaust continues to prey upon the psyche of Europe and to some extent America, as evinced by the number of films and documentaries that are made with unceasing regularity, nearly seventy years post World War II, comes as no surprise, given the agony and torment that the Holocaust generated. Some of the notables in the recent past have included, Roman Polanski’s The Pianist, Roberto Benigni’s Life is Beautiful, and Steven Spielberg’s Schindler’s List.  Most of them have depicted events from the Jewish point of view; of suffering Jews struggling for survival in the face of extreme cruelty perpetrated by the Nazis, or else they have been about people who in some way rescued Jews from the “Final Solution”. The Reader deals with the Holocaust too, but presents itself fundamentally as a love story and a tale of lost innocence; a love story between two highly disparate individuals who in some ways are quite like each other. The film follows a non linear narrative; continuously juxtaposing the present with the remembered past and then plunging back into the not so recent present. This could get confusing for some viewers; but as one has to follow the lives of primarily the two main characters and their encounters with each other, a little patience is well rewarded. Stephen Daldry who earlier gave us the beautifully understated Billy Elliot is in charge here, and he makes a solid job of it. The film opens with an adult Michael Berg played by Ralph Fiennes, ruminating over his past where he has a chance encounter with Hannah (Kate Winslet). We do not see Fiennes for nearly two thirds of the film, except in brief moments, as the story is about his younger self and that is played by David Kross. The first half of the film is shot in soft focus and in warm colours, highlighting the first flush of love for the young Michael and also possibly the discovery of his own sexuality. This phase of the film comes across as idyllic, and we slowly come to understand that both Michael and Hannah have some things in common. The rest of the film then deals with more traumatic events, events that have influenced a nation and whose very presence seeps into the lives of future generations. The film raises questions about collective guilt, shame, individual choice and responsibility, and the notion of justice as different from law and morality. These issues are teased out through the lives of the two protagonists, who exemplify “normal” individuals, but from two different generations. Both protagonists have made choices, and continue to make them, but we are never very sure about their motives. This ambiguity in both the characters is highlighted repeatedly, thus possibly making us aware of the shortcomings of being human; shortcomings for which we have no clear answers. The strength of the film lies in how it takes the overarching theme of the Holocaust and examines it through the perspective of two ordinary German citizens. The script builds layers by commenting on the nature of forgiveness and reconciliation, by examining the role of the legal system, and by depicting the tremendous repercussions such “historic” events have on day to day living. The film has no heart stopping moments, no heart wrenching dialogues; it is deeply emotional but it is all done in a subtle and restrained manner. As with life, the film does not offer us a closure and a neat resolution, and questions remain unanswered. Ralph Fiennes is a pleasure to watch as always, while David Kross portrays the adolescent and later the troubled young Michael Berg, very well. Kate Winslet’s ample curves are on display early on in the film, but it is in her face and her eyes, that her character germinates. The Reader is not an easy film to watch especially for Indian viewers; we have nothing comparable to the Holocaust embedded in our collective consciousness. True, the Partition and its related cruelty and inhumanity have happened, but they seem to have been completely buried as far as popular culture is concerned, barring a stray film here and there. That the Partition has spawned and continues to spawn intolerance and violence has not really been examined and commented upon. That could possibly be because we as a Nation, collectively reject notions of History, and instead are very comfortable embracing Mythology in its stead. The Reader is a very European film, in the sense that it examines History through a critical lens and digs deep into the collective well spring of national consciousness. Definitely worth a dekkho. PS. The film uses the leit motif of reading and of a literary consciousness to underscore the lives of the two protagonists. Again very European, this use of literature and literacy as a perspective on human thought and action.

Or is it just me being wishful? And it might sound like it, but this is a positive review coming from this forum.","I am in a state of shock. Ready actually has a sort-a, kind-a coherent story. Well of course, I'm using the word coherent loosely. And story. And what-the-hell, ""sort-a, kind-a"" too. What I'm trying to get at is, Ready has focus. Or more focus than the director's last outing and the actor's last outing. Put together, of course. I'm not joking or being sarcastic when I say, I found some of the one-liners and movie references in Readyquite witty. I talk defensively because of my general contempt for ""mindless entertainers"". So, you have your standard ""boy hates girl and yet wants to save her from the big, bad world"" routine. Boy is Prem (surprise!) who can get away with anything and is played by your standard Salman Khan doing a ""I can get away with anything, take that, you reviewers!"" I actually saw one one-liner in which I smiled and thought, ""wow! Comic timing and all, huh?"" I don't get phrases like ""paisa vasool"" and ""time-pass"". And surely I know nothing about what works for Salman fans. For example, Sakshi (one of the two Salmaniacs I know)  tweeted  - 
And I thought post interval, the film became more of the same from Anees Bazmee's world (along with its distasteful sproduction values). Till then, stuff was in the believable range. Like, you could see why Prem liked Sanjana and vice versa. Such logic is totally unheard of in this genre. Also, what makes Ready a shade different from other Salman films is that the other characters in the film had something to do. They are a tad more than props that work towards establishing how cool Salman is. For example, Mohan Joshi has a few amusing quips. Though the mockery that Paresh Rawal makes of himself is pretty much the same. Asin looks barely presentable. What went wrong, make-up dada?Another thing that happened here is that there was an attempt at passing on a social message. The irony of the social message was beyond hilarious. A husband realizes he's oppressing his wife, so he gives the woman ""permission"" to eat before him!?! But, you know as well as I do, no amount of ""different"" within the confines of what Anees Bazmee  can make is enough to make a film that I can whole-heartedly recommend. And, you know as well as I do, a Salman Khan fan cares two hoots for what I recommend or not. Go along and watch the next ""creative"" way in which his shirt comes off!

Even if it is a short film, your time will be better spent sleeping.","The best thing about the movie is its length – the torture lasts for a relatively short time. Doesn’t the first lesson in “Murder Mystery Story Writing -101” cover that plot twists have to come at regular intervals? If it does not teach that, it must at the very least have mentioned that you certainly cannot have all your plot twists squeezed in the last fifteen minutes as a narrative, however short your movie is.Okay, maybe we didn’t have time to do the murder mystery story writing course that I am raving about. But didn’t “Movie-Making -101” mention that you need people who have some sort of acting skills to play the lead roles? Celina Jaitley’s facial muscles, body language and dialogue delivery are so stiff that even if the entire budget of the movie was spent on getting an expression out of her, it wouldn’t help. A few scenes in the dark were effectively used to hide her face when she needed to show charged emotions. Kindly appreciate how craftily I avoided using the words ‘Celina Jaitley’ and ‘acting’ in the same sentence. Oops! I just did it, will make a better attempt next time! The intimate scenes are steamy but exist only to sensationalize. Aftab was just alright.One person who surely has taken lessons is the lyricist, Sameer.  Of course, he quit after the basic course which taught him to use rhyming words at the end of each sentence. The music sounded like any other Himesh Reshammiya product, namely bad.Weak narration style, weaker character sketches, and godawful dialogues. Top it off with women who think sighing = acting.

That's pretty much all the backdrop you're going to need on the lead characters. Though the story is adapted from the three-issue comic book series, it is much more comic than the comics itself. For once the comic is more darker than its movie. By introducing more characters and comic elements, they compromised on the story and made it a character driven film. And it worked. It's a must watch for the sake of the cast. But if you're not that big a fan, you can skip watching it in a theater.","RED stands for Retired and Extremely Dangerous. And Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich  & Helen Mirren are so “ED”. Though the movie is based on the three-issue comic series by the same name, it has a pop-ish take on it. Since the comic-series didn't have enough content to be translated into a full movie they introduced many new characters and made the movie more comical than the comic-series. The concept of the movie is that a high-up official tries to pull off a conspiracy by taking off the good guys. But the picked the wrong lot to mess with. (Come on, no one messes with Bruce Willis! Even a fifth grader knows that.) The story however takes the back side, as it's the lead actors that shine throughout the film and make the movie-watching experience worth the money.The movie is very stylish and the action scenes are beautifully shot. I've watched the scene in the promos, where Bruce Willis casually steps out of the moving car, countless number of times, and never got enough of it. The screenplay is average but the performances are very powerful. Bruce Willis owns the role of Frank Moses. One second he is believable as the gentle giant to Mary-Louise Parker, and the next second he is out there knocking bad guys by the dozen as a highly efficient black-ops agent. Very few actors can come close to Bruce Willis when it comes to pulling off an action film with tongue in cheek dialogues. I for one, am his 'die hard' fan (Pun full-on intended). Morgan Freeman is composed as ever in his somewhat short role. John Malkovich was the pick of the lot for me. He was brilliant in the role of an eccentric retired agent who suspects everyone and everything. And Helen Mirren. Oh, she still steals the spotlight every time she's on screen - gracious as ever. Mary-Louise Parker did over act her part as Frank Moses' love interest, who is clueless about all the chaos surrounding her life. But knowing her capabilities as an actress, I guess she just made the best of what she was told to do. She had her moments to shine too. Brian Cox has a very interesting role in the film, one with many shades. He too fits in the character effortlessly. Lastly, if you don't recall the name Karl Urban yet (the new Dr. Bones, in the Star Trek franchise), you'll surely be hearing a lot of him in the future. After all, he is going to play THE Judge Dredd in its remake, scheduled to release in 2012. He plays the antagonist and managed to stand his ground pretty well in front of the biggies. Watch out for him. It's all good in the acting department, so the fault totally lies in the screenplay that fails to keep you excited. The lack of seriousness works for the characters but fails the story. It won't leave you in awe, but you'll enjoy watching it. After The Expendables and RED, looks like, too many cooks may not be that bad a thing. With these guys gone, it'll be end of an era for action movies. They dictate how action is supposed to be done. Watch it for the cast, as we don't know how long they'll hang around. But there's something to look forward to. Since a prequel to the comic-series has been announced, we just might have a prequel to the movie.

286,986,986,986,986,Red 2,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/red-2-review/,,,,3.35,"Bruce Willis and his team of veterans are back, and this time they seem to be as clueless about what to do, as the audience is. The great cast and some goofy lines do intermittently make up for some shoddy writing, making Red 2 a passable watch, but nothing more.","Sometimes, the mere thought of reboots, remakes and sequels coming out of Hollywood these days exhausts you. In fact, even complaining about it has become passé. That was quite how I felt before I watched Red 2, despite the fact that it stars some of the most dependable names you can think of. Now these names I’m talking about are terrific as usual. But, yet again, a predictable and contrived plot that meanders around itself for no apparent reason lets Red 2 down. It is fun in spurts, but never enough to truly elevate the film.Taking off from about where the previous film ended, retired CIA agent Frank Moses and call center employee Sarah are together now, trying to lead a quiet life. However, Frank is unexpectedly put on the run when he learns that he’s a hunted man again, and it may have something to do with a Cold War weapons project. Then ensues the madness.Yes, there is the deadpan humour to keep you company throughout the length of the film. And there’s Bruce Willis as Frank Moses, who always kicks behinds even when he’s sleepwalking through his role. Most importantly, at least for me personally, there’s Helen Mirren, who, in her brief role, shows the boys – Willis included – just how a gun must truly be handled on screen. Together with John Malkovich reprising his adorable character as Frank’s friend Marvin and Anthony Hopkins who turns out the best performance of the film as the ex-scientist gone bonkers, the cast of the film ensure that at least you aren’t shifting in your seats all throughout, waiting for the film to end.But the writing takes such blatant liberties and forces so many conveniences down your throat, that you’re always questioning logic in the film, even though you know that you are just not supposed to. And I’m not just talking about the fundamental premise of near-sextagenerians numbering in single digits bringing down entire squads all by themselves. Every time our heroes so easily enter buildings, known to be heavily fortified with the best in security, then wreak mayhem there and escape unscathed, all for a purpose that seems almost pointless, all you can do is heave a sigh, and wait for the next bit of screenplay frivolity.Also, with action films being almost the norm of the day, it seems to have become very difficult to truly design and execute path-breaking action off late. Save for one fun car chase sequence that has Dame Helen Lydia Mirren once again adding some delightful - ahem - icing on the cake, even the action is of the déjà vu variety. Director Dean Parisot, whose last theatrical feature was the watchable-but-forgettable Jim Carrey-starrer Fun With Dick and Jane, seems to specialize in precisely that kind of film. Besides, I couldn’t help feeling, more than once, that this was a cast that was a little bit out of his league. They seemed to run on autopilot, without the firm hand of a director’s vision guiding them. Or was I expecting too much there?Red 2, quite like its predecessor, would make for a passable DVD watch. In fact, purely because of the effortlessly charming cast, the two films back-to-back wouldn’t make for a bad lazy afternoon double feature. But don’t expect to walk in to the theatre and leave it feeling completely satisfied.

Suneil Shetty as the meek-but-aware low-ranker in a naxal outfit tells his comrades, ""Wake up before it's too late. Wake up before we kill or worse, corrupt each other completely. Wake up before we lose sight of what it is we are fighting for and against."" All this in a non-preachy tone and with some awesome performances.","Different story, different issue, different aesthetics, different acting by lead actors - a film deserves applause just for doing this. Now it's a different story that it doesn't completely connect or make you care for the characters let alone the issue at hand. A lot seems missing despite what looks like best efforts.I'm not asking for a more complete coverage of the events in the regions facing Naxal protests. Considering that Red Alert tries to maintain balance between the two perspectives, asking for anything more is way beyond a 2-hour film's purview.  I'm not complaining about the pace at which the events unfold. In fact, it is a wonderful depiction of what an unwilling member of a rebelling faction goes through. How like in any other group, peer pressure makes him do things he's not convinced of. He might seem like the 'group idiot' but he does have an opinion, a balanced thought-process which has withstood brainwashing. And he's brave too. I understand and appreciate all of this and yet the pathos doesn't come through. One could have blamed Suneil Shetty's performance for the 'something missing' feeling, but that doesn't seem fair. He holds one expression, and maybe that's the only expression his character needs. It's something about the writing and portrayal of this character that doesn't completely make me root for him. This would have been a great reaction to have if he were a gray character, but that's not true either. The rest of the characters are very superficially described. Like every other Hindi film, their tranformations and character arcs are far from convincing. Given these pre-defined changes, the acting though, takes the pinch away. Kudos to Sameera Reddy for the complete shift in image. The rest of the cast has always been appreciated for their accomplishments. I'd say this film works as a documentation of the times and situations we live in. Our apathy towards what our eyes don't see and what doesn't affect us directly. Our ennui with every-day headlines that make it to the newspapers. Also, you cannot miss the comment on futility of war - even if it is within the boundaries of one country. And in this atmosphere is the story of a simple man who is constantly interrogating himself and those around him about the rationalizations of their behavior. Ps. I'll skip the notepad section for this one because it's the intention of making the film that I'm convinced about and I cannot make myself look for the loopholes in the script or presentation.

288,988,988,988,988,[The] Reluctant Fundamentalist,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/reluctant-fundamentalist-review/,,5/5.0,,3.2,"Squandering away the opportunity to make a truly thought-provoking film set around a gripping thriller, Mira Nair’s The Reluctant Fundamentalist instead takes the conventional, stereotype-fueled route and ends up a bit of a disappointment. Perhaps worth a watch for some, because of the look-and-feel it creates and for the lead performance by Riz Ahmed, it is nevertheless seldom more than just watchable.","It seems all Hollywood has to offer us this week are adaptations of books. Mira Nair’s screen adaptation of Pakistani author Mohsin Hamid’s 2007 book ‘The Reluctant Fundamentalist’ appealed to me instantly because of the gritty, haunting atmosphere it creates right from the first frame of the film. However, it seldom manages to move you because of the broad, over-dramatic manner in which the story is treated. Mira Nair seems to have thrown everything she had at this film, but decided to leave subtlety in her back pocket.Set around a fictitious incident of international significance and traveling back-and-forth in time to reveal the journey of the protagonist, the film had all the potential to be a taut, gripping thriller which subtly puts forth the message that it holds – of how every man is responsible for his own choices and that in an ideal world, religion would have nothing to with it. However, it is the simplistic and loud treatment that lets the film down almost completely, despite having so much else going for it.
The film is, at its heart, an intimate story of Changez Khan, a Pakistani lad who aspires for what most of his generation in this part of the world aspire for; success in the ultimate land of dreams and opportunity – the United States of America. Built around this central premise is a story of despair, injustice, fanaticism and ambiguous morality that is a repercussion of the most ingeniously horrifying terror attack in the history of mankind. The film tackles a theme that seems staple – how the life of a young Pakistani man, living the age-old ‘American Dream’, changes completely, post 9/11. It shows you what you’ve already seen or heard before – about how every person of South East Asian decent, specifically, every man with a Muslim surname or with a beard, was targeted and singled out for suspicion and eventual degradation and humiliation. Changez’s journey starts off truly engaging you; a lot of this has to do with the performance of Riz Ahmed. The graph of his character, the slow build up of aspirations and love are wonderfully captured by his physicality as well as his eyes. Then, despite the eventual direction that his character takes being established too weakly, Ahmed holds fort and manages to carry you along with him. However, the film primarily fails in what sets this film apart from a regular emotional tale – the thriller format of the narrative. Then there is the black-and-white as opposed to the gray that a story like this should stand for. I haven’t read the novel, so I don’t know if the sharp lines with which characters and situations are etched are derived from the source itself. However, I couldn’t help get the feeling that the book was essentially a film masquerading as a novel – the story and narrative technique appear to have such strong cinematic potential that a film adaptation was almost inevitable. Add to that the visual treatment that Nair gives to the film; I eventually lost count of how many times I told myself what a lost chance this film is.Riz Ahmed’s performance is ably supported by the rest of the cast. Shabana Azmi and Om Puri, who play his Pakistani parents, are a joy despite their brief roles. Kiefer Sutherland as Changez’s ice-cool, ambitious boss is perfect as well. Liev Schreiber who plays a journalist and one half of the conversation that is the core situation around which the film is set, does a fair job, but I often felt that he lacked the intensity that Riz Ahmed had. And how one wishes that the terrific Adil Hussain had more to do than just smile and mutter in a couple of scenes.The film also has a charming little Sufi-flavoured background score that has more than one good song. In fact, as I said earlier, the film had a lot going for it which makes it a fair technical achievement. It is in the overdone dramatics and thrill factor that the film really loses the plot. The Reluctant Fundamentalist is the kind of film I’d only recommend to those who feel satisfied by a film if even just a few aspects of it – the mood, visuals and Riz’s performance in this case – work. Otherwise, it may be hard to find the film anything more than passable.

Andrei Zvyagintsev’s hypnotic suspense thriller, The Return, is one of the best films to come out of Russia. Eerie, brooding and cheerless, this film kept me guessing like none other. A story about how the lives of two young boys are shattered when their father suddenly re-appears after a period of 12 years, The Return is cold, deep and flows like a calm mist, until it arrives at a climax you’d never have anticipated. Winner of the Golden Lion at Venice International Film Festival, nominee for Best Foreign Language Film at Golden Globes, Academy Awards and for the Golden Leopard at the Locarno Film Festival.","I love cinema that can be discussed like a Maths question paper after coming out of the examination hall. Where participants / viewers can compare mental notes. Questions like “What do you think happened to him?”, “Why did he do that?”, “Where did he come from?” It gives the film the much needed mind-space to exist beyond its stipulated running time.The Return is a film in a similar genre. By not making details about the central character’s background explicitly clear, director Zvyagintsev heightens the mystery in this thriller to enormous proportions, and solves itself only partially by the end of the film. However, unlike most mysteries, this one has got no scam, murder or robbery connected to it.Somewhere in Russia, two young boys - Andrei (Vladimir) and Ivan (Ivan) - are shocked to discover one day that their father, who they believed was no more, has suddenly come home. We’re not told where the father (Konstantin) was, all this while. The mother doesn’t explain, nor do the boys get any answers from the man himself. Even as the two of them jump at the idea of an extended fishing trip that the father proposes, they can only hope that they get to know him better.I haven’t seen a film like this, before. The film is intense, brooding and eerie throughout. You’re left guessing whether the father is a ghost, a dictator or a stranger bent on using the kids to further his own means. Why did he suddenly propose the fishing trip? Where is he taking them? Does he want his boys to turn into men? Why doesn’t he tell them where he was all this while? These are questions that keep crossing your mind throughout. Interestingly, these are the same questions that are troubling the two boys as well and making difficult for them to trust the man completely. If you look deeper, Ivan and Andrei represent two faces of a human mind when faced with a mystery - the former is questioning and rebellious, while the latter more easily accepting of things the way they are.There are times when you place yourself in the father’s shoes and realise you can’t blame him for the way he is. He’s been absconding for 12 years. He’s not even familiar with the world of his two boys - what are their likes, dislikes. Scenes where he asks Andrei to settle the  bill at a restaurant, or shows them how to get the car wheel out of muddy track, or how to punch a guy who robbed the two of their money - all point towards him wanting his sons to stand up on their feet and defend themselves. In a way, you can never fully convince yourself that the father is a villain in the film because everytime you feel so, he tops it up with something that makes him endearing. It heightens the mystery about the back-story of the father.The irony of the screenplay - and this is the film’s biggest strength which fuels the suspense - is the mood of the three characters during the trip. Here they are, going on a fishing trail through the beautiful countryside. But there’s very little they speak with each other. The photography captures their mood perfectly, lending itself beautifully to the film’s cheerless feel. The director shows a particular fascination for landscapes, especially water, and you’ll know why, when you see the film.The climax is breathtaking and easily the biggest highlight of the film. The shock, and the character’s reaction to the shock and what follows after, left me with sweaty palms. The closing sequence (a fond tribute to that of The Motorcyle Diaries), seals the films and beautifully, it left me immensely satisfied.I loved Ivan’s performance in the film. Despite being a child actor, he is the perfect nemesis for his father. Shot mostly through close-ups, he is the most well-written character in the film, after his father. Konstantin fits the role to a T and his tall, lean figure and athletic build point to the character’s history somewhere in military Russia.I can only imagine what a high it must have been to discover this film at a film festival. The film is made of stuff that can make you smile in satisfaction for the discovery of a fine, new directorial voice from Russia. An outstanding debut, by all measures.

The concept is novel and there are funny lines, no doubt. But neither of that in enough quantity to keep your attention.","Whatever you do, you shouldn't make a kids' movie that drones and bores. Okay, granted, I am not an authority on what bores kids, especially considering I am not one anymore. But I have a strong feeling this will not work for kids. First, kids are exposed to much better animation. Cannot fault the makers on this one. Because given the budget constraints, visual creativity has been used to the optimum. But, would kids really care about ""value for money""?Second, for a regular good vs. evil story, this one has too many characters. I am not underestimating the average kids' intellect. It's just that except for 3-4 characters, none of the others are well-established. This doesn't give enough material for kids to love or fear the characters.Third, all the humorous spoof-like references to hindi movies of the 70s or cricketers or politicians, will be completely lost on kids. So, could that mean that the movie is not for kids? What's in it for the adults, then? The idea is novel and thus interesting. But, the execution is haphazard and abrupt. The writing too is not the best. Mythology becomes fantasy becomes drama which suddenly becomes an outright preachy social message. And thus no justice is done to any one theme. The songs are just about average and I couldn't hear the lyrics because the music was way too loud compared to the voices. The music builds-up well but lacks a punch at the end of the songs.That said, some of the lines and situations are very funny and some of the visualizations very creative. There are a few metaphors too. But overall, it suffers from not having a specific target audience. In its attempt to have something for everybody, it ends up becoming nothing in particular for anybody. Of course, adults and kids are not mutually exclusive targets as an audience. But, unfortunately, the bits for adults in Return of Hanuman will be enjoyed only by adults and same goes for the parts that kids would enjoy. Thus, overall, it is one of those which you would want the option of multi-tasking with. At home along with work or play and a movie on in the background.

An honest unflinching portrayal of suburban life, depicting the disquiet and ferment that lie at the heart of a relationship.","Nearly a decade after Sam Mendes dissected suburban life in American Beauty; he is back with another intense examination of the same terrain. This time around the story centers on a young couple, the Wheelers, and their relationship. Revolutionary Road wastes no time on romance, but instead kicks off at a point where the young couple is staring at the end of their youth and the beginning of middle age. The script builds up beautifully; the opening sequence takes care of the romance, the second sequence establishes the nature of the relationship and suggests possible reasons that could jeopardize it, and the third sequence outlines and contrasts their individual lives in the present. It is from the third sequence onwards, that the film takes hold and from then on we just cannot let go. The film draws us in to the world of the Wheelers, their lives, their jobs, their friends, and their aspirations as well as anxieties. Each scene is marvelously set up; tiny details are fleshed out exquisitely, both in the acting, the dialogues, as well as the props used. One has to pay careful attention, as the minutiae are extremely important and provide the context in which the action takes place. The camera work is steady for the most part, except in the final sequences where it changes to hand held; a move which accentuates the air of unreality and disorientation that the characters possibly feel. The final sequence and track in leaves us with an extreme sense of unease. The acting is top notch, one forgets Dicaprio as a star, and identifies totally with him as Frank Wheeler and nothing else. In his earlier films like The Departed and The Gangs of New York, it was very difficult to go beyond his good looks. Here, his mouth and his eyes combine to turn in a most natural performance. Kate Winslet is superb too, we see her harried, frustrated, loving, hating, and dreaming. The supporting cast seems to be part of the landscape; they blend in so admirably, their acting so nuanced, that one is totally caught up in the illusion. Michael Shannon as John Givings, David Harbour as Shep Campbell, Kathy Bates as Helen Givings, and Dylan Baker as Jack Ordway, not only act, but their roles, however brief, are critical to the story. The background score is stupendous, all muted piano, strings, and synthesizer. The score beautifully accentuates the emotions of the characters and in the climax builds a persistent note of dread and despair. The film is relentless: it probes every nerve, however painful, scrutinizes myths of love and marriage, sifts through the debris of human hopes and aspirations, and hurtles to an inexorable climax.  It is dogged and ferocious at turns. The viewer is pinned to his seat, squirms and is jolted, as he / she sees lie after lie exposed. Sam Mendes has given us a fine film, a film that seems more real than life itself. Where American Beauty suggested hopes of redemption of a kind, Revolutionary Road makes no such promises. It is an uncompromising and unyielding look at a relationship and situates it within the larger context of a society and its mores. The film is not particularly kind to men; it demolishes most of the fables that men have created with respect to work, love, and family. One feels exhausted after watching it, one pauses and hopes against hope that his or her life not be as shown, but alas, one knows better.

A woman-centric film and all that. Hard to like despite the quirks.,"Despite a borderline cheesy trailer, Revolver Rani - the name, the supposedly women-centric theme and post-Queen Kangna Ranaut make you believe that this film has potential to be a winner. Interestingly enough the cheesiness in the trailer is actually borderline enjoyable quirkiness; the women-centric theme is 
""supposedly"" at the end of it all and Kangna Ranaut does a fantastic job of bringing the zaniness alive. However, the disappointment with how the ""woman-centric"" bit of the story plays out takes away everything from what is or could be appreciable about the film. Despite the spoofiness and the goofiness of it all, I just couldn't believe that was how it was panning out for her, our Revolver Rani. On the other hand, Kangna Raut makes every bit of the crazy Revolver Rani (aka Alka) as believable as enjoyable. Yes, she's over-the-top but in a good way. Now, that's something I'd say very rarely about an OTT performance. Sure, there are places where she loses it and certainly it is one of those performances where the labor shows. But, I must say after Queen I give the lady extra points for just trying. She does lose her steam in some scenes. But, it is unfair to blame it all on her.The writing itself loses steam and becomes repetitive once too often. The second half tries to bring sense to the plot which is a disservice to the hilarity of it all. It doesn't help that other than Revolver Rani, none of the characters get any attention from the writers. They are all rather plain and painfully predictable. The one thing that is consistent and would have been beautiful if it were paid a little more attention to is the background score. It is so asynchronous to the visuals that it adds a layer to the eccentricity.  Revolver Rani makes you feel it had the potential to be an enjoyable, out-of-the-box film. But, I doubt, with that second half there was any possible redemption.

","As a bittersweet slice of life laid out in front of you, Ribbon is richly textured with performances, beautifully layered with content, and sprinkled with occasional humor. One bite, and you won't feel like leaving it unfinished. It is relishingly engaging. Kalki Koechlin and Sumeet Vyas play an urban couple, Sahana and Karan, with such conviction that you can almost hear them think. Their kisses, tiffs, and struggle, carry the veracity of a couple's passion, despair and the need to sustain respectively. Their love for each other is palpable. And even though their courtship is not shown, their longstanding devoted relationship is apparent as the very spine of the story. Of course, there are numerous arguments, as may be evident from the trailer, but what's interesting is that all of them emanate from the larger issue of our conditioning and acceptance of gender roles, priorities, and discrimination thereof. Ribbon thus blends together the personal, the familial and the social milieus, and offers a rather thorough tasting of our times.Kalki is so good in the role of today's urban woman, who demands equality in personal and professional life, that there are scenes where she easily reminds of yesteryears' Shabana Azmi. The film offers numerous instances where Kalki has proven her acumen without coming across as trained or repetitive. For example, scenes where she is feeling frustrated and defeated, yet struggling to not spoil the moment for those with her at that time, even at the cost of, say, thrusting a handful of French fries in her mouth to depict Sahana's stress coping mechanism. In all the variants of such a moment, you realize how well she has mastered the craft of effortlessly expressing transient emotions.The good thing is that the entire ensemble cast is hugely, if not equally, talented and fulfill their part with utmost sincerity. As representatives of real-life individuals we are surrounded by, each character in the film is culpable yet unavoidable. They bring in relief as well as new conflicts. Each of them is thus gray, and hence real. The challenge for the more upright ones like Sahana is to find a way to coexist with such people and yet to hold her own. And Kalki makes Sahana do a fantastic job of it.Direction-wise, the use of hand-held camera helps add to the overall realism of the script. Just like it did in Kapoor and Sons (2016), it helps break the fourth wall and plants you within a scene, makes you a part of it. And, that's probably also why the film is so engaging. You are not stationed on a comfy chair but move around the house, and everywhere else, with the characters. The briskness of physical movement helps you relate with a character's state so much more.The craft of the director is most admirably evident in handling scenes with child actors. Their natural state is utilized well in the script and in their interactions with other actors. Thanks to this, child actors don't look like borrowed props.Then from the editing point of view, the inclusion of details, even if they may momentarily feel unwanted, is commendable and additionally helps paint a pretty real picture. For example, the scene of safety drill at the construction site. Not cutting it out and letting it frame a phone conversation that Karan (Sumeet Vyas) has, is so important in understanding his context and in empathizing with his efforts.In a nutshell, every cast and crew member seems to be focused on achieving a certain veracity, while keeping you involved. As a result, there is something so sublime about Ribbon's truthfulness that it made me sink in my chair and not blink. I had pre-booked a seat in an open-air theater but ended up falling terribly sick on the day. So, I prepared myself to walk out in the middle if I didn't find it too comfortable to sit under the sky. However, the movie made me forget my illness and engrossed me so much that I didn't even turn in my chair.  PS: I couldn't pay much attention to the music, but a couple of songs that play in the background seem soothing. And they don't alter the pace of events in the movie. Thus non-intrusive.

294,994,994,994,994,[The] Riddle,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review,/movie/riddle-review/,,,,3.5333333330000003,"The Riddle is NOT complicated, interesting and exciting. It DOESN’T play with your mind, making you think of the possible subplots and layers to the story and it most certainly is NOT worth your time. Consider this a disclaimer against indulgent, arrogant films that take their craft a little too seriously. ","You would think a 7.1 IMDB rating and a cast line-up including Vinne Jones (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) is a good enough reason to pick up a film – more so a film about secretive riddles going back to Charles Dickens. When I picked up the DVD of The Riddle I thought to myself, this should be a nail-bitter. My nails are bitten anyway, but that’s because I was bored – and therefore I present to you this disclaimer. Don’t Never judge a book by its cover.  Having said that – let me allow you to get blown away by the synopsis, also the only gripping part of the film. The Riddle is a contemporary mystery thriller that sparks off with a woman’s murder, after she finds an unpublished Charles Dickens manuscript. We see the film through the eyes of Mike (Vinne Jones) who is an aspiring investigative journalist. While he is tracking down the script, we are escalated into the world of yesterday, and only after they unlock the mystery of yesterday, will they be able to solve today’s crime.Unlike what it seems The Riddle does not have a labyrinthine pace, where everything folds one after another in quick succession.  After sitting through the film that sounds positively intelligent, you keep wondering if you’ve missed something, maybe you’re not getting the layers after all. All those thoughts will vanish with the climax. I wouldn’t call it a joke, but after you’ve pulled yourself together for almost 2 hours, you’re hoping all will be redeemed with a revelation in the end – but you get zilch. It’s almost too ridiculous to be true.The film could have been passable had the writers taken themselves a little less seriously – maybe made a genuine thriller that follows a simple pattern of establishing-churning-revealing. On the other hand, what The Riddle does is get absorbed in its own arrogance, sunken too deep into what they think is a fabulous story. Vinne Jones is a tad bit wasted, although his acting seems earnest. The look and feel of the film does match up to its era (with the production design and the costumes) with deep blacks and grungy hues. Sadly you’d be able to notice all of this only if you can move past the ghastly play of events that the film has to offer. And therefore, the writing is the main problem with The Riddle. The crime scenes are fairly played out well, with the sound effects and background score. It could have been a half decent film had the writing been cross-checked at a development stage.The only extra in the DVD is an extended trailer of the film, which honestly is the best part of the entire DVD. The trailer is crisp, sounds and looks good and has the core concept of the film down to perfection. My humble suggestion would be to remake the film, taking it from the trailer and making it more coherent, tight and mildly entertaining at points. Not because one needs those elements to enjoy a film, but for this plot it’s necessary to carry the add-ons. It’s a hard task to offer a critique of a film which is fundamentally all wrong. You don’t know how to deconstruct it further and go deep into the layers to offer suggestions. But one of the main reasons why I decided to go this was to bring a crucial point to everyone’s attention. Some bad films should have never been made but there are some films that have interesting concepts and the problem mostly lies with execution. The Riddle belongs to the latter category.Also, for future reference, please evaluate a film with your own rating.

295,995,995,995,995,Right Yaaa Wrong,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma reviewNotepad25 Critic Reviews 3.4/5.0 23 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/right-yaaa-wrong-review/,3.4/5.0,4/5.0,,3.2,An engaging story is told using a number of clever twists. The intelligent outwitting however is let down by some awful performances and a rather slowed-down pace.,"You are out for dinner with a few friends. One of them is a little upset because of something that happened during the day. He gets irritated by something the waiter does and bursts out in anger at him. The waiter had done something really petty, something wrong but not a big deal. What will you do? Join in with your friend? Defend the waiter because it was not really his mistake, but this means you are going against your friend. This is only a minor version of the dilemmas Right Yaaa Wrong presents. The story moves along interestingly and is thought-provoking. If only, it was a tighter and had better performances, it would be a must watch.I completely enjoyed how as an audience, I really didn't know whose side I was on. Both seemed right and both seemed wrong. Both evoked my sympathy, I wanted both to win. And all of this together kept me involved, engaged. Sure, I wasn't 100% involved 100% of the time. First one to blame there is the choice of slow-pace for a genre that needs to be chop-chop. The other one is the lousy performances. Each one of them is performing perfunctorily. The dialogue delivery is extremely amateurish. Especially the bits in which the police officers are bonding in the beginning. True, they are just setting the stage for bits and pieces to be used later. But the functional way in which relationships are put forward make them look manipulated and contrived together. So much so that the likes of Irrfan Khan and Konkona Sen Sharma can't cover-up for the others. These are huge minuses. So, the story had to take over that much more burden of making the film work. And it does. I enjoyed the back and forth and for me that was enough to make my trip to the theater worth it beyond this review. I enjoy court-room drama as much as I enjoy intelligent characters out-witting each other. They might not be the smartest turn of events but they had basic thought put in, which is conspicuous by their absence in many films of this day. Yeah, I'm surprised too. I actually liked a film titled as lamely as Right Yaaa Wrong (especially the extra aa) starring Sunny Deol. Dancing, fuming, and all. But, this is what even a decent attention to story can do to me.

(The last time was in Michael Mann’s crime thriller Heat)
Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are both in their sixties and are legends, immortal beings who have defined the very contours of acting.  They have a substantial body of work to their credit and are to boot superstars.  So one has a right to expect the film to be above average if not good.  Unfortunately, the film disappoints on all counts.  The screenplay tries to be far too clever, but has an extremely weak rationale for the conflict or loss of faith which is at the heart of the plot.  The writer throws in a decoy here, a red herring there, all of which are weak, and then tries to make it all jell together in the end.  All the decoys make the plot seemingly far more complicated than it is, and distracts the viewer.  One starts to suspect the main plot point about 20 minutes into the movie.  The director then takes this badly written material and goes in for fast editing and hand held close-ups to create an edgy feel to the story and characters.  Things seem to move at a very fast pace; I suspect this was done to avoid the feel of a police procedural thriller.  He also chooses a dark predominantly monochromatic colour palette and throws in some grainy, news video type sequences, all for that gritty feel.
He has two great actors to work with, but unfortunately they have no memorable lines, neither do they have any standout scenes.  Both De Niro and Al Pacino are competent; they could have done these parts while taking out their laundry.
We have at times De Niro relapsing into his trademark “braggart” style of declaiming all and sundry, but for the most part his work is low key.  Pacino does not go into the jumpy, edgy mode and remains low key too.  The final denouement is terribly listless and lacks any energy.  De Niro and Pacino go through the routine and the movie ends.  By that time anyways you desperately want it to end.
A terrible, terrible disappointment is what the movie is; one really wished that the director and the writer had reviewed their brief before they made this film. 
Seriously, this one is a terrible waste.

But, the core of the film is pretty strong and makes for a decent watch when you are in the mood of a thriller.","There are two story-lines. One involving a politician, his henchmen and agenda. The other is about one of the henchmen and his love wife. Thankfully, there is a connection between these two plots more than the common character. But, somehow, there is a disconnect. It has more to do with the screenplay forgetting one plot for a long duration when the other is on, thus making them obviously feel like two different stories. Yet, the curiosity of the weird, almost surreal events keep you engaged.The problem with the direction though is that the ambience tilts toward so much surrealism that you kind-of figure out what's going on. Even if it is not exactly what's going to happen, you know the general direction and are just waiting to watch your hunch come right. Fortunately, this is a bit different from outright predictability, because that usually ensues boredom. This does not. There is also an attempt to stick to the traditional tactics attached to the thriller genre. The music and the stylish use of light and camera angle. Unfortunately, it's only a good attempt. The punch is not to be heard or seen. Though I cannot put a finger on what exactly it is, there is something amiss as far as style is concerned making it look ""wannabe"". Then there are caricatured characters. The henchmen have a well-defined but weird trait. Like the guy who hasn't outgrown his nursery rhyme days and likes reciting them before a kill. This, I think is what we saw in The Usual Suspects. Except it doesn't add to the menace of the character, it makes him funny. Which means a lot is lacking in the acting department. Each actor looks like he/she is trying too hard, including the mystic character played by Sonali Kulkarni. And this attempt at being the caricatured character defined for them becomes extremely distracting. And yet, the twist in the tale is a decent one. Even a real good one, if you don't see it coming. Meanwhile, a theater trip can be saved for another thriller, another Friday. This one will be alright on TV too.

However, it lacks a truly exciting story, something that makes it a film only for those who just have to catch every animated film that comes their way, on the big screen. Others will not miss much by giving it a miss.","The first genuine children’s film that I’ve seen in a long time, Rise of the Guardians has its heart in the right place. Based on a book series called The Guardians of Childhood by William Joyce, the film talks about values like faith and children believing in true magic, because let’s face it; childhood is the only time we do, before rationality and cynicism erode our beliefs as we grow up. Jack Frost (voiced by Chris Pine), or the Spirit of Winter, is frustrated for centuries because children don’t believe in him; he has been invisible to them because of this. Meanwhile, children across the world are facing a new threat called The Bogeyman (Jude Law), who is frightening children. Enter Santa Claus and the group known as The Guardians - a group that also comprises the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny and the Sandman – widely loved characters that the Bogeyman is making children lose belief in. The idea of this film seems exciting enough; popular children’s characters in new, superhero-like avatars; strategizing, grouping and fighting off evil characters like the Bogeyman. So a tattooed Santa, called ‘North’ by his friends because of where he lives (which also gives him a strange accent and a host of Big Foots as companions); a boomerang-toting Easter Bunny who isn’t afraid to use it; Tooth Fairy with her assortment of miniature assistants; the reinvention of these characters does make for some interesting, smile-worthy moments.My personal favourite character in the film, the Bogeyman, also called ‘Pitch’ which is short for ‘Pitch Black’, makes for an interesting villain. He feeds on the fear of children, is intriguingly mischievous and has a look that places him in the grey more than in the total black. The character keeps things interesting, often transgressing into a more intense realm but never losing sight of the main target audience – children.The film is also helped immensely by some great animation. In fact, even more than the characters, what makes Rise of the Guardians watchable is the animation and a breathless camera that captures the action quite well. However, the 3D is quite generic. One wonders why filmmakers still insist on 3D, when all it does in most cases is dim a bright film. But the real problem with Rise of the Guardians is that it just isn’t exciting enough as a story. While part of the trouble lies in the fact that it is aimed at children so they have deliberately tried to keep things simple, I suspect that the film will probably not be that exciting for children either. There is too much focus on Jack Frost’s journey, his troubles and their resolution, than on providing a crackerjack animated action film for children. Also, the film lacks substantially when it comes to funny and thrilling moments. It follows a rather predictable graph, never once throwing in a surprise that truly excites. Also, as far as us Indians are concerned, most of us don’t have an intricate connect with these characters, save for Santa Claus perhaps.Rise of the Guardians is by no means unwatchable, but it falls way short of being a must-watch children’s film. This one is really only for those children who absolutely insist on watching an animated film around the festive season.

Through the two hours, the audience is wondering, “oops…now how will he get out of this one?” and that is what a drama should do. The only issue is that the end does not leave anyone surprised. Watch out for some marvelous performances. Randeep Hooda need not prove himself any more in this genre, he has most certainly mastered the serious character - the dialogue delivery, the timing. Vinod Khanna plays his part with elegance and style. The rest of the supporting cast looks perfect for their roles too. Oh yes, there is Tanushree Dutta too, or is there? I am pretty sure, she too will forget that she had a role in this movie, very soon. What on earth was a song like ‘hichki’ doing in a movie like this? It was point-blank out-of-place! Are we so desperate to please the masses that not only do we bring in an absolutely out-of-place love angle but have a Miss India who has no qualms about gratuitous show of skin? ‘out-of-place’ is the only phrase that seems in the right place! Vishram Sawant uses music to cover conversations that the audience don’t really need to listen to. The same technique was used in ‘D’. Surely, there is no problem with reusing a technique from an earlier movie, but doing it through the movie? Was there a lack of talent in the dialogue department? Sort-of. There were some really good dialogues mixed with regular, very forgettable lines. Agreed, like love triangles, there are only so many ways in which gang-wars can be treated. But, today we need something, something more to make the movie stand out. And that is what Risk misses. Or maybe it is time for the director to move on to another genre…

A religion he has defined for himself that he needs to follow and make others follow in his walk towards peace. And they are both preachy.","It's lengthy, it's slow and it's preachy. And yet it's engaging. It's not that you don't lose your patience every once in a while, but there's enough to savor on the screen. And if not that, soon enough, an interesting remark is made or story moves a bit forward in the right direction. A Muslim protagonist, a common man, an auto-garage owner, a part of the local community association - Hasmat bhai (Paresh Rawal) finds himself struggling what he has always believed his religion was and what he's being told his religion is. He believes in work as his religion, keeping to his commitments as his highest priority - qualities long lost in contemporary India. After much internal debate he follows his conscience. If it were not for the thoughtfulness and the sincerity with which the thought is put up that marks the film above average and a must watch, if not in the theater, at least on DVD. Even if the topic doesn't interest you, you might want to catch Road to Sangam just to experience the freshness in Paresh Rawal's ultra-serious performance. A non-caricature, non over-the-top role by him is a gem that can be non-rare but isn't. Unfortunately that can't be said about, some of the other performances. While Om Puri looks rather stiff, the Maulana twitching his beard and talking in a weird tone and pitch was rather amusing. Also, all the talent that went into writing Hasmat's character was absolutely missing in other characterizations. They were rather feeble and except for a one-odd case transformed without much convincing. In fact, Om Puri's character just disappears at a crucial point in the film and reappears as per writer's convenience. And yet the concept itself is powerful enough to let go of these glaring loopholes. The entire 2.5 hours length of Road to Sangam plays out as an intelligent drawing room argument. The pace that follows the life-style in any non-metro gives you time to mull. Mull over issues like the partition of India and Pakistan  was actually a partition of the Muslims. It toys around with what-ifs with remarks like the savings on defense expenditure had the partition been avoided. That done, what is the need of the hour today? Another Gandhi as you see Hasmat reincarnated as Bapu himself, as the latter's ashes pour into the holy waters. And Hasmat is just the common man like you and me - it is you and I who need to go on a satyagrah for our fellow-citizens to see what we really need - peace.Road to Sangam does that for one community. What about fundamenatalists from other religion(s)?

And you know not if you have walked in at the beginning, end, or the middle of the daydream. You laugh because you don't understand what's going on. You feel sorry because you know the distraught water situation of the country. But is water just a metaphor for the various issues plaguing our society. You interpret and so will I.","Road, Movie is another one of those few films that take a while to sink in. One in which most of the audience comes out laughing because they haven't a clue what just transpired in there. Yep, I didn't understand the film, its purpose, or the characters. But, it aroused enough curiosity. And make me think. Not necessarily about the issues raised by the film, but what the film was trying to say. Yeah, it is that kind of a film. In fact, if it were not for the absolutely spell-binding cinematography, I'd have suggested a wait till it's on TV/DVD. One needs to develop a palate for such films, and I'm still not one who can appreciate such narration completely. So what is all this absurd, bizarre talk about. The best way to tell you is as is. And there's hardly any worry of giving the movie away, because it is so open to interpretation. The stage is set with a truck carrying reels and reels of films and the mechanism to play it in an arid, rugged, barely inhabited desert. Water is more precious than oil. Oil is more abundant than water. And despite this basic need people have their aspirations and dreams. And well their dreams come true, in their dreams. Or something like that. :DAnd these dreams have been picturized beautifully. Of course, in an abstract way. It's difficult to explain and it's difficult to digest too. Not to mention that it's easily graspable in the first place. Ok, I don't mean to scare you. It's just that going in knowing that the film is about hope and accomplishment but has a dark and enigmatic tone, might help. Given all the ambiguity, I needed to care for someone, for at least one of the four characters. Ok, I wanted them to find water to quench their thirst, but so did I want the other women walking miles together in the desert sun to find water. I couldn't care more. The characters were pretty flat, except for Vishnu (Abhay Deol). But then Vishnu isn't a person you would care for. You could hate him, if you wanted to spend that kind of energy. I'd say that the Abhay Deol followers are the ones who will be keen to watch this film. Not for him per se, but more for his choice of films. And this one is less likely to disappoint that part of the audience. He doesn’t have way too much to do. And the part he needs to play, as always, he uses his eyes and expressions more than his body language. Satish Kaushik does a fairly entertaining job, but then that's more because his character is sort-of the sweet adorable types. Mohammad Faisal Usmani, the 10-odd year old, had too much of a smart-Alec kind-of a character for me to get interested in how he's played it. The lines given to him are rather annoying. Tannishtha Chatterjee, has a lovely screen presence. I completely fell in love with the song her character sings in the loneliness of the night. Then there are those odd things that stick out. Nicely greased faces with only lips that are dry due to the heat. The background music is beautifl, just that it didn't feel like it went with the tone of the film, and thus stuck out. That too adds to the obscure atmosphere. Then there are people in the interiors having knowledge and presence of mind to use brands like ""starbucks"" in their daily language. And it's an intelligent film, so the line wasn't put in thoughtlessly. Does that mean the entire film is a dream of all the characters? phewRoad, Movie. An intentionally ambiguous film. A film very purposefully left open to interpretation. A deliberate attempt at making the audience yell, ""what the…?!""

They dance sleazily even in a kids' movie!,"Just because a movie is animated and set in a fantasy land doesn't mean it is for kids. But, when you advertise it on kids' TV channels, implies you are targeting them. Then it absolutely peeves me off, the instant you have a central male lead bragging about scoring with 'chicks' in the opening song. It is a sheer letdown that the YRF banner, which usually has decent-sized, significant roles for women, have the two she-characters as mere sidekicks. And the sole function of one is to be wooed by men for her sexiness physical beauty.Nevertheless, the graphic design is certainly one giant leap for Hindi movies. If only the story were too. Even if we forget that dogs are on two-legs, own salons, and dance to sensuous moves at pubs, the basic story is snore-worthy. Not to mention we have seen humans do it countless times. Anyway, one step at a time, I guess. It is sort-of funny when a movie where Aditya Chopra is involved in the writing has references to his earlier movies. Not so when it features in EVERY Yash Raj film. So is this the contract the writer signs at gunpoint? So, yeah if you are likely to enjoy another movie full of digs at their own films, this is one you might completely enjoy. Once you have accepted that, the imaginative and smart dialogues keep that smile glued to your face throughout. It was especially hilarious to see the audience hoot when they hear Kareena Kapoor on screen. She sure has a faithful fan following, even if she's playing a bitch! Saif Ali Khan and Jaaved Jaaferi aren't doing anything especially new with their voices. They all just sound a little gruffy, as if the same digitized special effect was layered over their usual voices. I wouldn't want my kids to watch something that implies so much disrespect towards women and is more-or-less story-less. But, they will. And they are most likely going to enjoy it too. Yeah-yeah-yeah, lighten up, diwali hai (it's the festive season)...oh well...

Instead, what you get is an all-too-familiar attempt that barely holds its own.","If you're a fan of the original 1987 RoboCop, this 2014 version will disappoint you sorely. It has none of the spunk and clever audacity of the earlier film, and takes itself entirely too seriously. Thus, despite having a far superior cast to the original, particularly the supporting cast, the film rarely rises above any generic action film of the recent past.As we're introduced to a future where unmanned robots are intelligent enough to be deployed for law enforcement abroad, on the American homeland they're still illegal. The scheming private corporation that builds these robots then creates something that can woo the American citizens as well - man plus machine. RoboCop. Largely, the plot of the film is quite like the earlier film. In fact, the tweaks to the plot actually make more sense than the original film. Also, the gritty, hand-held feel adopted this time round is more in sync with the kind of films we're used to today. But what really lets the film down is its screenplay. Predictable to the core, the film pretends to have twists and turns, but they are ones that can be spotted from a mile away. Like the original, it attempts to be a commentary on American capitalism and political hypocrisy as well. For example, it seems quite typical that American-built robots are being used outside the country for law enforcement, but aren't used on American soil. But these attempts come across as too blatant, instead of the pulpy satire that the original managed to pull off.There is also an attempt to highlight how, no matter what, a beating human soul trumps cold machine intelligence. This, however, is so half-baked that it comes across as looking juvenile. Surprisingly enough, Brazilian director José Padilha, of the cult Elite Squad fame, doesn't manage to leave a stamp on this film. It comes across as far too familiar from the word go, and not one sequence stands out or stays with you post the film. You wait with bated breath, for instance, to see RoboCop come to life in full glory, but when it eventually happens, it falls flat. If there is anything in the film that stands out, it is the supporting cast of the film; namely Michael Keaton as Raymond Sellars, the boss of OmniCorp, and Gary Oldman as the conscientious Dr. Dennett Norton, the man responsible for creating RoboCop. The two of them, in their respective cheesy roles are absolutely top-notch. They overplay their characters just right, for a film like this. On the other hand, one wonders what in the world Samuel L. Jackson was doing, embarrassing himself as the loud television host Pat Novak. Swedish star Joel Kinnaman plays the role of Alex Murphy and RoboCop, but he just doesn't get enough scope to perform. It almost seems like he was merely going through the motions.  There's some fun to be had in watching RoboCop spar with Rick Mattox, a robot controller and tactical advisor who despises the idea of a hybrid robot-human. However, this doesn't have too much overall impact on the film, because it isn't devoted too much time. This new RoboCop is mere dejá vu, and not of the good kind. You'd be better off catching the original on DVD, or watching Padilha's two Elite Squad films instead.

Sure, slaughter me here in the virtual world for admitting that I'm not even remotely associated with the Rajni-cult. But,  I CANNOT understand what those who belong there would like about this film. It's the Robot being a robot. Rajnikanth was nowhere in sight. I'm talking to my hand, I know. Never mind. You go enjoy whatever does it for you.","I loved the last 30 minutes. There, I said it. I'll add finer details. The whole ""formation"" thingy was brilliant imagination and the execution mani-manifold better. I'd love to see that in 3-D. Did I mention, that it'd have to be in a much shorter film and the context would've to at least pretend to make sense? And there, I just threw away all the brownie points I was ever going to earn from a Rajni-fan. Damn! I have a very serious question. Where was Rajni in Robot? The cool formations I was talking about, where was Rajnikanth sir? As I remember from the last Rajni-film I saw, the whole essence of the film was that Rajni, the human being Rajni, could do all these cool things. Like say, flip a cigarette in the air, catch it right at the corner of his lips, after it is done with three summersaults, which of course happened because 'The Man' flipped it in air in the first place. Here the superpowers were adorned to the character, the robot. Let me elaborate further, see in Dabangg, Salman Khan played Salman Khan. So, even if I didn't like it, I could understand the high a Salman-fan would be at while watching him strut about. But here, I just don't get it. Why would a Rajni-fan want to see him do that as a Robot? Isn't that an insult to his very essence? Shouldn't it be something like 'Rajnikanth adds the R to obot?' Note that I'm not even complaining about the complete lack of logic or disregard to anything intelligent. Even the best special effect films need a thin boundary within which it needs to keep itself. I mean you create a robot to fight for the country and then have him talk to mosquitoes or cheat in exams or swim for a purse. How in the name of Rajnikanth is that cool? I vow not to complain about the lousy action sequences in the rest of the film, the ridiculous choreography and even worse lyrics and music. Palm refused to budge from the face whenever a song presented itself. Also note that I long dropped the wish to complain that for a while I thought Aishwarya Rai was the robot. How could I when the whole system was mechanized. At first, I got the feeling that the story was churned out by a machine. But I banished that thought as soon as I realized that the producer was abducted by a machine, which then took calls on how much money to pump in. Anyway, looks like the producer, like me, will not complain about the torture endured at the hands of a machine. Just heard from a cousin in Bangalore that tickets for Robot were selling for Rs. 10,000 in the black market today. Even if, the exaggeration is sliced down to 10%, does the buyer even give himself the choice of not liking the film?

Time to make that call and hug the friend you didn’t patch-up with ages ago. That’s the warmth you feel while watching Rock On!!. In the end, you connect and that’s what counts!","It’s youthful yet elegant. It’s contemporary yet identifiable with, by anyone who’s had a tiff with a close one. Yes, the layers of love for rock music and issues related to urban life need to be peeled off. But at the core it’s a very simple story told with compassion and sophistication.That doesn’t mean all your questions are answered. The details of the main conflict are left to your imagination. But, the manner in which you are drawn into the story shows that smart people have been involved in its making. So, I submitted myself, albeit grudgingly, to the fact that their heart was in bringing us the resolution and not the clash. I’d suggest you do the same.Whenever I complain about a cliché or predictability in movies/stories, I question myself, is it such a bad thing? How could they have avoided it in this situation? But, I end up with just one answer - it depends on how it is done. Is it natural, does it flow? Is the nature and flow convincing? The obvious call of events in Rock on!! worked for me because I found myself getting attached to the characters and their relatively ordinary lives. (Even though the characters were being followed by spotlights on half their faces!)Each character in the foursome is representative of the kind of people any group of friends has. The idealist whose self-respect does not resign to compromise (Arjun Rampal), the slightly self-centered one who can’t see when he falters (Farhan Akhtar), the easy-go-lucky-cum-jackass who doesn’t let anything bother him too much (Purab Kohli) and the one who’s more emotionally attached to the ‘group’ sentiment than the rest (Luke Kenny).The slight shiver in Farhan’s hands when confronted by his past, made me gape in awe of not just the actor but also the director, Abhishek Kapoor. Unbelievable that the man’s last effort was the appalling Aryan. Same goes for Arjun who looked like he was holding back the dialogues to keep his moustache from falling. Even so, I found myself cheering for him when he came to take his final bow. Purab and Luke too didn’t necessarily have the greatest body language yet, you felt bad for how things were shaping up for them when the going was tough.With male-bonding as the central theme, it’s refreshing to see women with well thought out characters who influence the direction of the story. Prachi Desai is the strong yet vulnerable Sakshi. You feel like shaking her man to consciousness when he’s ignoring her despite the anxiety her eyes convey. You sympathize with Debbie’s frustration which Shahana Goswami so strongly brings across. We see ourselves getting pulled into the narrative because the writer, Abhishek Kapoor, has given each of these characters detailed attention. Together, they mature smoothly from adolescent “we can conquer the world” enthusiasm to learning to live life the hard way. And yet, even the two less important roles (Purab and Luke) have defining qualities and are not restricted to being the protagonists’ “inner voice”. Moreover, this is all done in good humor.Writer, Abhishek has also shown some imaginative strokes. The onscreen performances of the actors mirror the status of their characters in the band throughout the movie. Almost as if the rock band’s chemistry is shared by the four actors. Also, despite parallel narration of two time-spans, very rarely does any event seem out of place.
A plausible complaint could be made against the run-time and pace of the movie. I would argue that any tampering with that would take away from the poise and charm of the experience. Note on music: My exposure to rock music is negligible. I was recently educated by a rock-enthusiast that lyrics are very plain and factual in rock music. The focus is on the music. This conversation obviously came about when I was complaining about the lyrics of Rock On!! while appreciating how different the music was.I’m still not convinced the lyrics should be highlighted by loud and clear pronunciation, if they are not the focus, especially when they are more or less lame.“aasmaan kyon neela, paani kyon geela geela”  would sound great in a kids’ song like “bum bum bhole“,  but didn’t work for me here. (Why’s the sky blue, and water all wet? It’d have been alright if the lines at the very least sounded poetic like “Why’s the sky blue, and the water full of dew?”) Songs from “Zindaggi Rocks” had awesome lyrics; does that not qualify as rock, then? Anyway, I’m going to buy the CD for the music to grow on me. Oh yeah, do stick around till the last title card shows up.

A drama-free which by definition includes melodrama-free execution. Super-witty dialogues that are timed superbly. And a plot that flows smoothly. What more can we ask for? A faster pace? A shorter film? Maybe - but I'll take a little more of this than lose the impact it creates.
Oh and kudos to Jaideep Sahni! This man has some writing prowess!!","The first scene of Rocket Singh makes you wonder if you are watching Wake Up Sid all over again. A not-so-good-at-academics protagonist will find his groove in this big bad world. While the premise might be the same, the apparatus used is entirely different. No generic heart-strings pulled for ""aaaaws"" from the audience. A straightforward, no riff-raff film that you can identify with. And you will laugh your way through the everyday sense of humor it carries. BE WARNED THOUGH: it is not your regular Yash Raj film with a bright song every 10th minute. It's not one where the editor went zip-zapp-zooom to create a fast pace or a shorter film. It's slowish. It's longish. And if I were an impatient viewer, those would be my first and last complaints. And since I'm not, I have more reasons to rejoice, a few quibbles here and there, as scribbled in the notepad section.I'm willing to sit in the beloved dark hall a little longer and watch things build-up slowly. Just in case I miss the finer details that have been paid attention to by the makers, the ones that might have helped create that warm atmosphere and yet maintain a hostile environment. Don't want to run that risk. Especially when one of the most well-known banners in the industry ""Yash Raj Films"" is taking the huge risk of getting rid of the female lead altogether and having a minimum of songs. An hour into the movie and I, a fan of the non-standard Hindi films, wanted to scream ""Where's the GIRL?"" And what a huge risk that is for budding ""star"" Ranbir Kapoor too. But like they say, even superheroes take risks. Why shouldn't our heroes, then? Many of us don't aspire to much. If we aren't one of them, we know someone very closely, who is happy with what they get and don't think they deserve any better. Our man, Harpreet Singh Bedi (Ranbir Kapoor) is one of them. He doesn't meddle with his life too much. Until, one day, realization dawns. And let me not scare you. It's not the epiphany waiting to happen. It is a slow, gradual call on the self. You'll see yourself, if you went through what Harpreet went through with his baggage of values. Rocket Singh is also a detailed comment on how the corporate world and more specifically, cut-throat sales departments work. The sleaze is shown, but you don't puke, because it is shown so matter-of-factly. After all, you run that rat-race too. And remarkably the character transitions are very believable too. An academically challenged commerce student doesn't turn into a superhuman in a skill set he thinks he's good at. When the tables turn, they do so subtly. The sweet talk, lies and malice turn into shrewd judgment calls. The ""anti-heroes"" are no dumbwits or ""just-do-it"" bosses. They can walk the talk too. And all of this with sharp dialogues. In fact, the first half hour reminded me of two TV series that I admire the most for their crisp dialogues - West Wing and Sports Night. These shows were written by Aaron Sorkin who also wrote one of my favorite dramas A few good men and one of my favorite rom-coms The American President. So, if I'm thinking of Aaron Sorkin and my favorite Hindi writer-director Hrishikesh Mukherjee at the same time, the writer of this film, Jaideep Sahni has done his job! You see guys, I had no choice but to love this film. But this also means the film is full of dialogues. Back and forth and back. If you are refraining from creating a non-loud Sikh character, you have done your job well! It's such a shame that this is good enough. And the task of creating other believable office-going characters seems like only a mild achievement. Obviously none of this would have come through if the actors didn't do their jobs or they weren't given direction. You want the idealistic protagonist to stick to his guns but you want him to succeed too. But, you do know that in this day and age you are asking for the impossible, because you want a realistic film too. And you make such a demand only because your hopes have risen due to the perfect casting. From the technician  Mishraji (Mukesh Bhatt) to Giri despite his uneven Hyderabadi accent (or is it Telangana now? :) ). You want to hug them all. And of course you want to beat up that brat of a boss, Mr. Suri. So fresh is this cast, that despite detailed searches on the net, I can't figure out which character is played by whom. The search is on, meanwhile, dear readers, if you know, drop me a line.But before you do any of that, go catch this sales-guy before he achieves his targets! He's not selling a product or a service. He's out there selling a value system. Remember, selling, not preaching. So you just might buy it. You know you want to.

Ranbir Kapoor portrays the pathos suffered in an epic, romantic tragedy. Unfortunately, that and of course Rahman's  music are the only things that are epic about Rockstar. Other than that, it is an abrupt collage of images of awesomely shot rock shows and an attempt of a man and woman trying to find a place for their morals which the rest of the world finds misplaced. Underwhelming - is the word that keeps coming back to me ever since I left the theater. ","""Pursuit of happiness"" and ""right vs. wrong"" are the difficult existential themes Rockstar grapples with. It entails defining happiness, defining right and wrong. Rockstar's ambition is to talk about one of the loveliest paradoxes - in order to pursue happiness, you have to be unhappy. Rockstar also wants to be an epic, romantic tragedy - Greek / Shakespearean / Devdas to Laila-Majnu to the protagonist's namesake  - take your pick. Rockstar is that, but it leaves too many gaping holes for comfort. I'm not asking for a water-tight thriller type answers, but I cannot suppress simple questions like - there are an awfully large number of talented people out there, why is Janardhan aka JJ aka Jordan or as we like to call him Ranbir Kapoor given so much leeway despite his obnoxious self. I understand him getting away with it once he is popular, but when he is a nobody? Just because he is willing to sign some agreements? This in a world full of talented soul-sellers - I mean both in their skill/art and selling their soul. I need to understand why his lady love hasn't heard of this concept called divorce - the involved families seemed open-minded enough.In a film that is trying to transcend into another world, these questions might seem only mechanical. Having to answer them might be mere hindrances in the larger purpose of going beyond...to that field where right and wrong have no meaning. But then, the writer, Imtiaz Ali should've gone all the way and made it a film in which these questions didn't come to me - a film in which I'd absorb abstractism without any qualm. 
Don't put in a silly and out-of-place bhabhi (sister-in-law). Don't put in a forced reason for the protagonist to be thrown out of his house. And please don't suddenly put in a rebellious song with a social commentary just because you had an awesome lyricist and the world's greatest music composer at your disposal. Your character, Jordan is least bothered with the environment and such. Maybe all films about rockstars have to show the star's angst against ""society"", symbolically and literally, which they dole out with brilliantly choreographed cinematography. But then all rockstars dope it up and you did avoid that, didn't you? Because there was no room for that in the story, just like there was no room for the said song in the film. Thankfully, the rest of the songs weave in and out of the film making it a beautiful musical. And a beautiful musical it is. Given the Himalayas and Prague are its locations, I doubt there is anything a cinematographer or a director could have done wrong. And I doubt it'd bother too many of us for too long if the songs weren't picturized too well. We'd rant about it, and pop in a CD and listen to the music anyways, over and over again. The good thing is the film doesn't become all about the beauty of these places or only about the music. The not-so-good thing is that it doesn't become much about anything else either. 
While you do feel for Jordan, it is solely because Ranbir Kapoor is desperately injecting life into the scattered screenplay with Jordan's plain and simple pain and unabashed self-destruction. I usually refrain from giving my suggestions on the changes that I'd have liked in the film, because that means I'm talking about a different film altogether. But, here, I can't resist wondering what Rockstar would've been like if it was neat and clean, linear. It'd have to be shorter for sure. The non-linearity didn't bother me per se, I just found it unnecessary and taking away from the plot. It didn't let the protagonists' suffering build up. 
Especially that of the lead lady, Heer. I'm going to go out on a limb and say the gorgeous looking, hot (even in loose, traditional Kashmiri wear) Nargis Fakhri is a mistake. The 'new in films' discomfort is visible. Her comic timing is way off and she manages to mess the few good lines and situations in the first half. (then the writer give up on coming up with any original lines). Anyway, maybe we just have to wait for her to open up like Kareena Kapoor or Katrina Kaif. But the damage is done to the film at hand. Her inability to emote either her suppressed wild-side, her dilemma, or her physical frailty are the main weak link of Rockstar. The back-and-forth screenplay I would have been able to handle, if I felt my heroine's agony. I didn't connect to her and therefore his love and lust for her. The scarier thing is I got a feeling that the director was treating his film with a one-arm distance too, almost wary that he might get too attached to his baby. I know many of you are keen, but I really don't see as many of us enjoying this one for what it is. Yes, yes, this recommendation is after discounting for high expectations.

The rest couldn't be bothered. ,"Even if it mostly involved thorough research and referencing to put together a bunch of choreographed action sequences, it is a job well done. It is brutal, it is gruesome and it is well-edited. That is about the only good thing you can say about Rocky Handsome. Other than it attempts a sensitive track without engaging emotionally even for a bit; and tries its hand at thrilling with little to surprise you. The big reveal is no reveal because you are expecting it and because it is unfolded rather mechanically. The issues addressed are way too many from drug-trafficking to human-trafficking to organ-trafficking. If the idea was to just display the brutality of the said “businesses”, it came through alright. However, none of it is not new. Except for the numbers maybe. It was cute the way the writers introduced the statistics involved in the movie instead of having them run as end credits. Yes, this is trying to grasp any visible straw. The performances are wooden, this despite cute Baby Diya Chalwad. John Abraham broods and manages a smile here or there. The villains instill fear but it is more because of the way in which they operate rather than their performances. Those seem more comic than villainous. Shruti Haasan's special appearance seems to exist only to add some oomph to a story that didn't have it. It is another matter that the story didn't need it either. This is where the film suffers further. Use of slow-motion under the garb of “stylization” is bad enough, it is used rather randomly too. Same goes for the background music. It takes special effort to ignore the music so that you can somehow stay connected to the story and what's on the screen. The story itself is all over the place in terms of the issues it wishes to take on. The cartels have a familiar hierarchy and the changes within are predictable too. The caricatures trotting around as menacing villains because of their quirks get annoying really soon. Rocky Handsome came out as rather poorly written than anything else. Maybe, we could have excused the lapses in execution and narrative had it been for a gripping story or even if it had somewhat interesting characters. Pure action it wanted to show you and that it does well.

But, Star Wars fans can never have enough, right? eyeroll","The only thing that stood out in Rogue One is how similar the “Darth Vader vs. The Empire vs. Rebels vs. Rebel alliance vs. Rogues” situation sounds to real world wars. That parallel aside, there is nothing new in terms of story or visual extravagance. In fact, there is hardly any magnificence in the visuals. No saber duals, so the unique awe is missing. Not too many Jedis around, so no spiritual-metaphysical stuff going around either. The story sounds complicated to begin with but once you get the bearings, it is the run-of-the-mill good vs. bad. Within the good then, there are factions as there are amongst the bad. But, that is the usual Star Wars fare. The only emotional arc doesn't tug because there is too little of it. The performances of the main characters are what one expects from a film from this genre. Some of the actors in character roles though, especially those that play the villains, are surprisingly stiff. In fact, the voice of the droids are the most noticeable – they make you smile at appropriate intervals. Those humorous lines too are pretty much predictable. The rest of the dialogue is rather lame. In fact, the lines given to some of the people who believe in the force are outright ridiculous. In addition, they are intentionally and unapologetically repetitive, as if to say, “we will not spend any energy to write dialogue for this character, do what you like.”The only value then that Rogue One adds to the Star Wars series is that there is one more Star Wars film to watch. And that is good enough for some of us.

But, the good news for the makers is their target audience isn't looking for logic or cohesion. It is looking for a good time in the theaters by laughing at the silliness and that's what the Rowdy Rathore delivers for them. ","Exactly as you'd expect, Rowdy Rathore is a mix of a clever lines delivered in a rowdy style and much melodrama. The action is every bit macho and played out with much gusto. And exactly as you'd expect, Rowdy Rathore hasn't an iota of logic to its paper-thin story. So, yes for the fan of masala and Akshay Kumar, it's a package worth every bit of the ticket money. For others like us, it's exactly as you'd expect - a few laughs at the silliness of it all.Amidst the silliness though, you are introduced to Shiva (Akshay Kumar), a petty crook, who doesn't mind letting the world know he is a thief, and hates children; and has no qualms when he thugs his friend. In fact, you are given an example of each to establish his character. And just when you begin to admire the consistency of his character even though he's the 'supposed' hero of the film, you are asked to lose hope of any major character development. For seemingly no rhyme or reason, he chooses to tolerate a child who he's annoyed with rather than have his way. When the lead character is given such shabby treatment, we didn't really think the female lead would be accorded any respect, did we? Not with a title like Rowdy Rathore. While Shiva's lady love, Priya (Sonakshi Sinha) is thrown in and out of the screenplay, as per convenience, Sonakshi herself does little with what her role offers. She lacks grace in the dance and is equally rowdy. However, in this age of Kareena's and Katrinas, her rubenesque proportions are a welcome change. It's a shame then that it looked like they chose to go for a 'waist double' for close-ups of her supposedly slippery waist. That or she breathed out really hard for those close-ups. There is little damage control she could've done in the couple of scenes she is handed down towards the end.Then you have a few villains who thrive on humiliating people - men, women and children alike; weaker the better. Living in the heart of the country, no law applies to them.Amongst many such clichés is rowdiness  that seeps through the comedy, action, romance and sundry predictable emotional moments. And the film starts with melodrama, which doesn't dip right to the end. This consistency makes Rowdy Rathore an 'entertainer' that requires no laws of story-telling, or good film-making. The attempt at symbolism is hilarious because it is expressed too literally - from raping the police to the references to the mythology of Ram and Krishna, everything is spoon-fed.What I did like though is that amid a lot of the violence, child artists were largely protected from being a part of it or even witness to it. But that there are a couple of scenes where children to witness utmost brutality makes me wonder if it was by design or coincidence. But that's a small reward (if it can even be called that!) for seeing Akshay Kumar as Shiva dressed in pinks, reds, oranges, yellows, lime greens and purples. You can only imagine how loud the background score is to go with these bright colors. But I do get it that that's the central theme - loudness. While Rowdy Rathore is certainly not a film I'd recommend, but it has a carved audience of people who aren't going to wait for any such recommendation.

Interesting but not enough. Lots of philosophy but towards no tangible direction.,"“A story tells you a lot about the writer.” is a running thought through Roy. Almost forcing you to think that a film tells you a lot about the director. You can tell director, Vikramjit Singh is struggling to tell his story, just like his character Kabir Grewal (Arjun Rampal), a director is struggling with his film's narrative. Roy is not a thriller. It is a romantic film. In fact, it is two romantic love stories that try hard to intertwine and mingle. Unfortunately, this connect doesn't work at all. I can imagine it having worked at the hands of a better narrator but, here you can barely see the parallels even when you are trying hard.The mystique around the two stories as is created in the trailer, is demystified very early on in the film. Only that it is not intentional. In fact, the big reveal feels neither big nor that much of a reveal when it comes about. The film lingers. Not in a good way though. It could be to accentuate the characters. All four lead characters are brooders, the male more so than the female ones. Interestingly enough, the film feels very verbose. Despite the long silences, when the characters speak, there is a good chance it is an attempt at something deep and philosophical. This is great, especially because there are very few films that can say they have non-inane dialogue. But sadness is, the lines meant to be meaningful and introspective turns out inconsequential. I have always complained that Hindi films don't have enough conversations, it has only dialogue. It is refreshing to see characters actually converse in Roy. Individually, the conversations are interesting, but they don't add up to making the film engaging. The lines are not boring but the film stretches on to “nothing happening”. Again not in a good way.It doesn't help that the writing of the “romance” parts is weak. You have no clue what Aisha is on about. You know that Kabir and his character Roy are going through an internal struggle that is a source of their forlorn attitude. But, neither you nor the writers get quite a grapple over why the inner voice is  so troubled.What does keep you going despite disappointment at not being able to fathom what is happening and why are the performances. Arjun Rampal finally comes out of the wooden mould and lets his eyes speak and they speak volumes. A lot of the internal conflict you can sense is through his expression and body language rather than the character's thoughts that come out as dialogue. Jacqueline Fernandez too is less of a doll and has a little more to do with her character. It would've been great if her role was a little more detailed. The most intriguing of the lot, you could call Ranbir Kapoor's performance as holding just one expression. But there is this one scene where the hopelessness of his life turns into hope and you can see the light in his eye change without a movement of a facial muscle. But none of it good enough to make you endure 2.5 hours of “so much talk” leading to pretty much nothing. It is almost as if the filmmakers had a sense of this too. What else can explain the fillers in the form of songs and the fight sequence that seems to have been made just to be able to promote the film as a thriller.Even if you give the film a point or two extra for attempting something different, you can't escape the fact that it is on the borderline of making very little sense. Different ain't good enough.

Rush, directed by Ron Howard, is based on the great F1 rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt, and the film doesn’t ease up on either the drama or the adrenaline. Good fun for fans and non-fans of F1 alike!","I’m not one to subscribe to gender stereotypes of any kind, but there just is something about men and fast machines that draw them to each other. The sound of a high horsepower engine revving, the sight of metal beautifully moulded to aerodynamic perfection, the idea of touching a land-speed of 300 km per hour, the sheer romance of living life on the edge – I don’t know about the rest, but I do know why I enjoy cruising at speeds in excess of what one might consider safe, and I do know why I’ve been a Formula 1 fan for the better part of my life now.If you’re a Formula 1 buff, particularly of F1 history, then you already know who Niki Lauda and James Hunt are, and you probably know about the 1976 F1 Championship in their context. If you don’t know who they are, then, well, you’ll still probably enjoy Ron Howard’s Rush. For the uninitiated, Lauda and Hunt are and were former F1 World Champions, who had a thrilling on-track rivalry for most of their racing careers, right from when they competed in ‘lowly’ F3 together, all the way up to the pinnacle of motorsport – Formula 1. The peak of this great racing rivalry was the 1976 F1 Championship, which forms the core of Rush, which, apart from being something of a biopic, is also a thrilling ode to not just the second most watched sport in the world, but to the spirit of sport itself.Lauda and Hunt were starkly opposite in personality, something that really fuelled their rivalry. Hunt was charismatic, blonde, oozing masculine charm and had a colourful professional as well as personal life. Lauda, on the other hand, was precise, meticulous and dour, and he spoke only when necessary and exactly as much as necessary. Their racing styles reflected their personalities, but both of them were undeniably terrific racing drivers. Quite simply, their rivalry was always a film waiting to happen. And what a film it has made for. Dramatic and thrilling in equal measure, it is films like Rush that keep reminding us that truth will always be more fascinating than fiction. Rush makes you feel for the characters, it makes you want to sit in an F1 car yourself, and it makes you see what competitive sport at the highest level is all about. It is about talent and perseverance, about the will to win, and about the important role that destiny itself has in success at the zenith of your field. Ron Howard has always had a strong sense of embellishing drama, and he’s in top form in Rush as well. The thing about great rivals in any field, be it fictitious or in real life, is that one is because of the other. Think Bernini and Borromini; think Batman and the Joker; think Lauda and Hunt; Howard and writer Peter Morgan capture this facet in a way that’s obvious yet beautiful; in a manner that makes you want to pick a side, but also makes you wonder whose side you should be on.What also works really well for the film is the fact that Howard has handled the racing scenes with extreme dexterity as well. From gorgeous long shots of the track and cars to extreme close-ups of car parts mid-race, you feel the thrill and the adrenaline rush that can only honestly be bettered by actually being in an F1 car.I must confess that, on seeing the first promo of the film months ago, while I thought Daniel Brühl was a fair choice for Lauda, I was a little skeptical about Chris Hemsworth playing James Hunt. I thought he would bring in too much of his own image into the character; I thought that James Hunt would turn out to be too ‘Thor’ for my liking. However, both Brühl and Hemsworth have outdone themselves in Rush. Their personalities play off each other well, and they convince you of the respect as well as loathing the two characters have for each other.Hans Zimmer, for a change, has turned out fairly minimalist score for the film. The music kicks in when required, but it largely plays second fiddle to the characters and their conflict, which works well for the film. With so much going for it, the thing about Rush is, an F1 fan is almost guaranteed to like it, but I won’t be surprised if the film makes a few converts as well. Head off to the theatres, then. Step on it.

315,1015,1015,1015,1015,Rush,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review25 Critic Reviews 0.2/5.0 1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/rush-review/,0.2/5.0,3/5.0,,3.55,Rush is a crime drama that you've to struggle to keep awake through mainly because of a sluggish first half. The second half goes to fifth gear in such a rush that you are taken through the proceedings way too quickly. ,"Some flaky, lame dialogue about truth and its incompatibility with the media. Blink. Samar (Emraan Hashmi) a reporter who just quit his job, gets a deal that is too good to be true. Blink. Emraan Hashmi-Neha Dhupia song. Blink. Emraan Hashmi-Sagarika Ghatge song. Blink. Interval. And all of this in a not so good way. What follows post-interval then happens all too quickly and doesn't manage to create interest that has gone in the negative with the first half. And somehow all of this ends up in a lecture to the audience about how we cannot handle the truth. Isn't that like the lamest excuse for any producer to make a lousy product? That's what the masses, the customer wants. You see, he doesn't like good things - honest reporters, non-sensationalized news, good films, he's such an idiot after all. So, here's the solution - let's make him consume mediocrity. Interestingly, despite having such an attitude towards its audience, the makers have chosen a topic recently attempted by Rann, the behind the scenes of a news channels. Nothing too shocking comes out of this attempt either. I would have brought up Wag The Dog but that would involve saying Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro in the same breath as Emraan Hashmi and Aditya Pancholi. So, I'll keep my peace. Speaking of which, the actors do whatever they have to take the movie forward. You don't feel sorry for anyone, nor do you feel terrorized by the power of the villain. The one good thing that you get out of Rush is Murli Sharma's character and the way he has played it. A delight! The women, Neha Dhupia and Sagarika Ghosh, look great but don't get a whole lot of room to look anything but fake. Yet, it does feel like this theme has a whole lot left unexplored. Another director, another writer, other actors, another film.

","“What happened” might be one of the most consuming question in a thriller. Then maybe, “how and why”. But, all is lost when the narrator messes up the “how the audience finds out.” This is where Rustom loses out in a thriller that otherwise might just have worked out. One of the biggest cop-outs is when the perpetrator tells how he did it to another character, rather than the story-teller showing us how it happened. Even the best of reveals comes across as too easy or too lame or both when that happens. Rustom not only does that, but also has two parallel threads running that don't connect completely in the end. I love a well-done court-room drama, but Rustom doesn't quite make it engaging. There are loopholes and convenient coincidences. In its attempt to keep things light, it makes caricatures out of the prosecutor, the judge and the owner of a newspaper. The main characters all have to wear one expression through the film. Akshay Kumar, the accused, is stern (garbed as restrained?). Ileana D'cruz, the accused's cheating wife is sorry. Arjan Bajwa, the supposed villain smirks and his sister, Esha Gupta, the supposed vamp, smirks more. That is more or less what they do. They are all styled like they are in the 50s-60s. Whether or not it is authentic, it sure is refreshing. At times even distracting from the story. The story by itself works, the back and forth in time-line notwithstanding. But, it all comes crumbling down in the end. It's a safe bet to say that a thriller that goes wrong with its climax is likely to fail as a thriller. If it were not for that, Rustom might just have worked, despite its disengaging performances.

It's fight to have a relevant story is futile because it is nothing more than the usual sequences of chase sequences.,"Movies with a social message either seem like the social message is squeezed into a story that the writers had in mind or the other way around. With Force 2 you can't make out which came first. I wish I could say that it meant the social message flowed seamlessly in and out of the story. Nope, the non-existent story comes about towards the fag end of the film. Till then it is only one chase sequence after another.If only the chase sequences had anything novel about them. It seemed like we have an action film, we have Budapest with all its beautiful roof-tops, so how can we not have a rooftop chase sequence. With an exception or two, there is no creativity in the other action sequences too. The thriller story is more or less a non-story. The villains intentions and motivations aren't something that hook us any more, are they? Sure, at least the villain here is two steps ahead of the hero so we are to wonder what he has up his sleeve. But, it never reaches a crescendo where you can't wait to find out or be bothered if you don't. For all the talk of  “why are you surprised to find a woman at the job?” talk, RAW agent KK (Sonakshi Sinha) is always a few steps behind Yash (John Abraham) – both physically and mentally. Sure, it might have more to do with KK being a sidekick and not have anything to do with gender. I guess we can take this as an encouraging trend – the lady's character in an action film is a sidekick rather than the usual pretty prop.John Abraham, Sonakshi Sinha and Tahir Raj Bhasin aren't really required to have too many expressions – they grimace, stay confused and smirk respectively. For an action film, Force 2 doesn't have any thrill. It is rather plain despite the pounding background score and snappy editing that goes with the genre. Or maybe it is a plain thriller because it has the usual things you expect from the genre.

As predictable as the next underdog film. Good performances though.","There are guesses to make as far as a Hindi underdog film's climax goes. The problem with Saala Khadoos is that every minute in the film is predictable. There are some good performances, sure. Also, it invokes a sadness for the condition of sports in the country. That is predictable too. The system is the worst imaginable film after film with little glimmer of hope. Now, that is one sorry state of the state.I guess, even sorrier is that is the fact that reality must be worse than what many of these films portray. Ah well...Despite the predictability, some fine performances keep you engaged. R Madhavan might seem like a sulking loser. But, there are moments when you can see his resolve to be focused on the future of the sport in the country and nothing else. Viewers can take “he is stern for a good reason” personality as a given – that's how good the performance is. Ritika Singh too plays out various shades of Madhi quite well, maybe over-doing the boisterous bit a tad. Yet, not enough to hold it against her. Zakir Hussain does is annoying bit well enough for you to want to squirm every time he is on screen. And this is all despite the off dubbing. That the actors cannot do more is to be blamed on superficially written characters. The script too is convenient when hardships suddenly smoothen out and smooth tiding suddenly become tough. Which is alright, because that is how life is. But here, it is rather unbelievable. The romantic arc, the change in heart come across as functional rather than organic to the story. The fire in the dialogue and spunk of the first half dies out in the second half and you are left with nothing but a predictable plot and performances you have gotten used to. The writers wanted to focus on the sport and nothing else, and that shows. Other departments pitch in to that effect too. The cinematography is not unique but works well during the boxing matches. The songs, though mostly in the background, jar the flow of the film. Some lyrics stick though, like - Khwaab banke aaya tha tu, Yaad banke reh gaya1.The drama though limited, is very typical to that of any film which wants a grand finale. This unfortunately, makes the film even more predictable than it already is. Unfortunately, that is how the ball roles. Underdog films about the state of sports have to focus as much on being unpredictable as they have to on the topic itself. Else, they are bound to lose. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~1translation – you came as a dream, and turned into a memory. Can be interpreted as – you came as a dream come true and turned into a mere memory)

You can't make head or tail of the plot because logistics go for a toss!,"""Flat but OK"".
- This is how a TV channel describes the graph of the sensex at one point of time in the movie. ""Flat and not OK"" is what would describe the entire movie at any given point. Saas Bahu aur Sensex is about a few women living together in an apartment complex. In an industry where women are mere props in most movies, it is heartening to see someone take the courage to make a movie about everyday housewives. But, the plot is so lifeless that there is hardly any excitement or motivation to get involved with the characters. No doubt it was refreshing to see Kirron Kher as a non-Punjabi, non-loud personality. Also, Tanushree Dutta and Mausameh made a decent show of their introverted and extroverted characters respectively. I was surprised to know that the lady playing the Punjabi from Delhi was actually Sharon Prabhakar! She looked different and annoyed, as, I guess, the character was meant to do. Farouque Shaikh was adorable in his character blushing and getting frustrated alternately. Ankur Khanna managed to make you care for his character but the writing, especially for the climax of his particular character, was unforgivably lame.So was the climax of the movie. The writing, in general, was just too incoherent to make any sense of the characters' motivations. Or, the motivations are so plain that the person seems unbelievable. A representative of each community/geographical region is picked and laced with stereotypes.  Details have no place whatsoever. Things happen and you are expected to accept. The guy who runs the training for accent neutralization in a call center easily bags jobs for his friends. Passage of time is really difficult to follow too. You feel like events are happening on consecutive days, but that doesn't fit in with the way they are laid out. Nope! It doesn't have a great sense of humor either.It might be about woman power but you are turned off by the flimsy writing itself. Let us just hope that in some way it is a harbinger of good times ahead. The Sensex is shown to touch 30,000. Isn't that the hope we need given its behavior in recent times?

The lackluster dialogues, the amateurish acting, the unwarranted slow pace all add up to a tedious watch. The only saving grace is the music.","This love story has nothing unique about it. The two protagonists are equally adorable characters, but want different things. Therefore, the audience is forced to take sides between two good people.  This is indeed a very interesting and novel concept for us as an audience. Also, the good thing about non-unique subjects is that it is easier for a larger audience to identify with the characters. But, unfortunately, whether it is the dialogues, or the theatrical acting, or the slow pace, or the direction, or a combination of all, I didn't get involved enough to care too much for either of the characters. Interestingly, I was more curious about Gulaabji's (Rani Mukherjee's) character. It could be because Rani played it really well and was the only one who got good lines.The other dialogues were outright tedious. Especially the monologues given to Ranbir Kapoor. Both the lines and he as an actor were trying too hard to charm. He seemed to be treading the thin line between being cute and coming across as mentally retarded. And even though he is really good at making use of his puppy eyes, Ranbir shouldn't have been asked to giggle or wriggle. He certainly shouldn't have been asked to dance behind a semi-transparent towel, with light thrown from the ""appropriate"" direction. I know-I know, elsewhere, I have appreciated female audience being taken care of appropriately, but a quarter-monty just for the sake of it? No, thank you! Sonam too had dull lines and her expressions looked like they were on a programmed loop - sad-smile-giggle-happy-glycerinated eyes-repeat. But the chemistry between her and Salman Khan was really good. She did look really dainty and with a touch-me-not quality. But, I would really have liked to see her with fewer layers of make-up. My guess is that she would look prettier. The one thing that I enjoyed a lot was the songs. Sameer's lyrics were only a shade better than his own average. But, the music was nice and soothing (except for the title track). There was something about the way the songs were recorded that made you take note of the singers. Kunal Ganjawala's voice gives the songs the required energy. The group choreography was fresh. But when Ranbir was alone on the screen things became really hilarious. He has this unique Dev Anand-meets-Raj Kapoor-meets-Shammi Kapoor-meets-Prabhu Deva potpourri dancing style which obviously ends up being weird. However, the use of colors and contrast, and the lighting were very different from the rest of the movie. All this put together made the songs an enchanting watch.Speaking of enchantment, we know that the only way Sanjay Leela Bhansali can make movies is when it has grand sets. It's a fetish; it's like choosing the best-looking font before starting work on a document. He knows they look artificial, so this once, he picked a subject that would give him the excuse to use grandeur. He made a fairy tale. Even if you keep this disclaimer in mind, there is nothing spectacular about the sets. The entire movie is shot just within one studio setting. To maintain the tone, the few long shots of this wonderland are animated (with a toy train running through it). But the beauty is captivating for about two seconds. A barely interesting subject combined with an unnecessarily slow pace makes the movie just-about watchable. The main characters are sweet, but do not have the muscle to pull it through.

And at least a few when I am sure most of us won't be able to hold back our tears. ,"There are many heartwarming moments in this film. And at least a few when I am sure most of us won't be able to hold back our tears. It all feels so real. But of course, it is a documentary. However, what the trailer didn't reveal is that it is a documentary in the first-person narrative. Well, most of it is voiced by Sachin, thus making it semi-autobiographical.
Yes, no Karan Johar or Simi Garewal here to extract sensational information. And no Amitabh Bachchan to drown everything with the loftiness of a baritone voiceover. Instead Sachin himself, along with myriad other accomplices, in all his earnestness.Also, in the trailer what felt like a tribute to the ace cricketer, turns out to be his tribute to those who influenced or contributed to his career and life. So, the focus is not so much on celebrating Sachin, but on understanding him, knowing him.It is euphoric, yes, it is bound to be. It is about cricket. But still it manages to stay low-keyed. And in this restrained tonality is embedded a good deal of exposition of his journey, all the crests, and troughs. The narrative strategy is simple--to focus on key people close to him, while following the timeline of his cricket career. Life and career are thus more-or-less equally addressed, and instances from life and subsequent reflections on them, help us understand his cricket better.The voiceover is unconvoluted (no Gulzar here) yet many lines are as deep as Gulzar's. The editing is no mean feat. Pre-recorded footage, most important of which is a plethora of home videos, is stitched seamlessly. The soundtrack by A. R. Rahman is unobtrusive. In fact, the same can be said of every department. Even though Sachin is speaking to us through a medium, it seems unmediated.Alongside his voice, it is heartwarming to hear a fair deal of his wife Anjali's thoughts too. She exposes his vulnerable side. Sachin too admits to it, but Anjali offers a more intimate view of the person as a husband, as a doting father, as a cricket-coach to his son Arjun, and as a semi-introverted partner.I am yet to read a feminist commentary on the documentary, but I am sure it will speak of how a hero's journey is a patriarchal construct, in which women play supporting, sacrificial, roles. But, the fact is that this documentary is all about a hero's journey, one who is entrenched in the patriarchal system. Hope you will forgive him.To this end, it was odd that while Arjuns cricket training was discussed, the career goals of Sara, the elder of his two children, were not included. I wish we could get to know her interests too.That little oddity apart, Sachin is a satisfying watch. And, yet it will leave you asking for more. So, don't miss it. Go watch it in theaters.

For this motive alone, you might consider watching the film. But don’t expect too much of a story or any sort of emotional connect to the film. You’d be better off watching the film on TV when you aren’t expecting anything. ","Jason Statham’s name appears on the screen and you immediately know what you can expect from the film. Former star of films like Lock, Stock and Two smoking Barrels, Snatch and the Transporter series, Statham has stayed true to the action genre – never really deviating from his comfort zone. Safe however, is an action overdose. It’s a case of dumbing down of the basic story, too many unnecessary stylistic elements, a large celebration of Statham and nothing more. In Safe, Statham plays ex-cop Luke Wright who worked for the NYPD and exclusively with the mayor (Chris Sarandon). Fed up with the rising corruption, he decides to quit and get involved in the city’s underground rigged fights culture. You are shown that it gives him a vent for his frustration, over visuals of repeated action, minute after minute.The conflict arises when the Russian Mafia gets involved and kills his entire family over a dispute. He decides to seek revenge when he witnesses the same men torturing an 11-year old Chinese girl, Mei. The film is as much about their growing relationship, as Statham plays her protector.
However, Safe doesn’t hold for long enough to establish any emotional connection. We are told nothing about Statham’s wife, and so through the film we have no motive to empathize with any conversation. The action, as a result, isn’t soaked in cold-blooded revenge either, and therefore it makes for a stale viewing.Mei’s character is written well, and fortunately also has a graph. We learn that apart from her helpless situation, she is also a whiz kid who learns faster than she speaks. The pace of the film becomes a problem; mostly because director Boaz Yakin has decided to depend on fast cuts to establish most of the film. You aren’t given enough time to grasp anything – and before you know it, someone is beating up another person.The first few minutes of Safe seemed interesting. The visual texture of the film was gritty and I was expecting a nail-bitter. Statham takes no time to overpower every other aspect in the film (he also looks uncannily like Bruce Willis, so his bar is pretty high) and you are left, wanting to see other parts of the film. A back-story of Statham’s relationship with his wife or maybe the terror and hold of the Russian Mafia in the New York crime underbelly could have been a lot more insightful for us to base the film upon. The number of could-haves brings down your viewing experience of Safe. Watch it only if you’re a die-hard fan of Jason Statham.

But, it would have worked so much better if the characters had engaged us emotionally. Yet, the dialogues and the general flow of the film makes it worth a DVD watch.","Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster creates a mystic aura around itself. It has the ambience of the heartland where princes still reign their now unofficial kingdoms with pride. With this background, though the story is of the same ol' politics and deceit. Like any good thriller, Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster manages to make you consider the motivations of each character in turn, however small their role in the scheme of things. That is what keeps you engaged. Though it would have gotten us involved a lot more if we were involved with the characters of the film. These characters - be it the king (Saheb), the queen (Biwi), the servant who happens to be a gangster, or the other people around these three main characters - have strong reactions and we are given a glimpse of the justification for their reactions, but not once can we feel why the reaction was so strong. For example, each of the three main characters are shown to be madly in love and that seems to be the motivation behind their strong actions and reactions. But, the only way you know they are in love is because they are having sex with the person they are supposedly in love with. Other than that, there is no clue left of their love. The emotional connect needed to get the gravity of the behavior is missing. And yet, based on just the thriller element of the film, the curiosity of what will happen next exists. That curiosity does wane with the progress of the film because of way-too-many double-crossing and double-double-crossing characters. But still, its not a half bad thriller. A lot of the credit goes to the witty dialogue and its delivery. There is something inherently aristocratic about Jimmy Sheirgill and that works towards making his character the required amount of arrogant and vulnerable that princes in today's times are. Randeep Hooda and Mahie Gill are just about functional. Given the film revolves around their sensuality, I wonder if the film would have worked better if there were actors with more oomph value, especially Mahie Gill.Also, given how much of the film revolves around attraction, seduction and sensuousness, those scenes are shot with the standard Indian awkwardness making you wonder why the characters are attempting to make love when they are so uncomfortable with the very idea. 
With all that's wrong with Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster, it is still a half-interesting watch. Only makes you wonder, what a wonderful film it would have been had it got even a little more right.

Don't miss it, especially if you don't mind a good game of political double-crossing.","What would a king be if it were not for his ego masked under his pride? Even when he shows care and tenderness, there is an air of, ""See, I can be nice."" The queens are helpless, assured about their helplessness and yet maintain their dignity with elegance and grace. Or at least try to. And they are all hurt, conniving, and devious when they want to be. Saheb, Biwi aur Gangster Returns etches its characters in much more detail than this broad stroke and is a huge step ahead of the first installment. Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster Returns is one of those rare thrillers, with double-crossing at its core, to get the balance right. This once, the motivations are more or less clear and the character transformations are digestible given the context of the film. Yet, the film doesn't lose out on its unpredictability. You know that pretty much each one of the main leads is capable of anything, especially if wronged, yet you are curious about their next move. At more than two junctures, a character is put in a wonderful dilemma. A dilemma that tests their loyalties and makes them question the loyalty of the person presenting the dilemma too. This is the most significant improvement over Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster, aided by the fact that sex isn't the only symbol of being in love. Unfortunately, some of these dilemmas don't see a proper conclusion. They are sort-of left hanging in the air.Another distraction was the ambiance. Surely, the film had a majestic air about it. But that is only because of the performances, the language used - aristocracy oozing out of words. The rest of the setting, the background music, the production design were far removed from being royal. Yes, the palaces are supposed to be dilapidated. But some inconsistencies throw you off, like a run-down palace has a modern, expensive shower head, in the bathroom. On the other hand a Polo sequence takes you to an atmosphere far away from where you are, into their world, into poised men and women who'd cross any limits to honor what they believe to be their heritage. But you don't stay their through the film, even for scenes that are set in palaces. For example, a wailing baby in the background seems completely out of place.Also, out of place are some decisions. Did we really need an item number? Even worse, did we need a Raj Babbar to be comic relief in the said song? And how much of a sore thumb is the 'returns' in the title?!If you let that be though, the lead characters are lovely shades of grey. Even if Mahie Gill didn't play it out well, her Madhavi wants it all with minimum effort is the most intriguing. Soha Ali Khan's Ranjana might be the lightest shade of grey, but some events in life do bring out the worst in you, don't they? These women are not the strongest ones around, but they somehow manage to stay on top. Of the cast, Mahie Gill sticks out as over-the-top. Right, she is the sex-deprived unsuccessful seductress, who finds her way out through a drink and another, but she is extremely unconvincing. Especially amidst other wonder lead performances. Both Jimmy Shergill and Soha Ali Khan have a screen presence befitting their characters' ancestry. Jimmy Shergill more than Soha Ali Khan. Irrfan Khan as the only one fighting for his family's honor is as goofy and likable as he always is.  Just for these performances and some sharp dialogue laced around obviously film-y lines, Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster Returns is a decent watch. Add to that well-written lead characters and it becomes a must watch that can make you let the follies be.

And he gets a few scenes right, but other than that his debut as a director Sahi Dhande Galat Bande doesn't engage as a film with a social message ought to.","There's an archaic law, which needs to be changed to be fair in today's times. The politicians and businessmen are taking advantage of the law and the common man is getting the raw end of the deal. The common man protests. The politicians and businessmen try to thwart the protest using the rulebook to their convenience. Sound familiar? And you thought there is only one such law that our country needs to be fixed. In this instance, we are not talking about an anti-corruption bill, in fact Sahi Dhande Galat Bande is talking about the laws related to Land Acquisition for public use. Unfortunately, it keeps it interesting only so much. And falls flat on its face with its simplistic solution.Sahi Dhande Galat Bande is a mix of themes and styles. It's not that these things can't be mixed well in general, it's just that here, they didn't blend and flow well together. This is a film that makes huge spaces of lush green farms look rugged. Later you have a gun-fight in slow motion with whitewashed/bleached shots. Both stylizations work in their space but when put together in a film, they don't look like one product. Sahi Dhande Galat Bande also tries to make a point. But, the point is ages old and there isn't a new way in which the film makes it. Fortunately, though the dilemmas the main character is made to go through are half-promising. And you are looking forward to how he is going to resolve it. It's a different matter that you are let down. But, getting there is fun and interesting. The performances are all good and in character. If only, the writers dwelled a little more on characters other than the lead and brought out a little more color to their personalities. Because they looked like they had interesting facets, only we were not privy to them. Maybe the only reason Sahi Dhande Galat Bande got me interested is the relevance of  the topic is given this week's events in the country. I wonder what would have come of it if the release date wasn't coincidentally so close to Anna's protest against corruption. Surely, I doubt it has potential to ruffle too many feathers even now, because of the marketing budget constraints and the lackluster way in which it's done. But it might do well as the debut film of a director.

It is worth watching once when you are in a mood for a light movie. But you don't need to rush to the theatres. Excellent acting and good direction. I especially enjoyed the parody on everything our ""masala"" movies stand for.  Still wondering what the end product would be if it was 1.5 hours shorter.","If you were to graph your enjoyment thorough the 3.5+ hours of the movie, it would be a bell-shaped curve. At first you are holding your head at all the forced attempts at comedy and drama. Then you begin laughing at the silliness of it all. Slowly the stories start growing on you and before you know it you are fond of the characters. Then comes interval. Things gradually slide down with very intentional melodrama and preachy “holier-than-thou” lines. And you are back to holding your head. This is certainly not the kind of movie where we are allowed to say things like, “Yeah right! Like that happens in real life”. If you want logic, stay home. Treat the movie as one big cinematic liberty and it is enjoyable. The movie weaves you through different stages that a couple goes through to get and stay married. And it does that very smoothly, with grace and elegance. Since there is so much ground to cover the pace keeps you interested till its time for the stories to wrap up.Interestingly, a unique route is taken to avoid confusion that six stories could cause - don’t make it six “complete” stories at all! There are two main stories, three side stories, and then there is the comic-relief no-connection-to-main-story-story. Even more interesting is the fact that all the male characters are more full of life than their partners.The songs as a whole, contribute to the positive experience. Sameer has surprised us with the lyrics of the touching ""Ya rabba"". It was as heart-warming to watch as it is to hear.  “Dil kya kare” and “Salaam-e-ishq” too are sweet - both to ears and eyes. Two things that strike are the use of bagpipes and the sizeable screen time given to Priyanka Chopra. The directorial spoof-touch given to the movie was very impressive. What is it a spoof of? Everything you ever associated with the phrase masala movie (or ""Bollywood"", if you must). Name it and you have it - wet skimpily-clad seductress, falling car, temple bells, random people on street clapping when guy proposes his girl, a comic-relief sub-plot, the mandatory airport scene where our characters suddenly get all control over the staff, the boy arriving at girl’s wedding to stop it… Oops! Didn’t mean to scare you. Not to worry, it is all done with great style. They actually have the characters hold video cameras to shoot the on-goings throughout the first half - symbolically reminding you that you are in a movie. The “masala” gift is wrapped with a tastefully bright paper. And the bow on the top is the take-off on a leading director and a real-life celebrity couple.A love story is supposed to evoke emotions. Many love stories should do so even more. But not one of the six is a tear-jerker. Can't blame the script. The stories were appropriately fleshed out. Special mention needed for the Anil Kapoor-Juhi Chawla story. All the performances were absolutely great! Especially Akshaye Khanna and Govinda's comic timing.  It is the dialogues that lacked impact. There were some very good comedy lines (mostly given to Akshaye Khanna), but there were very few that made your heart go all out for the character.  The basic question is – is it worth spending 45 minutes at each end in despair for the almost 2.5 hours of good entertainment in between? Yes, but you don’t need to rush to the halls.

They have after all mastered their skill. And they get to use it in a calm ambience too. But unfortunately the narration is flat and leaves you dissatisfied. ,"Just seeing Amol Palekar and Sharmila Tagore on a hoarding together is enough to make you want to give this one a try. Samaantar is a quite, serene experience. It puts on screen the struggle between a responsible individual and his/her personal aspirations. However, contrary to your expectations, there are no intense debates to match the intense looks on the lead pair's faces on the promo material. A couple of very interesting points are raised about romance and life-death. But, despite the arc in the story the narration seems flat. One of the huge compromises the story had to make was to justify the lead pair's feelings for each other because of the sacrifices they made in their youth. People, irrespective of age, have a right to love and have their feelings reciprocated. Why did they need a background of huge responsibilities? And despite the forceful filling in of the quiet with backstory, something's missing.It couldn't be in the acting zone. Sharmila Tagore's quite composition as Shama communicates much more than the verbose Amol Palekar's Keshav. Each perfect in their place. These two get you completely involved. Amazing since the man has come back to acting after 30 years. And the lady is one of the most charming and gracefully aging beauties.The missing bit could be because of the slow pace of the film, but there are some very unnatural and unexplained transitions in some of the side characters too. Also there's a very dissatisfied feeling at the end of the film. Maybe there was something a lot deeper that could have been conveyed but didn't. Yet, for the really inclined some of the performances might be worth the watch.

The only saving grace is that a large chunk of the audience will probably think they're really smart, because they'll solve the film's puzzles quicker than the Indian Sherlock they're watching.","For starters, let's set aside the fact that Kaushik Ghatak's Samrat & Co is a recreation of a Sherlock Holmes-esque character, in India - an absolute travesty of a recreation at that. No, first let's talk about the film as an independent cinematic work, a murder mystery thrust into the hands of a super detective.Mumbai-based celebrity detective, the eponymous Samrat, receives a strange case from a pretty young lady, a case that prompts him to travel with her to Shimla. Ultimately, a series of murders unfold, as Samrat races against time to connect the clues strewn across his path and solve the case.Unfortunately, what we're served through this plot (that's anyway older than the hills the film is set in,) is a succession of rather juvenile 'mysterious' circumstances and events which shouldn't challenge a schoolboy, much less a supposed ace detective who can accurately guess a person's life history within minutes of meeting them.  Predictably laden with red herrings galore, the film tries too hard to be clever, but falls flat because the writers either underestimated the audience, or over-estimated themselves. Big work is made of silly substitution cipher codes and clues as simple as A-B-C.The tangled mess of a screenplay was bad enough, but what makes matters worse is that most of the film is shot against a chroma background, with computer-generated scenery added later. It gives the film an fake look throughout; a pity because setting the film in the hills gave the film a chance to be a visual treat, a chance that was squandered by the filmmakers. Now let's get to the film's real crime - the attempted murder of Messrs Holmes and Watson. A mockery is made of these iconic literary characters, as their Indian counterparts Samrat and Chakradhar resort to showboating, buffoonery and general incompetence, while relegating common sense and propriety to some forgotten corner. Rajeev Khandelwal, a fair performer otherwise, really overdoes the Sherlock, while the less said about the guy who plays Watson, the better. The supporting cast of the film is essentially an assortment of people over-acting and under-acting.In an attempt to draw at least something positive from the film, one can say that it least it never drops its pace and might even keep you interested in its silliness at all times - you wonder how much harder will the makers of the film try. Hopefully, Samrat & Co will die a death with the film, and future filmmakers will think long and hard before creating such lightweight caricatures of characters who have enthralled so many generations.

With a stereotypical plot, it says “never give up”. Based on true events, this is a movie that shows the risks that cave divers take.","What could possibly go wrong diving in caves?You have to watch Sanctum to know. I was in a mood for survivor movies, after 127 Hours last week. Though Sanctum is about survival, it comes off more as a drama-heroic-adventure movie. And it says what all movies of this genre say - ""never ever give up"". The film has simply superb 3D effects. I was never so impressed by 3D before, not even in Avatar  or Tron Legacy.After the brilliant scene with the ice cream in Chhota Chetan nostalgia, this is the only 3D movie where I felt like extending my hand to shove that bottle out of the way, and at times it felt like I was standing beside the crew all the time. I wanted to reach out and help. The narrow restrictions almost make you claustrophobic, and yet the vastness of the caves demands exhilaration. And unlike the other movies, this one has 3D all the time – like, even the rain was 3D. With all the breathtaking underwater scenes and that diffused light, it is sheer beauty. Unfortunately, all you can say about screenplay is - same old, same old. Actually, I can make it sound more interesting to you here than it is to watch it. That will at least make the ineptitude of the story look less prominent and you can concentrate on the magnificence of the caves. But since this is ""Without Giving the Movie Away"", I’ll refrain :). Yet I need to say this - why do they always have to add melodrama in the “inspired by true story” films? Bah, that puts me off every time. But on the other hand, I feel thankful it isn’t made to look like a video podcast on the Discovery Channel, even if I love those. In spite of the predictable plot, it still leaves you wondering about man versus wild. Maybe it’s not completely convincing. Yet it’s an evil reminder. It says more about human instincts, how it can lead you to make choices you that wouldn’t have otherwise been made. And that you can do things, because you have to. But of course, it is shown so much more dramatically.
In spite of the terrible dialogues and mediocre acting, I’ll say go and watch Sanctum for the visuals. Thanks to the cinematography, I can totally understand why those divers would want to take terrible risks - to explore a place “where you can shine a light where no human’s been”.
Please note – I watched it in IMAX 3D and think that the awesome scenes that I wrote about probably won’t feel the same in regular 3D.

Very engrossing at first and then gets tiring as there's no new plot point to ponder over. ,"Sankat City - a metropolitan that's a metaphor for human nature. Each of us has a lot of evil in us but at the core there's goodness. And incidentally it’s the metro and its environment that is known to make us the people we are. And yet the film starts of well and some time after midpoint loses the way, becomes repetitive, and boring. It also becomes a tad too loud. Also spoofing old Hindi films is done too often in the recent past that it doesn't impress. Some of the directorial decisions are impressive though. They took a huge risk by choosing the grainy texture that gives the feel of a film from the 70s-80s and it worked big time. It makes the film stand out from the glitzy, crisp images we are used to. It fascinated me through to the end of the film. A montage of interesting, weird characters is weaved together. It is fun to see the way through the labyrinth. Because weird becomes bizarre - yes it's possible. And in a very fun sort-of a way. Unfortunately, stretch it a little too long and you have lost me - which happens here in the last 30-45 minutes. But there are a few good performers to keep it sailing through. The casting of the lead actors was near perfect. Choose Kay Kay Menon for any role and he works, so no doubts there. Rimi Sen is Hindi films' best lady-crook. She has mastered the smirk, the know-it-all look, and the ""Damn! Why do I get confused? I'm a bad girl, why do I have these good-good feelings?"" expression. Another impressive performance was that of Dilip Prabhawalkar. Though exaggerated he did come across as the poor old man who needed to be taken care of. I'm a fence-sitter as far as Anupam Kher is concerned. I always look forward to his films but just can't handle it when he goes in the slapsticky mode. And here a huge chunk of his role was slapstick. The rest of the cast were too exaggerated and spoof-Bollywood types for me to enjoy them. That's the thing with Bollywood-parodies these days. With the intention of reminding us of yesteryears or Bolly's follies, they do exactly the same things that annoy in the actual films. And here's the circle that I'm tiring of. A typical comedy Hindi film is slapstick or a chain of implausible events. A spoof of that will have to be the same - only more exaggerated. So, imagine exaggeration being exaggerated. Doesn’t make me laugh, doesn't make me clap. Yes, the concept is dark, comic and wacky. Full points to that. I wish it was subtle and retained interest till the end too.

And how is a story like Sarbjit to achieve whatever it has set out to do without that connection?While you could blame a film's missing connection on dialogue and performances, here it slips at the first step itself – the narrative. It doesn't help then that the other aspects of the film are trying so hard that the effort is way too obvious. Be it the dialogue, the protagonist's performance, the photography or the background score.The dialogue is rather film-y for a story based on true life. The use of browns and greys seem forced. Together with a background score (though beautiful at times) is screaming, “Look at us, we are so sad. Come on, you be sad too.”As harsh as it sounds, the same is true for Aishwarya Rai's performance too. Yes, I don't feel so good saying that her performance wasn't impressive because you can tell she has given it her all. The problem is that it shows. You always find yourself thinking, “oh wow, Aishwarya Rai is drawing on all the energy she has by bulging her eyes and screaming her lungs out” and never “I can't bear to see Sarbjit's sister in such pain.” Again we come back to not feeling the pain because there was no attempt as showing the times before the pain. The back and forth narrative is now a given for a grim, tragic story. You have to give the viewers a break, I guess. And the easiest way to give them a break is to flashback into happy times with a colorful song. But, the heroes (or victims) of these sad tales didn't get a break. I think this is the main reason we feel disconnected from the proceedings. We don't suffer for 10 continuous minutes what they suffered for over 2 decades. Of course, actors rise beyond these script limitations if they are up to it. Like Richa Chadda does in the one scene that her otherwise mute character is given. Randeep Hooda does well too but as ironic as it sounds it is not really his character, Sarbjit's movie. So, a movie about a wrongly imprisoned Indian in a Pakistani jail doesn't come off as a movie about other such cases. It is about, like a Pakistani character points out in the film, more about the ones suffering outside. It is about Sarbjit's sister's struggle. Interestingly, Sarbjit's wife and daughter correctly point out, after a while, it was the sister's struggle rather than anything else. This very human aspect along with the inhumanity of crushing hope are what made Sarbjit a better film than it really is. Masochistic it is, but for this film to be any better it would have to be a lot, lot sadder.

332,1032,1032,1032,1032,Sare Jahaan Se Mehnga,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review16 Critic Reviews 2.7/5.0,/movie/sare-jahaan-se-mehenga-review/,2.7/5.0,,,3.65,"Saare Jahaan Se Mehenga has a common man figuring his way out of his frustrations, all while trying to be a part of the system. The initially subtle satire gets tiring and then preachy. Yet can be watched when on TV.","Economics. Demand and supply. Beautiful things and their assumptions corrupted by the greedy and power-hungry. The brunt of course is borne by the common man. The man who has to skim on his outgoing calls and manipulate others to spend less himself. The woman who has to cut corners on grooming herself to make ends meet. Though our situation might not be as extreme as that of Puttanpal (Sanjay Mishra), we can extrapolate his concerns to ours without having to stretch our imagination too much. Unfortunately, despite having this to its advantage, you lose interest in Saare Jahaan Se Mehenga quite quickly.Without a doubt the seed of Saare Jahaan Se Mehenga is a brilliant one. Also, there are some details, often exaggerated to accentuate the satire, that are very earthy. Interestingly, the exaggeration too is carried out in a very matter-of-fact manner and makes it humorous. But, none of this lasts and the situation stays flat. Same thing goes for the characters. From the caustic dad to the supporting wife to the full-of-attitude brother to the frustrated common man himself, characters are interesting with a lovely shade of reality. But they don't engage beyond. I guess that's the price you pay for writing consistent characters. But even consistent characters need an arc to make a story.The performances and dialogue put together try their best to keep Saare Jahaan Se Mehenga afloat. But can manage to just about barely do that. The supporting characters take away a lot of credibility.Yet, Saare Jahaan Se Mehenga is not a complete write-off because of what it tries to do. It tries its best to bring out the frustration of the lower-middle class. The use of satire stays in the background yet makes its point - from the obvious one on soaring prices of basic necessities to the joke that 'being of age', being 18 is in an Indian family. If only, it had not given into having a preachy, lackluster turn around towards the climax. Oh well, maybe next time.

Thus killing it.,"The only word that comes to mind again and again is, “whatever”. As someone who has grown up on Amitabh Bachchan films and calls herself a fan of very, very few celebrities, it hurts to see him a film that has no hold whatsoever.Sure, he does his best as Sarkar. Just the movement of his eyes is enough to express doubt, conflict, anger, and so on. But then again if I wanted to watch his performance there are so many better films to pick from. I don't need to see one where everything else about the film wants to make you pull your hair. The other performers have to battle two things. One, their urge to stand against the pressure of performing in a film with Amitabh Bachchan (Sarkar). Two, the director's urge to amplify everything in an attempt to create suspense. Nothing else can explain the tone and voice of Amit Sadh (Sarkar's grandson, Shivaji Nagre) and the guy who plays Gandhi – just to affected. Sure Manoj Bajpayee and Ronit Roy hold their own but there is little for them to do. I think if you showed me any shot with Yami Gautam in it, whether or not I would recognise her I'd know she is from a Raj Gopal Varma film. Something about her styling and make-up makes her like any of the others. And the less we talk about the random scenes that Supriya Pathak and Jackie Shroff are offered, the better. Though more so when one of these two appear on screen, that's what Sarkar 3 feels like even otherwise - one random scene sewn after another. The only common theme through the film is to try to create suspense. But, each detail gives the suspense away. For example, body language is such a lovely tool at the hands of the actors. So much, the audience assimilates without realising.  But, the director chooses to not only zoom in to the eyes, the feet, the flicker of the fingers, he also lingers there a little too long. This tells you too much about the story. For a bit, I thought this was the intention - that the director did not want the suspense. But the climax tells you the opposite. This idea of mystery - to point the audience to the other direction and throw in something supposedly shocking - is the lamest way to narrate a thriller. The rest is the usual Ram Gopal Verma do. Dark rooms, loud drums, weird camera angles. In this midst, it seems out of place, but I am thankful that the purity of “jay dev jay dev” aarti (prayer) is retained. The decision is really easy. Pass this one, unless you have sworn to watch every single Amitabh Bachchan film. Yep, if you are the regular fan, you can easily give it a miss.

If you are mentally prepared for that noise the background music creates and the camera being held in the weirdest possible positions and angles, you can actually enjoy the drama despite all its flaws.","Unfortunately, that also means its not all good either. Anyways, compliments first for making some brave scripting decisions, which is important for a power-of-politics based movie. Though it is common sense that the story should be the focal point of the movie, yet such movies are few and far between. So, they need to be applauded when they come along. But, alas this one too ultimately fails in taking the audience into the thick of the action. Various tactical twists in the story, especially towards the climax are just to be accepted because ""Sarkar"" says so. A riveted Amitabh Bachchan fan might not even mind doing so, especially because the fan is presented with such an intense performance in the long monologues. There's nothing specifically wrong with the lines, they are crisp, and are occasionally garnished with a tangy sense of humor. But, is it fair to make the movie about one actor when the jockeying for power by various characters is so interesting? Without taking away anything from the legendary actor's entire range of expressions, I really would have liked to see the other characters' motivations instead of just a verdict passed by the central character.Also, this central character is not really consistent. His motivations and the way he gets influenced/convinced by his dominant son are rather unconvincing. And if you look at Sarkar's character change over the two movies it is really unbelievable. A man who was so sensitive to a stranger's daughter's rape a movie ago is so practical about death and betrayal. He suffers physical trauma but is willing to treat the death as collateral damage?!Likewise, Shankar, Sarkar's arrogant, disrespectful son (Abhishek Bachchan), doesn't feel fully developed. His quiet demeanor goes with the sudden bursts of anger. But, somehow the father-son relationship seems very forced and contrived. The emotional bond is fuzzy and hence has to be taken only on face value. Due to this one-dimensional portrayal Abhishek is required to hold just this one expression on his face throughout, with minimal variation.Anita (Aishwarya Rai) too has a very skimpily etched out character. Her interactions with Shankar seem extremely superfluous. I think both Aishwarya and the way her part is written are to blame for it. However, it is amazing how deglamorized she looks. And I am not sure where the thin line between identifying characteristics of side characters and making them look like caricatures dissolves. The supporting cast doesn’t do much in terms of evoking fear or hatred. So, my resolution to ignore or rather to make peace with the expected, overactive camerawork and ear-splitting, background score worked. Once I decided not to give these things the satisfaction of a reaction, the going got a little easier on the delicate grayness in the head. An occasional cringe was unavoidable. I'm human after all. The thing is, the director is in love with the music and camera decisions and is in fact very proud of them. Now, once you know that, the only thing you can do is register your protest - ""me no likes this deafening-is-such-a-mild-word music and sway-here-there-and-everywhere camera movements."" I must admit, though, that I didn't mind the relatively limited use of close-ups too much this time around. Part of the credit would go to the performances and a lot of it to the way the faces were lit. The natural source of light is consistently kept in mind and I loved the fact that the colors used were in tune with the general serious and intense tone of the movie.So, very low expectations set by previous experiences might have contributed towards me liking this one. But, yet there are huge chunks of the movie, especially towards the end, where I would have liked more people acting out the story instead of just one person sitting me down and reading it to me. Oh well, worse have been made and yet it's not an entirely dissatisfying experience.

The film is sinfully long, with some mediocre writing not helping its cause. Director Aditya Sarpotdar has tried to offer the Marathi film audience his version of a popular Hindi film of the same genre, but inspite of a fresh cast that manages to hold the film together, it never really rises enough to make a lasting impact. Satrangi Re is the kind of film that one wouldn’t mind watching on TV if it was telecast, but it wouldn’t guarantee that the remote control wouldn’t be generously used during its runtime.","By virtue of being the intense audio-visual medium that cinema is, there are always certain emotions and situations that are bound to make some sort of a dent in your heart, no matter what the final cinematic outcome of it is. So, bitter feuds between best friends, unrequited love and the ilk will always have some effect during the few hours in which the only thing in your field of vision is the cinema screen.Aditya Sarpotdar’s Satrangi Re is a film that has these moments in abundance, by virtue of which the film is never totally unwatchable. However, the film rarely manages to rise above the rather persistent mediocrity in its screenplay. That combined with a rather wishful but generic directorial effort mean that Satrangi Re settles into being just a lazy weekend watch on the telly, nothing more.Set in Goa, Satrangi Re is essentially a rehash of Rock On. Rego, Yezdi, Nick and Jai form ‘Goonj’, a promising local band that aspires to make it big on the national scene. On the side, three of the four are also final year engineering students. Each of them has their own set of problems that stem from their respective social and financial backgrounds, apart from the obvious problems that aspiring musicians as well as engineering students would face.With an unforgivable runtime of about two and three-quarters of an hour, the film is easily about 30 minutes too long for its own good. While Adinath Kothare as Rego is clearly the focal point of the story, each of the four lead characters actually gets ample footage, with a bit more detail into their backstory than the audience usually bargains for. One must confess that there are a number of scenes in the film which audiences would be able to connect with. The frustration faced by parents when their son doesn’t appreciate the sacrifices made by them for his education, the plight of the son in turn, who isn’t able to impress upon his parents what his true calling in life is – these recur in the film in some form or the other for all of the lead characters. However, these scenes deserved to have been treated with far more precision, to be able to stay with the audience hours after the film is over. Senior actors Vidyadhar Joshi and Uday Tikekar, who play Rego’s and Jai’s fathers respectively, are the picks of the cast. The four main leads themselves are fairly easy on the senses, if a little too typical in terms of their look and attitude. Amruta Khanvilkar as the vivacious RJ Alisha looks pretty as usual and for a change plays a character that suits her. One of the biggest letdowns of the film is the music. As is the case with most Marathi films, the music is pleasant. But for a film where music is almost another character, the film deserved memorable music. Satrangi Re has an energetic, youthful feel throughout because of the manner in which it is shot. Goa’s beauty is captured well, though it would have been so much better if some of Goa’s character and personality were captured as well.Ultimately, Satrangi Re appeals only in spurts. When one walks away from the film, the feeling one gets is that director Aditya Sarpotdar obviously wants to be. But it will be at least a few more films before he actually is.

A decent idea squandered by execution that just bores you.,"Yet another common man is wronged by the system and he takes to ""fixing"" it. Ram Gopal Verma sees a solution in anarchy, but hasn't figured it out completely. So, he leaves us some bread crumbs to Satya 3. That, in all, is the purpose of Satya 2. Yet, it could have worked, had the execution not been so drab. This is despite the background score trying its best to keep you awake. Fortunately though, Satya 2 doesn't suffer too much from the typical camera gimmickry we have come to associate with a Ram Gopal Verma product. But, these are only small mercies. The performances are painfully dull. Punit Singh Ratn takes these abrupt pauses between two phrases, that it feels like the film's run-time would have been cut short by a good 5-7 minutes if he delivered the lines the way a normal human would talk. The rest of the cast doesn't have too much room or character depth to make an impression. Another 8-10 minutes would have been rescued if the slo-mo scenes were not at double the normal slo-mo pace. Many scenes in the second half come across as forcefully trying to make an impact, and they do pretty much the opposite - annoy, that is. Equally annoying are the songs that are not only randomly placed, but also exasperating to listen to and watch.Even so, the basic premise of the film is built up such that, just out of curiosity, you want to know how it is all going to end. THAT - how it all ends - is the biggest downer of them all. Till the climax, you are still hoping to figure how the protagonist has ""fixed"" the situation, despite all his inconsistencies and flawed logic. Alas, a voice-over wraps it up as clinically as it started the film and droned intermittently. It is indeed frustrating when you begin to appreciate how the sub-plots are shown in detail, and you are left hanging in the end. The climax reminded me of a Marathi essay I wrote in school, ""The autobiography of a soldier"" Mine was a prisoner of war who went through eight pages of trials and travails. In the end, he is let go, because he doesn't give in to the torture and the enemy gets bored. Yep, the enemy is bored of torturing my soldier. My teacher remarked, ""Well-written, but did the enemy get bored, or you?""

I doubt there is any other way to go about it. System - bad, common man - good. Politician - bad, idealist - good. In that sense, Satyagraha doesn't have any surprises at all. But, the unexpected comes in little packages every once in a while - in a one-off expression by Manoj Bajpayee or a slight deviation from what we have come to expect in such films from the characters. Not that it takes away too much from the predictability of the overall plot, even so. There's another thing about films that take a stand on a social issue that in the writer's zeal to make the point, characters take about turns in their character graphs for no compelling reason. Satyagraha keeps away from any such temptations. This keeps the battle between good and bad very interesting because you are always waiting for the other side's next move. Also, the focus on the issue starts in the first few minutes and stays on till the very end.Except of course, for a detour at Junction Romance. The one romantic sequence and the song that follows sticks out like a sore thumb, quite literally. The picturization of that song is so weird and out of the place for the film that you wonder if it was shot and squeezed into the film as an afterthought. Fortunately, all through the performances are ace rate. Undoubtedly, you forget he's Amitabh Bachchan and worry about Dwarka Anand's blood pressure at the beginning itself, when you see his blood boil and bitterness at the unfairness of the system. Ajay Devgn looks a tad old for the age he plays but nothing like watching a man shed tears on screen to appreciate his performance, needless to say he does well. No one brings out your spite towards a negative character like Manoj Bajpayee. Kareena Kapoor, Amrita Rao, and Arjun Rampal lay their bits as usual. Nothing that sticks out as very bad or good. Yet, Satyagraha stays interesting only because the issue is so close to home. Sure, you have seen it all - in films and in real life too. It manages to provoke you every once in a while because you do feel like slapping the arrogant policeman and your heart breaks when you see the hero do something self-destructive. Also, Satyagraha doesn't let its characters have it easy - they face opposition from outside and within their factions. Things do resolve themselves rather easily but the conflicts are brought up to point out that there are no easy solutions. So engrossed is Satyagraha in making its point that they couldn't be bothered with technicalities like editing, cinematography, etc.  Other than the fact that the screenplay is long-winded and takes a good two and a half hours to go through its business, there are things like sudden close-ups of actors, unnecessary songs that are extremely jarring, product placements and so on. However, there are times when the background score is subtle and invokes the intended emotion. At other times it is repetitive and too in-the-face for background music. So, here we are, another 'message film aimed at the common man' later. You will clap when the villain is slapped, you will cheer at the heros' smallest victories and the stands they take. You will sit through the speeches even though they bore you, because you acknowledge the truth in them. Then what?How about not bribing a law/admin official the next opportunity you are ""required"" to?

338,1038,1038,1038,1038,[The] Sea Inside,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/sea-inside-review/,,5/5.0,,3.566666667,"By far the biggest inspiration for Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s  Guzaarish , The Sea Inside beautifully breathes life into death and the deep desire for it. Most importantly, it does so in a believable manner. Javier Bardem gives the performance of a lifetime, wonderfully helmed by director Alejandro Amenabar (The Others). A tear jerker that treads the fine line between drama and melodrama, with utmost maturity. Winner of the Best Foreign Language Film at the 2004 Oscars, Golden Globes and the Venice Film Festival.","There is a sequence in The Sea Inside, where Ramon Sampedro (Javier Bardem), a quadriplegic for 30 years, is driven to court. Ramon has been fighting to legalize death by euthanasia, beginning with his own, much against his family's wishes.  During that drive, he sees some everyday, routine sights from the window of his vehicle - a mother beating up her child, a man cycling his way up along the countryside, and so on  Beautifully shot, the sequence is a fantastic recollection of his life's journey, his victories, his liberties, his failures and unfulfilled desires. It's one of the most memorable visuals  The Sea Inside.The Sea Inside's settings are believable, and the relationships between the characters are richly layered, thanks to an ably chosen supporting cast who form Ramon's support system. The depth of their relationships, even as they go about doing their regular chores is depicted with much maturity. New characters appear - another quadriplegic, for example, who disturbs the family equilibrium temporarily - but it only re-affirms their love and faith towards Ramon, despite him being a burden on them. There's love and of different kinds. The relationship of Sampedro with Julia (Belen Rueda), a lawyer with a heart disease, fighting for Sampedro's cause, is a stark contrast to that of Rosa (Lola Duenas), a lonely single mother, who on seeing Sampedro's interview on television, is drawn towards him, and tries to convince him to continue living. The drama between the characters is never overstated (Rosa's unwillingness to see Julia with Sampedro, for example). Despite Sampedro's condition, his personality and the sexual undercurrents in Julia's company are handled extremely well. (A scene where Julia is helping Sampedro smoke a cigarrette, is stunningly shot). A dinner scene between the family members and a quiet Ramon lying on bed upstairs, show his isolation from the rest of the world, in strong contrasting visuals. There are few directors who can ably hold a film so well in various departments -  Amenabar is not only the director, but also the writer, editor and music composer for the film. The film is often lyrical, almost poetic in the manner in which Ramon's thoughts blur all lines between reality and fantasy. Despite his immobility, he is able to move the lives of several others. Despite him having loved and lost, he wants to be loved again and his true lover is someone, who would help his cause i.e. relieve him of his condition. One of the common traits of great cinema is that by the time the credits roll, you feel richer - in emotion, in thought, in quotable lines. This film has plenty of them. At its core, the film makes the viewer attempt one simple question, ""If you love someone deeply, would you help him/her die when in pain?"" Interestingly, the film's subject of euthanasia is similar to Million Dollar Baby, which won the Best Picture in the same year as The Sea Inside. I've seen both, but I enjoy some sort of magic in a film’s story-telling, something which transports the viewer much beyond the confines of his seat. In my view, Amenabar succeeds in doing that much better than Clint Eastwood. I'm also sucker for drama and tragedy, and I hunt down DVDs of tear-jerkers with the passion of a Nazi hunting a Jew. Overall,  The Sea Inside is cinematographic achievement from Spain, a country earlier known best for Pedro Almodovar (Broken Embraces, All About My Mother, Volver), but now, thanks to Amenabar, is exporting a new accomplished product. Beautiful.

Those of you who haven’t, this one shows the life of Secretariat and what happens on and behind the scenes at horse races.Based on a true story, the movie is about Penny Chenery/Tweedy (Diane Lane) who, in her unwillingness to just sell off her father’s farm, ends up owning and breeding one of the greatest racehorses. A semi-retired trainer Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich) who took up the responsibility, does probably the best job that one could. And its groom Eddie Sweat (Nelson Ellis) who knew the thoroughbred for the longest time, handles him with the same dedication that he handled several other winning horses. The chestnut colt was one of the youngest horses to win races, and two of its records still stand today. At a slightly clumsy pace, the movie is not exciting at all the times. It is slow and un-happening in large parts which one might as well sleep through. But the other extremely well-done sequences compensate for the glitches. The dialogues are just at par, with only a few good lines here or there. Most of the conversations fail to to engage, where they could have been phenomenal inspirational lessons. But then that is what makes the film look real and unexaggerated in the end. I would have honestly loved to see better acting from Diane Lane, where she's more free and genuine. The forced dialogues and uncomfortable body language for a lead is a huge put off. Malkovich is apt in his little-crazy trainer role, which I am sure, comes from the real Lucien Laurin. The best is Nelson Ellis (Yes, Lafayette of True Blood), in his limited role gives precisely a father’s reflection as he grooms the much famed horse. Margo Martindale does justice to the father’s secretary, Miss Ham who has been around horses and races more than Tweedy and looks after the family. Appreciable was Otto Thorwarth who plays the horse’s jockey, who is a real life jockey and now wants to pursue acting. I really enjoyed the second match seen on TV as the Tweedy family saw it. It was the recording of the actual race. Also the other races, which last for a short while but show real action. I also enjoyed the mute nuances, which said a lot more than any of its dialogues. The movie is good if you can deal with the slow parts. It has a great story but lack of pace and directional competence will make this one a martyr. If you are really keen, then watch on screen.

Inevitably, the story goes all over the place. Many a time, slow films allow you to absorb the characters and situations. Here however, the pace is used to add another song, or establish an already well-established point about the characters' relationship dynamics. These things neither expose the characters nor the situations any further. This also makes Secret Superstar a little too repetitive. There are a couple of scenes which require the drama for the point to register. Especially one long-drawn sequence where the tension in the home is building up with the father clearly getting angrier by the second. You as an audience are holding your muscles tight because you see the mother has no way out and he is going to beat her up. But, barring a couple of such scenes, there is no real reason for situations to be repeated.  Interestingly, things that ought to have taken time, such as rise of popularity on social media, happen in a jiffy (if only publicising on social media were so easy!) Similarly, the establishment of rapport between Insia (Zaira Wasim) and Shakti Kumar (Aamir Khan) is all too quick. So, the pace is uneven too making the film drastically unrealistic, especially in comparison with how it begins. This is not to say that it doesn't get you emotional or your eyes don't dampen or a lump doesn't swell in your throat. All that happens. But, that is more because of how desperate Insia and her mother's situation is. Also, even though the depiction is far away from reality the stories of domestic violence and female foeticide are as close to reality as a flossy, Diwali release can allow.  I wonder if that is the makers' excuse for the airport scene as pre-climax and then the dreaded, predictable climax. Along with these issues, the movie also comments on the reality show craze, industry awards, the change in the Hindi movie music industry and of course the relentless sacrifices that are expected out of you for being a woman and a mother. Then of course, there is the whole, 'chase your dream' spiel. These are all important issues, but that importance is subdued because of the way they were put together. Thankfully, there is no major speech. The “quotoble quote” knowledge comes, in bits and pieces, as one or two liner philosophies – nothing intolerable.Of all these issues, female foeticide stuck with me. Not because of the overt story, but through the age gap between Insia and her little brother. I am glad the makers decided not to spell it out. But this subtlety is reserved for just this one case. Else the movie is annoyingly melodramatic and in-the-face. For instance, Shakti Kumar's arrogance had to reek from every scene that he was in, even the ones in which he is supposedly accepting his flaw. Similarly, Insia's character is also written with the intention of making her look and sound innocent – in every single frame. It is Zaira Wasim whose performances is so rooted, that even the most ridiculous things she is made to do, look possible. Hand-in-hand is Meher Vij as her mother. It is difficult to believe she can be anything other than a submissive woman who is beaten up by her husband (Arun Raj). That you feel like slapping Arun Raj, every time he appears on screen, says he has done his job all to well. Tirth Sharma as Insia's friend and Kabir Sheikh as her brother are age-appropriate adorable. That leaves Aamir Khan and I am so glad that Aamir Khan is left in a supporting role and makes a relatively prominent appearance only in the second half. Even so, his character felt over-written and over-done – after discounting for the fact that it was absolutely intentional. Once you kind-of settle in for the character he is portraying though, he manages to bring a smile out of you. That is the film's only attempt at trying to make things light. Otherwise, the film is a pretty serious take on every issue it brings up. Unfortunately, even as a movie about a singer, the music is not extraordinary. However, the lyrics are great. This again might have been intentional, so that the focus moves from music to lyrics. Secret Superstar tries to do these things but it doesn't entirely work out for the film. It wants to reach out to the secret superstar within us or recognise the secret superstars around us. But, unfortunately it doesn't trust us to unveil that take-away for ourselves. It insists on spelling it out. While doing so, it takes on way too many issues on its shoulders, not doing complete justice to the three core issues it truly wants to address – domestic violence, female foeticide, and  that one ought to follow their dreams. That leaves the film neither here nor there and way too long.

Little Miss Sunshine was one such film and here’s another gem from France, The Secret of the Grain. The screenplay and dialogues are so fluid, it never seems like there was a written screenplay. The actors just understood their roles and acted them out. The riot of voices this creates, makes the characters almost become part of your living room. At 153 minutes, it seems long, but definitely recommended viewing.","Through most of The Secret of the Grain’s 153-minute duration, you get a sense that there isn’t a director to this film. There is a cameraman, invisible somewhere, and an editor with an intuition so perfect that he cuts this film, like none other. You, the viewer are an observer amidst the characters in the world of of the recently laid-off 61-year old Slimane’s world. A world that’s not a perfect family - Slimane is divorced. His ex-wife Souad complains about alimony payments not being on time and keeps him away from the family get-together every Sunday. His current wife Latifa and her daughter Rym love him and despite having to dodge some serious red tape in a quiet port town in France, he wants to start a restaurant on a boat. The main attraction at this new eatery: couscous, something which Souad cooks really well. At least on paper, the storyline unfolds like a family-drama with just the right layers to keep you engrossed. But being engrossed is an understatement. Director Abdellatif Kechiche’s treatment of the script is such, that it makes you want to tear into the screen and make the characters stop howling, offer a shoulder to comfort them and at other times, even join their celebrations. Kechiche does this by shooting the characters through tight close-ups - there’s a family get-together scene, for example, which has been shot and edited with such meticulous care and precision that the cacophony of chatter it generates is loud and real enough to make your neighbours feel you’ve got French guests in your house. Halfway through these scenes, I realised that I was smiling, not for any jokes being bandied about, but simply for the joy of being able to observe a family have a merry time together at a meal. In several scenes, it also appears that the director is also lenient with saying ‘cut’. He lets the drama boil, the characters continue to bawl, argue and shout and as a viewer, you want him to end the scene and move on to the next one, but he doesn’t. He lets it froth a little further, until you’re holding your head in your hands, a bit awestruck at the performances and a bit disturbed with what just unfolded on screen. The delicacy of couscous plays a crucial role in the film. Comprised of grain, fish, vegetables and sauce, it is the staple diet of the minority community that Slimane and his extended family belong to. It is it’s preparation that brings the extended family together, not just on weekends but also to work as one unit to get the new restaurant up and running. It becomes clear, that despite differences amongst people, food is therapeutic in bringing people together. The film, for most parts looks so real and believable thanks to its performances. I must mention Hafzia Herzi, who plays Rym, Slimane’s daughter and puts in an incredible performance especially towards the end. It’s the visual highlight of the film. There’s Alice Houri, who plays Julia, a Russian married to Slimane’s philanderer son Hamid, who gives the most incredible single-take bawling performance I’ve seen. Her outburst is so long and disturbing, I thought my nerves would burst. By thanking his father in the end credits of the film, The Secret of the Grain, seems autobiographical and one can’t help but relate Slimane to Kechiche’s own father. Habib Boufares, who plays Slimane, has a resigned look on his face throughout the film, but his determination to renovate a scrap boat and start a new business, is re-assuring, signifying that no matter how cold the war be between your present (Latifa and Rym) and past (ex-wife and family), with a little cajoling and effort, everybody comes together for fresh beginnings. That’s a great thought to begin the New Year with, isn’t it? Don’t miss this film. PS: Happy New Year, folks!

342,1042,1042,1042,1042,Seven Pounds,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma reviewNotepad1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/seven-pounds-review/,,3/5.0,,3.966666667,Will Smith stars in a film aimed at emptying your lachrymal glands.,"The Pursuit of Happiness (or was it Happyness?) was Director Gabriele Muccino’s previous film that played on screens in India.  Ostensibly, it made a decent amount of money.  Mr. Muccino attempts to return to familiar territory, and this latest is called Seven Pounds.  It has Hollywood’s most bankable African American star Will Smith (a thousand pardons, Lawrence Fishburne and Morgan Freeman) and proceeds to navigate the same terrain, that of the heart.(see the film and you will understand!) The script adopts the following structure: Will Smith’s character, Ben Thomas is introduced; we see the actions that he carries out, actions that seem to make no sense at first.  We understand that there is something that he wants and needs, but the script gives no clues, barring a hint here and a hint there (though even an imbecile could piece it all together).  At least that is how the scriptwriter and the director intended it, I assume.  The glorious resolution in the end, would in their understanding, leave the viewer with such a feeling of epiphany, that all else would pale before it.  Alack and alas, that is not how the film plays out.  Will Smith is all angular and hollow eyed, and attempts a forlorn air, as he goes about his duties.  We see him playing God, with eyes that are brimming with unshed tears and a tattered air of desperation.  How good is his act? Woeful to say the least and woe betide the viewers.  His efforts to look miserable distress the audience.  Ben enters into relationships with other people; the problem of the script is that in order to make sure that your heart is in the right place and that it is suitably moved, the director / script mandates that there be the most wonderful of human emotions (and a sure Box office magnet), Romantic Love,  present.  This development unfortunately feels too orchestrated and forced, and ensures that the film necessarily loses track of the other characters, except to show them for a minute or two.  It is then Romance all the way, a very special romance.  We suddenly get to see a lot of honey golden frames; the two protagonists are framed in soft dewy light, and we have all the clichés that you can throw in – candles, the dinner, sweet gifts, the cute dog, and of course the bed.  All of it is very predictable; the script is just setting us up at that point.  As Ben gets more and more desperate, so do we.  When will it end, possibly thinks Ben, and we could not agree more.    The time does come, thankfully, and the movie then wends its way into a climax so preposterous, that we would need a whole truck load of the good old fashioned liquid to recover.  And then come the tears, literally.  Everyone in the film cries and continues to cry in all sorts of places, to the accompaniment of a softly gurgling piano.  Having done this most noble deed, that is, bring the film to its “logical” conclusion, the director then bids us farewell.  Should you watch it?  Yes, definitely, if you want to see an infinitely sad Will Smith in each and every frame.  You would also want to watch it, in case you are trying to make an impression on the sweet something next door, and show her that you are a person of refinement and deep sensitivity.  For the rest of us boors, best avoided.  PS What was Woody Harrelson doing in this film?  Oh Tempera! (It is definitely not Oprah!)

Past the one-liners in the trailer, Shaadi Ke Side Effects is more-or-less stuck in a rut.","Why do you lie to your partner? To avoid confrontation, to protect them from getting hurt, to protect yourself from hurting, and maybe because you did something to get rid of boredom that they wouldn't approve of. You could blame them, you could blame yourself, but the point is that you end up lying, when you are expected to be honest. This is true of both, men and women. Shaadi Ke Side Effects expresses a very skewed view of this aspect of married life, in a far too stretched-out and repetitive fashion. I understand there are women out there who are like Trisha Roy (Vidya Balan) - obsessed by their child, want nothing to do with their career, friends, husband. And yes, as shocking as it sounds there are men out there like (tackily named) Siddharth Roy (Farhan Akhtar) who think of their child as the third person. But, I guess obsession by a partner begets apathy towards that obsession by the other partner - the obsession could be sports for one couple, socialization for another, food for the third and so on. But, none of this made interesting copy in Shaadi Ke Side Effects.The stereotyping of women is infuriating. But then hey, there are only so many Hindi films in which it is not. In cases like these, I convince myself the makers are not generalizing, they are narrating the story of one man and one woman and their relationship. And then, you see her sister who is similar. And you smile, cool down and say, ""okay, it runs in the genes."" But, Shaadi Ke Side Effects doesn't stop at that. There are sweeping statements about parents of little children. Even under the satire garb, the exaggeration is gag-worthy. And despite all of this, I saw myself taking sides - for the record, more the man's in this case than the woman's. At one point, when things went the exact opposite of what Siddharth wanted, many in the audience, including me, blurted a ""oh no!"". Towards the end, I almost furled an abuse at Trisha out loud. This is commendable, considering that other than the fact I know such characters exist, I didn't identify with them at all. 100% credit to Vidya Balan and Farhan Akhtar for that. Ram Kapoor and Vir Das do add their bit of normal and quirk to the mix, but it is all about the lead couple. But for them, Shaadi Ke Side Effects is one of those films that attempt to find a solution for a serious problem, but don't want to lose out on audience by taking the subject seriously. Given my overall angst towards the film and its take, I appreciate that they do try to say something that is universally acceptable - to each his own. The problem though is that they try to inject it with humor using an exaggerated dose of hyperbole - only to end up flat on its face. Worse yet, you have seen almost all the quippy one-liners in the trailers. Other than a couple of witticisms in the first 15-20 minutes, there is hardly any new material that makes you laugh later in the film. This is one film that shouldn't have been longer than a 100 minutes. Each of the 50 minutes after that 100-minute mark is as boring as the Roys' marriage. That is one-third of the film. Not done at all. The music is decent, but when it adds minutes that elongates the experience, that too becomes annoying. Relationships bud, they blossom, they peak, they plateau, you struggle to make changes to them and then wait to see if they bud again or die. Except that with Shaadi Ke Side Effects is about the struggle. It is cute that the couple is grappling with the relationship and wants to find a way out rather than cop out. You might want them to sort it out. But the problem is that you don't necessarily want to witness it.

Unfortunately, you leave with an after-taste of the silly rom-com instead of the well-written revenge bits. ","Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana gets many nuances of Indian society right to perfection. So much so that it even includes the Hindi film industry’s irreverent melodrama as a part of that society. Only that this bit doesn’t work for the film. It is a complete, disjointed extension to the otherwise well-written, revenge drama the film starts out as. A boy is yelled at by an uncle for teaching his sisters “incorrect values” by asking them to educate themselves further. They are women, education is not really their thing. In a wedding, the otherwise arrogant, aggressive father of the girl, becomes meek and submissive. A married daughter is called a guest in her own parents’ house. These situations made my nerves tense because I have heard them in real-life, some of them were even pointed towards me. While these lines sound dramatic, it is the kind of drama that is seen in real life. While these are some of the overt points the film makes well, the subtleties were rare and refreshing. Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana does not talk about girls not being allowed to dream. It shows it through the sheer happiness a girl expresses when she gets permission to do a certain thing. She is caught by surprise when she her ambition is supported by the men of her life. This is rightly captured by Kriti Kharbanda’s portrayal of an innocent, restricted woman from the heart of her country. A woman who doesn’t know that her dream of being a government officer is not supposed to be a dream but is her right. The drama is moved forward ably with Rajkummar Rao’s (Sattu) depiction of smitten love and insane wrath. He is gaining screen presence with every film. The entire supporting cast – Govind Namdeo, Manoj Pahwa, Vipin Sharma, the lady who plays Sattu’s mother – perform like they were born in the milieu and have lived those lives. Even the shrill, Nayani Dixit makes us believe her character is this know-it-all whether she is being anxious, announcing doomsday or calming another person down. Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana doesn’t preach despite being a film that revolves around two social issues – dowry and a woman’s right to education. While risking on a borderline lecture once, these issues are brought about through the story. That it is not brought about overtly dangerously treads coming across as supportive of dowry or against woman’s education. What could be seen as apathy towards the dowry system actually hints at how sad the situation of woman’s education is – the issue related to dowry has becomes secondary and an integral part of the system.  When faced with a situation where a mother-in-law is likely to not be supportive of the daughter-in-law’s rights, the latter is not able to trust her husband and takes a drastic step – that is completely legit given her situation. What could be seen as a comment made in support of dishonour due to a broken engagement, could be a hint at how imbibed the system is that the revenge seems legit too – this I guaged from the hooting and clapping in support of the revenge, in the theater. This is such a gray social situation which is taken as black and white. Not one single person in the story takes a moment to understand why this intelligent woman took an irreversible step. The audience actually cheers when she is made to suffer for it. Even though the otherwise nice man is clearly using inappropriate means to get back to her. Even when the woman is completely trapped from all sides, despite being wronged – the audience cheered. I hope there were others in the audience who that there with clenched teeth like me.Either way, the movie gets you involved. This could so easily have become a social message film and you want to applaud it for not taking that route. But just when you begin to clap, your hands are held back by a ridiculous climax. The last 20-30 minutes of the film nosedives into an abyss and goes deeper and deeper right till the end. It seems the movie (if not the industry) has two types of writers and their skills are not interchangeable. You can either write the regular Hindi film drama or a layered account of characters and society. Just like not everyone can do the latter, looks like one who has accomplished the latter cannot write the ‘masala’ easily either. Stalking isn’t cute. Forcing someone into marriage is hardly romantic. And even if these things were cute and romantic, in some strange world, they make for an awful appendix to close a film, especially a thus-far, well-written film. And in any case, making marriage the be-all and end-all requirement for any couple and thus resolution for a film seems unreal. Especially when you get other snide comments about real-life society right such as men insisting that a woman cover her head with her duppatta (scarf) in a temple. The film peaks and should have stopped at that high. After that, the fall feels like you were betrayed. Or maybe the fall feels worse because of the high you are at. In any case, this one is yet another ‘alas’.

345,1045,1045,1045,1045,Shaala,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/shaala-review/,,5/5.0,,3.733333333,"A film that gently unfolds the travails faced by a young adolescent in love, Shala is simple, sweet and sincere. Perhaps not something that will be universally appreciated, Shala is nonetheless one of those films that needs to be lauded for its writing and treatment and most importantly, for Anshuman Joshi’s performance as the young teenager in love with his classmate. For a film-watching population that is starved of genuine stories drawn from the deepest recesses of human life, Sujay Dahake’s Shala comes as a whiff of fresh air. ","Imagine a 4-year-old, who has just learnt how to draw, making an anniversary card for his parents. That is Shala for you. It may not be the greatest thing to happen to the movies since Citizen Kane, but while it lasts, it makes you smile.Set in the 1970s in a village in Maharashtra, Shala is essentially a tale of teenage love. Mukund Joshi, a smart little 9th standard kid, harbours a crush on his pretty classmate Shirodkar. Sorted as he seems on the exterior, his life revolves around her. What makes Shala an immensely watchable film is that the writers – Milind Bokil (story) and Avinash Deshpande (screenplay) – show some genuine insight into what goes on in the mind of a teenage boy falling in what he knows is love.Mastering the art of stealing glances at her without drawing the attention of your classmates, joining the same tuition classes as she, that burning feeling you get when the teacher scolds her in front of everyone in class, the list is endless. The writers manage to capture a number of these tender moments in the script. These moments are further embellished because director Sujay Dahake (who has also edited the film) manages to eke out some endearing performances from the largely teenaged principal cast.The political backdrop of the film, by virtue of it being set during the emergency is what takes it a notch above the ordinary. While the implications of the political backdrop stay in the background, it casts its shadow on the movie throughout, particularly for Jitendra Joshi’s character.Cinematographer Diego Romero’s beautiful frames and the earthy colour palette make the film a visual treat. An ensemble supporting cast lends solid support and adds a measure of credibility to the film. Dilip Prabhavalkar as the school principal and Nandu Madhav as Joshi’s father stand out amongst the lot. Both fine actors, it is hard to imagine anyone else in these roles. Santosh Juvekar as the liberal-minded school teacher has mastered the art of over-acting within the limits of being endearing, and he doesn’t disappoint here as well. After Zhakaas, Amruta Khanvilkar, once again, looks pretty but is mis-cast. Ketaki Mategaonkar as Shirodkar is extremely charming. The choice of her as the girl who our young protagonist Joshi falls in love with must be lauded, because she isn’t pretty in a conventional sense, but in a rustic way. Her personality seems to make Joshi’s love for her seem that much more real.But ultimately, Shala is Joshi’s story and young Anshuman Joshi carries the film on his tiny but able shoulders. He is spontaneous, endearing and extremely confident. Make no mistake about it, the character of a teenage boy in love is a complex one. Young boys that age are rarely given credit for the troubles that they have to navigate through. Adolescence is tough to deal with, and Anshuman Joshi’s charming portrayal brings that to the fore wonderfully.What may work against the film is fact that it does take its time to make its point. The makers are in no hurry to tell their story and while that can put some people off, the fact remains that life rarely unfolds at the speed at which a Christopher Nolan film does. Perhaps you need to experience what Joshi does in this film to truly identify with him. Shala worked for me because it was a genuine, slice-of-life story, something that is rarely seen in Indian cinema today. Shala’s Joshi & Shirodkar may not join the likes of Rick & Ilsa or even Raj & Simran in terms of immortality, but they will ensure pure warmth and joy when you watch them share those sweet little moments in this charming little film.

Oh dear, how do I fit Barjatya in that sentence now?","I repeat, “Shaandaar is the Anees Bazmee-fication of Dharma-ised version of the Phantom-isation of Vikas Bahl's Disney tale. Oh dear, how do I fit Barjatya in that sentence now?” Shaandaar looks like it has been directed by six teams. To start with Vikas Bahl wanted to make a simple Disney story adding his flair of light, lively comedy. Since the setting was a big fat Sindhian wedding, it had to be the Barjatya way or the highway. The producers Phantom and Dharma brought in quirk and cheesiness respectively. How and why Anees Bazmee entered the equation has only one explanation. Their target audience was 100% of the film-watching population. And just in case you are wondering – no, it doesn't work. What does work is the lead performances – Shahid Kapoor, Alia Bhatt and Pankaj Kapoor and the songs' lyrics. It has been a long, long while since lyrics have caught my attention and kept it there. I shall buy the music for the lyrics. A shame though that the music doesn't live up to the craziness that the Vikas Bahl-Amit Trivedi duo had done an awesome job the last time they got together. So be it. Alia Bhatt bring her casual coolness to screen that is charming and you completely relate with Shahid Kapoor when he can't take his eyes off her. Shahid Kapoor himself with a very cursorily written character does a composed knight in shining armour with small weaknesses of his own. Pankaj Kapoor has his own brand of restraint that he brings here too. Some scenes with the real-life father-son duo were delightful indeed. Similarly, Shahid Kapoor and Alia Bhatt are great on screen together and could have had chemistry, had the writing allowed for it.While the trailer portrays the film quite literally as a fairy-tale romance, and the film leads you on with animated frogs, clouds, in the beginning. But, it soon becomes something else. Men wanting breaking free from their mother's tyranny. Women wanting to break free from the label, “obese”. Shaandaar also tries to trot about like a woman-empowering Queen, but doesn't manage to do that without her male leads. Undoubtedly, it is a mish-mash of ideologies, of film-making aesthetics. I cannot shake off the big question mark – why? Why would a perfectly sane director go about doing this? You can't even call this experimentation because individually every thing that the film does has been done before. Maybe, true to the film's theme – it was not a film, it was a business deal. These individual experiments too are stretched out not only beyond the point that they are novel/funny/engaging but also beyond their tolerable time limit. All stretching to a stretched out climax that is truly difficult to sit through given the director and cast. Maybe this film could've worked if it was an hour shorter, but we'll have to see it to know it. The outtakes in the end credit show that there was much more that didn't make it to the final cut. Looks like the crew had loads of fun. Thank you for keeping us out of it.

Could be watched for its director and theme.,"Shab is a long-drawn-out study of alienation manifested through its four main characters: Mohan aka Azfar (Ashish Bisht), Neil (Areesz Gandhi), Benoit (Simon Freney) and Afia (Arpita Pal). Neil is an outsider by virtue of his sexuality, while the others are literally from out of town, and have complex realities. They face further alienation as a consequence of their romantic and sexual exploits, and victories and defeats thereof.The line between romantic and sexual pursuits is thin. All the characters have overstepped it at least once, and have been pushed back to the other side. It is on this side that they cross paths and resonate as if they were mirror images of each other: Benoit and Neil are grieving silently, while Afia and Mohan are leading double lives. Amongst all four, Afia is pivotal--the connector, the spine. And to maintain that, Onir guards her mystery so painstakingly and for so long, that it fails to matter when it is revealed. The protractedness is tiring.That's not all. For most of its run time, the film appears like a portfolio/showreel of good looking actors, framed and lit beautifully in long, mid and close up shots. All it offers in the name of a narrative are events that are loosely put together using long takes of the brooding actors set against the backdrop of a bustling city. I get it. It is through these shots that Onir portrays alienation. But, there are too many, and it gets repetitive.Every once in a while Onir tries to break the monotony with situational humor, probably based on instances from real life, but they seem forced and thus the jokes are mostly lost.In terms of editing, there is no obvious pattern to how much of a character will appear on the screen and in which order. It helps keep the interest alive - the film is like a box of chocolates. The traditional cause-and-effect correlation between subsequent shots is avoided. A cause may not have an immediate effect or the effect may be revealed much later. It is an interesting challenge to undertake. However, at times it creates jumps that are big and jar the continuity. Also, for the longest time, Mohan's story overshadows others', including Afia's, challenging her centrality. However, it also allows two actors to showcase their prowess:  newcomer Ashish Bisht steals the scenes with his looks and uninhibited presence before the camera. The senior actor cast opposite him, Raveena Tandon, looks gorgeous and gives a refreshingly restrained and steady performance.The music and background score seem secondary to the cinematography, which, figuratively speaking, hogs the limelight. After years one hears KK render a song, and even though memories of Rockford and Jhankar Beats come rushing back, his voice seems out of place. It is loud and unsuited for the tone of this movie, as compared to the soft and rustic voice of Arijit Singh, which we have got so used to these days.What enhanced the sense of alienation for me is that I watched the film in a starkly empty theater. Luckily, I had a friend for company or the feeling of alienation would have doubled. :-p But, chuckles apart, it is sad because I remember My brother...Nikhil, Onir's directorial debut, was met with a hugely encouraging response. I Am was crowd funded and won two national awards in 2012. Enter 2017, and there's no one in the theater to watch Shab. Not even out of curiosity. Odd!Well, truth be told, the film is erratic in engaging and evoking empathy. Some parts are endearing, and a lot of it might seem extra. It has an interesting premise and innovative structure, and the music prevails through its jump cuts, creating a sense of unison, but the film drags at a slow pace. At 150 minutes it seems way too long. It could have told the same story more emphatically if some parts (mostly in the second half) were edited out. That said, the film could be watched for its director, Onir, and its theme. Only sensitive filmmakers will pick up themes like alienation.

350,1050,1050,1050,1050,Shahid,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review32 Critic Reviews 5/5.0 2 Reader Reviews 5/5.0 69 Tweet Reviews 5.0/5.0,/movie/shahid-review/,5/5.0,5/5.0,5.0/5.0,5.0,"Hansal Mehta’s latest film Shahid, based on the life of slain defense lawyer Shahid Azmi, is a powerful story about a man who stood up for what he believed in and paid the price for it. Powered by the belief of the director and a convincing cast that manages to suck you in, the film is the kind that will stay with you long after the lights turn back on. ","If I had to pick one Hindi film this year that shows the largest heart, that truly symbolizes the victory of sheer passion towards cinema and storytelling, then it would have to be Hansal Mehta’s comeback film after a hiatus, the touching and eye-opening Shahid. The film traces the real life story of criminal lawyer Shahid Azmi, who was murdered for his defense of a Muslim man accused of being an accomplice in 26/11. Shahid’s story begins when, as a youth living in Govandi (an eastern suburb in Mumbai) and traumatized by the Bombay riots of 1993, he flees to a jihadi camp for ‘training’. The conflict between his own interpretation of Islam and that of the ‘trainers’ at the camp forces him to come back to Bombay, albeit into the arms of the police. Then begins his journey on the path of justice, something that he believes in till the very end.Shahid Azmi’s story was clearly bursting to be told; a man who decided to fight for those who couldn’t fight for themselves; a man who paid the price of justice with his life. I’m glad that it was Hansal Mehta who was destined to bring his story back into public consciousness. After the interesting Dil Pe Mat Le Yaar and the truly underrated Chhal, a slew of highly forgettable films made a promising career head southwards. With Shahid, hopefully that career will head towards where it should.While the film’s biggest strength undoubtedly is the story of the Shahid himself, what really makes the cinematic version of it memorable is the cast of the film. Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub as Shahid’s older brother is excellent. He is the actor who played the role of Manu Sharma in the recent screen adaptation of Jessica Lal’s story. Anyone who loathed him then (because he was so good in the negative role) is bound to have a change of heart after this film. Prabhleen Sandhu as Shahid’s wife Mariam has a pleasing presence. Kay Kay Menon in a small, but significant cameo is an absolute delight to watch. One really misses this incredible actor. Tigmanshu Dhulia and Vipin Sharma in small roles are terrific, as are the rest of the supporting cast.But the film ultimately belongs to Raj Kumar Yadav, the man who plays the title role. He invests himself into the character with such aplomb that one can easily feel his helplessness, his confusion, his ambition, his purpose and the rough edges that the character has. With every single performance of his, Raj Kumar underlines the fact that he is one of the most talented and dynamic young actors India has today. Hopefully, filmmakers will be able to channel his talent and challenge him with even more complex roles.Strictly as a film, Shahid isn’t without its flaws. With budget and financial viability being perhaps the foremost reasons, the film suffers from technical and production-related problems. Right from issues like DSLR footage not blending in with the rest of the film, production value not being up to the standard that a film like this should ideally have had, to the fact that even though the film tracks nearly two decades of Shahid’s life, he doesn’t visually age at all – these problems stick out like thorns in the intense experience that the film otherwise is. Also, the film could and should have been crisper. Often, a lot of time is spent highlighting Shahid’s character traits, especially right at the start of the film and then later in the film. I’m not sure if this has some connection to the fact that the editor of the film, Apurva Asrani, is also one of the screenplay writers. Either way, shortening the film could possibly have strengthened its impact.Still, it isn’t often that the conviction and passion of the director and his team shines through in a film that clearly faced a number of obstacles in its making. Just for that, Shahid is a film that deserves to be seen on the big screen.

If I don't see the evil side, it scares me. If don't see the good side, what's my motivation to care? Shaitan doesn't explore any fights within, it's just one devil versus the other. If it weren't for the brilliant performances, Shaitan would look like it's Director, Bejoy nambiar and producer, Anurag Kashyap's urge to sew plainly written scenes with quirky treatments.","If there is only evil within you, there is nothing for you to struggle against. If you have no dilemmas, no internal conquests to make, you don't make interesting characters. If your characters don't interest me, I'm an audience tapping my feet, waiting for something unpredictable to happen. If you don't make anything unpredictable happen, I can only be awed so much by your slick cinematography, smart editing and pulsing background music. The point is there's an attempt to make the same point about our degenerating youth, in a different way. But style gets more than its share, and the dry runs of trying to shock, fail.And yet just the performances make this film worth a watch. It makes you sit up and take notice. All of them from a short role by Raj Kumar Yadav to the main characters played by Shiv Pandit, Gulshan Devaiya, Kirti Kulhari, Neil Bhoopalam, and of course Rajeev Khandelwal. We always knew Kalki Koechlincan play the doped out, girl-woman. Here you see another facet. The one with perfect comic timing. Sure, she has some awesome one-liners. And her character has a sense of humor darker than mine (yes, I have an inflated opinion about my dark sense of humor). Kalki takes being an insensitive bitch to the next level.And that's the best the writers do. The odd one-liner. Where's the depth that will engross you in the characters? The twists that will make you sit on the edge? There's a quip in my native language, marwadi, which translates to - Don't you trust your fate/luck? Usually used when someone's eating as if there's no tomorrow. Looks like director, Bejoy Nambiar doesn't trust his fate. Which is why he put in everything he thought is quirky in this one film - whether it belonged or not0. Lest he didn't get another chance. One example, Amy's (Kalki) excuse for being cold is shown to us in a fairy-tale like atmosphere. That just doesn't fit in with the otherwise morbid story-telling. Maybe this was just wrong judgment. Everyone is allowed a few of those.But there are more such examples. Dark characters find themselves in a spot that couldn't possibly get tighter. At this point, Bejoy breaks the fourth wall, has a character talk to the camera and have text superimposed on the screen!? Totally rocks the boat you've settled yourself in. Maybe, just maybe, this was intentional. Maybe the characters have lost their marbles and can't think straight anymore. Maybe, the youth that Bejoy seems to be commenting on is so beyond redemption that they can only find comedy in the great tragedy they have created. I'd have given that benefit of doubt if the rest of the writing supported it. Can killing someone by accident make you callous enough to kill at will?Without a doubt, the situation that Khoya Khoya Chand is set to is brilliantly edited. And for once I liked the use of slow motion in a song (ahem!). Yet, it looked more like a part of Bejoy's showreel rather than his Shaitan.Yes, each one of us has a devil that has made us its home. Yes, we need to fight it constantly to make this world livable. Yes, it's a beautiful concept that needs to be explored in Hindi cinema. Yes, it remains so.

Shubh Mukherjee has written, directed and is the lead actor. The angles chosen, especially in the beginning of the film, are stylish but are a complete misfit for a comedy that is about four friends who are suspected as terrorists and there are real terrorists lurking around. This one-line description is all you know for most of the first half. Nothing new happens except the same characters repeat the same questions and stories and fart jokes. Actually, the toilet humor is some of the worst - yes, even worse than Delhi Belly. Do people really laugh at urine being sprayed around? Disgusting.For all you know this might be the writer/director's tribute/reference to the film. Because there are enough number of those strewn through the film - each one of them contrived, painful and out-of-place. In fact, the writing is abysmal for a comedy. There might be a spot or two that make you smile because the silliness is getting too out-of-hand. The actors are all loud without exception - even after you've accepted that the genre supposedly demands raw noise. Shakal Pe Mat Ja is a tiring experience at twenty minutes over two hours.

Is it too much to ask for at least one hummable tune or a watchable song? I am sane enough not to ask for average performances or a sensible script.,"This movie is about the rivalry between two music composers based in New York. The key word here is 'two'. Who wins when you have Himesh Reshammiya Vs. Himesh Reshammiya? Don't know about that. But, I surely know who loses. Us! Mind you, we are supposed to believe that one of them is actually a genius. All this while there is absolutely nothing for you to distinguish one composition from the other. I was thoroughly amused when Reggie (Upen Patel) taunts AJ (Bobby Deol) for having silly lyrics to his tunes. Actually, he was just stating facts. But I burst out laughing when he starts singing his own lyrics. They were equally bland! All obviously written by none other than Sameer. Now, we have started rhyming across songs - 'jhoom jhoom' to 'boom boom'.The least you can do when you set out to make a musical is provide entertainment via visually appealing songs. Better use of colors would have added infinitely to the experience. How about having decent choreographers or casting better dancers? Of all the people, Bobby Deol?!? Maybe that is why the camera man was getting all enthusiastic, so that we would not be able to focus on the aerobics in the disguise of dancing. Speaking of the camera - the close-ups were way too many. Okay, granted, the only reason for Kangna Ranaut and Celina Jaitley to be in the movie was for the curves they are endowed with, and the catwalk they have picked up in the name of body language. But, if you are going to show their face in close-ups, I mean, if that's what you really want to do, can we at least have the complete face with chin and all. On a side note, Kangna's eye make-up was the worst I have seen in a long time. And Celina refuses to give a whole-hearted smile lest it spoil her make-up.I am totally convinced now that Upen, Kangna and Celina come from the school of under-acting where, you know, they teach you the all-in-one expression and punish you if you move your eyelid more than a quarter of a centimeter (except for blinking). And Bobby Deol comes from the school of over-acting, where acting is all about yelling and imposing melodrama on the audience. Oooh! Does that mean we have perfect performances as an average then? Never mind...The script has the lousiest characterizations, which alas, we cannot blame because the characters are lousy! Egoistic psychopath Vs. Overconfident nincompoop. Anyways, you empathize with none and cheer when both of them find their way to the hospital for some reason or the other. The shoddy screenplay doesn't help at all. Some scenes look like they were thought of first and squeezed into the movie because they seemed cool, e.g., the fire scene.Honestly, the basic premise of the story - competitors trying to outsmart each - other - could have been a compelling watch. Especially, if they had dwelled upon the psyche of the self-acclaimed genius who is actually mediocre. But, the basic premise is left at that. It finds support in none of the other aspects of film-making. We, thus, are left with a product which has no head or tail - and you could be accused of high expectations if you wanted anything like reason or logic.
Borrowing a line from the movie, ""What you don't know, does not exist"". How I wish that I did not know about this movie and that in turn would make it not exist...

354,1054,1054,1054,1054,Shamitabh,Watch when on TV/online,wogma reviewPreview1 Reader Review 0/5.0,/movie/shamitabh-review/,,0/5.0,,1.5,"A tribute to a baritone, Shamitabh serves well for the voice's fans. Unfortunately, stretches imagination and its length a tad much making it repetitive and tiring.","Once again a Hindi film makes me refer to a Marathi essay I wrote in my ninth standard. After a six-page long journey by the solider in my “Autobiography of a Soldier”, he was abruptly released because the captors got frustrated with his silence, or like my teacher put it, the writer got bored of writing. Shamitabh's second half suffers on similar grounds, more so the climax. In addition to the technical mumbo-jumbo in the first half, even if short, is just too convenient. So, despite an attempt at a storyline different from the routine,  a lot of the writing comes across as the writers got bored and had to do some patch job to get from point A to point B. A baritone as wonderful as it is, and performances that keep you interested, make Shamitabh a just about decent watch. Shamitabh lingers a little too much, and not in the artistic, let-the-audience-take-it-in kind of a way. To the contrary, the extra moments it stays on say Rekha's face when she hears a familiar voice, actually seem to be asking the audience, “Get it? Get it?”In fact, there was a point early in the film, where I was amused by how this old man Amitabh is being disciplined like a child by the twenty-somethings, almost like they were his parents. And lo and behold, there was a scene later in the film, that makes sure you get it. A few other Bollywood real life references, from Amitabh Bachchan's dislike for the nomenclature Bollywood to a bus conductor rising to stardom, R. Balki sprinkles the film with nods to the industry. It is cute while it lasts, but, like always references like these divert your attention from the film's story to the fact that it is a film. Same goes for product placements, as “justifiable” as they may be, are only blatant. With two struggling actors and a struggling director at the center, it is inevitable that Shamitabh point at at least some things wrong with the industry. From rigged award ceremonies to actors who speak for and against those depending on whether or not they got the award to actors taking control over other aspects of film-making, Shamitabh does its bit. External references and advertisements aside, techinical glitches and forced writing aside, at its heart Shamitabh is a war of brittle egos. Amitabh Sinha, the old, haggered and cranky failed actor from four decades ago is unsurprisingly wonderfully played by Amitabh Bachchan. It stumps me every time, he comes on screen two things happen – he chews the scene and yet all you can see is the character he is playing, in this case the arrogant, drunkard. It is commendable indeed that both Dhanush and Akshara Haasan hold their own in his presence. Even so, Dhanush's talent seemed under-explored and Akshara was good when she had to play herself – a young, aspirational, assistant director. The moment she is asked to do something “filmy”, she slips and so does the scene. The guy who plays Amitabh's chaperon has a screen presence of his own too. Unforunately, the theme of ego clashes between voice and face, man and man,  one being incomplete without the other seems like a side. As is evident with what I felt like bringing up first about the film, the things that bothered rather than the concept that is rich by itself but is left unexplored. While I am a huge fan of the voice and was rapt every time I heard it; while I am a huge fan of the man to an extent that he is one of the few people I think who has earned the right to be arrogant; while I think if there is a personality whose career deserves a film, it is him – I'd like to see it in a documentary or a film that is blatantly about that. Not in a film that is masked as a story about how incomplete the voice is without a face while clearly being overwhelmed by the voice.

355,1055,1055,1055,1055,Shanghai,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewNotepadPreview38 Critic Reviews 4.3/5.0 5 Reader Reviews 4/5.0 52 Tweet Reviews 3.5/5.0,/movie/shanghai-review/,4.3/5.0,4/5.0,3.5/5.0,3.933333333,"Visually appealing because of raw, rugged ambience and characters, Shanghai ultimately ends up being yet another political drama that chooses the quick-fix, short-cut. In a film that has shades in characters that are unique to Hindi cinema, the patch-up job in the writing of the climax is a serious let down.","We as a people want progress. We as a people are disturbed when a section of the society is wronged to achieve this progress. When it comes to 'our' progress, we as a people don't mind collateral damage. Dibakar Banerjee's Shanghai, portrays our aspirations as a people to want to be a 'progressive' nation. A deep concept, with multi-layered connotations and meaningful characters starts seeming half-baked post half-time and is made utterly regular by the end. The age ol' nexus between business, politics, law and administration is yet again scratched and left at just that. What is 'realistic' to the eye ceases to be realistic to the brain after teasing you with details and references that you aren't otherwise used to in a Hindi film.
A guy from the 'good' side is a professor, a rebel, fighting on behalf of the wronged and has a thing for his female students - that's what you aren't used to in a Hindi film. A strong female protagonist whose father is implicated in a multi-crore Rupee scam finds herself helpless, has fallen for her married teacher, and yet manages to create empathy towards her - that's what you aren't used to in a Hindi film. A typical politician who genuinely believes in and is concerned about the leader of his party, despite being powerful in his own right - that's what we aren't used to in a Hindi film. For goodness sake, an Emraan Hashmi whose acting capabilities are explored - that's what you are not used to in a Hindi film! And yet by the end you come out feeling that the writers tried to pull wool over your eyes with all of these interesting departures and came up with a sham of an over-simplified climax.  
Some things are pleasantly surprising. Sub-plots begin and are left without resolution; you are told things about characters and their inter-relationships using subtlest of details just because - for no apparent reason in terms of the story - these things lend to the beauty of the film and its inherent chaos. Many a time, Dibakar Banerjee chooses to pause, take a breather, gives an extra moment to take the ambience in and these moments strike a chord between the audience and the characters.  
That the characters are played by some fine actors only adds to its believability. That Abhay Deol could have sleep-walked as the taken-for-granted senior bureaucrat who is struggling with his conscience only means that we have begun to take his acting skills for granted. I do wish though that his generic South Indian accent was given a pass. Emraan Hashmi, you have to watch, I ain't elaborating on how cool it is to see him so comfortable with something so out of his regular zone. Kalki Koechlin gets to do a repeat of her strong-lady-in-distress role. 
The smaller roles though are the ones that really stick in Shanghai. From Pitobash Tripathi who has his own kind of screen presence to Prosenjit Chatterjee and Supriya Pathak whose omnipresence is felt throughout despite really short roles to Farouque Shaikh whose presence is strangely comforting to even Anant Jog who plays one of the few representatives of the people who are wronged and are being manipulated by politicians. 
The problem then comes back to the cop-out of a climax, one that is build up towards really well. And there are other details that seem out of place. For example, the satire in the lyrics of 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' sound more like it'll be sung by the protestors rather than supporters of the ruling party. Yet, interesting, fairly relatable characters are staged on a familiar stage - that of corruption, red-tape and dishonesty. A system that you and I are frustratingly trapped in we want to see the characters wade out of it so that we see light for ourselves. But from this realistic milieu you are thrown into reality - that this is still fiction and life is obviously not going to be as easy as it is for these characters. 
It boils down to this then - what makes a movie good for you? What are you ok with letting go off, if the rest of it got you hooked? If what you are looking for is some serious, no-nonsense drama, most of Shanghai has it for you. But, if you end up disappointed when build-up towards the climax remains unsatiated, you will come out with that upset feeling. You know where I am.

356,1056,1056,1056,1056,Sharyat,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/sharyat-review/,,5/5.0,,4.266666667,"Sharyat is a film whose strongest point is its technique. Rarely does one see a Marathi film where pains have been taken to make sure that the film looks good. With the backdrop of bullock cart races in rural Maharashtra, Sharyat has a nice, rustic feel to it, some strong characters and most importantly, some impressive production, considering it is a Marathi film. However, the mediocre screenplay pulls the film in the opposite direction. The weak script notwithstanding, Sharyat is a film that you won’t regret watching, primarily because of its look and feel, its interesting premise and the character of the protagonist, played by Sachin Pilgaonkar.","Sharyat made an impact on me with its posters itself – with Sachin Pilgaonkar’s fiery look and the rustic feel that I got from it. While the film itself will definitely not re-write cinematic history, Sharyat is an important film for Marathi cinema. Finally, technique in Marathi cinema seems to be coming of age.Sharyat has some impressive production, looks slick in spite of the village setting, and also manages to squeeze in a few Matrix-esque bullet-time shots. True, there are times when the technique seems over-done. There is an overdose of motion blurs and ramped jib movements, and the film often appears excessively colour-corrected. However, I’m willing to overlook this in the interest of the larger picture – no one can say that technique hasn’t reached the shores of Marathi cinema. Directed and co-written by Viju Mane, Sharyat firstly needs to be lauded for its choice of theme. It revolves around the traditional bullock cart races that are held in rural Maharashtra, and the fierce battles that ensue to gain a specific honour that victory in the annual races bestows. Sachin plays Dhananjay, an ace bull racer who hasn’t raced in five years because of a tragedy that forced him to leave the village altogether. Circumstances bring life a full circle for him, as he has to race yet again for a multitude of reasons. The film, not surprisingly, has its share of flaws, its screenplay being the biggest. It could have been far more taut even in its main plot; a half-baked love-story on the side makes it worse. Thus, in spite of the fact that the film’s runtime is just a shade over two hours, it stills seems longer than it needed to be. It is also often prone to some over the top drama and inane plot twists.Adding to the film’s woes are three unnecessary songs - two item numbers (one of them with a particularly derivative and silly hook line) and one romantic song (which incidentally looks a lot like ‘Ishq Sufiyana’ from The Dirty Picture.) The songs themselves are fairly ordinary. The only memorable song in the entire film is the title track ‘Sharyat Lagli’. It is catchy and is placed well in the film. While there are no major complaints with regards to the performances in the film, I often found myself wishing for Sachin’s dialogue delivery to be a little less stilted and stoic. He has a great intensity and completely looks the part. But there were times when the way he delivered his dialogue just didn’t do justice to the emotion in his eyes. Sachin Juvekar, who plays Sachin’s brother, is mostly endearing, with the occasional tendency to go over the top. Veteran Marathi film and TV actor, Neena Kulkarni (also a known face in Hindi films) plays her part well. Tejashree Pradhan is pleasant, but has a truly insignificant role.Which brings me back to the technique. Marathi films, by their sheer lack of commercial viability, will never be able to match the scale and technique of Hindi or Tamil films. In fact, these days even the average budget of a Malayalam film is significantly higher than that of a Marathi film. While that truly is a pity, the bright side of it is that Marathi filmmakers are forced to stretch every rupee to try and make their films ‘look good’. For that reason alone, Sharyat (reportedly made at a budget of about 3 crore) is a film to be proud of. In spite of all of its glaring flaws which otherwise could have put me off, Sharyat is a film that I don’t regret spending money on, because I could see the filmmaker’s intent to make sure that no one could look at this film and say that Marathi films are shoddily produced. Hopefully, Sharyat will set a new precedent for technique in Marathi cinema.

It doesn't help that Lisa Haydon seems to be playing dumb, but looks too smart to be playing so dumb. That's not to say, that they don't act well. At least the men. They do their jobs well enough to creep out any woman in their vicinity - both on screen and in the audience.I don't really have much more to say about this one except that I had to keep comparisons with my all-time worst film ever, *Buddha Mar Gaya * at bay.

That in itself is a rarity. While it might not rise up to the standards of ""A few good men"", it has its intense moments that work.","Yes, it most certainly is a rehash of A few good men. The context has been Indianized effectively. And this despite including Indian movie-making elements like melodrama, out-of-context absolutely-unnecessary songs, difficult-to-digest climax, etc. The Rob Reiner courtroom drama is more about its characters, Shaurya is more about the issue it is trying to highlight. I would say the best way to appreciate the latter is by blocking out the former. After all, even if Kay Kay Menon is no Jack Nickolson, he still is Kay Kay Menon. Not impossible. Give it a try. Most of the first half is spent in building characters and you hardly know a fact or two about the case, army lawyer Major Siddhant (Rahul Bose), has to handle. Very deliberately then, the movie moves on to the strong point it wants to make - egos of people in power need to be punished for misusing that power to dominate over minorities (women, religious minorities, etc). This is, of course, done using only one of the minorities as a case in point. But the general application is confirmed when you read about various such cases where the same principle can be applied. It takes courage but it needs to be done.In my mind, it takes courage just to cast Jaaved Jaaferi in a non-slapstick role. It's no earth-shattering performance, but a mere exchange of glances showcases what this man is capable of. Rahul Bose with his casual-cum-sincere demeanor makes you believe the transformation his character goes through despite the gaps in the script. That you feel like slapping Brigadier Rudra Pratap Singh for his overconfidence and high-strung attitude, says it all about Kay Kay Menon. Now, why overacting is reserved for the women, is beyond me. Of course, I am not asking the men to overact too. But, it really makes me wonder about the kind of women moviemakers have in their lives? They get shrill to express excitement (Minissha Lamba) and are exaggeratedly listless when they are sad (Seema Biswas). Besides that, Shaurya's characters become believable not because of the way they are etched and shaded-in but because of the dialogues each of them is given. Each character is strongly opinionated but very rarely does one choose to lecture the other or the audience. The conversational tone might have a lot to do with the camera angles and compositions chosen. Tight close-ups or just having the speaking person in frame has been noticeably avoided. This makes it look more like a dialogue rather than a monologue even though there are relatively long monologues throughout the movie. Other than that the coverage of the scenic beauty, the editing, and the background music are very below average. Abrupt cuts are very disctracting. And did loud compositions ever work in displaying the character's internal conflicts? Had these things been a bit better, Shaurya would be a crispier, tighter output. Nevertheless, the story and dialogues supporting the story are strong enough to make a case for this one.

Their battles of wit, scream of mutual respect, yet you can see each of them scheme in their heads. The act of out-witting the other is the motto of the film. Intersperse this with energized, edgy chase scenes and you have the perfect end to a volatile cinematic year. ","The Sherlock Holmes I grew up with was overtly English, Victorian in his dressing, a schematic mastermind and a detective with the magical powers to solve anything. Blame it on the BBC adaptations or the selective reading of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s work, but nowhere did he figure in my head as an action figure. In Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, however, a different web is spun: one of homoerotic camaraderie, eccentric, super-hero sequences of Holmes and Watson saving the world, or ummm, the situation at hand (with their physical grit, and not so much their detective powers). In the second part of Ritchie’s adaption of the age-old classic, Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr. reprise their roles as Watson and Holmes, respectively to outsmart their conniving rival Dr. Moriarty. Theirs is a battle of the intellect – its 1891, and Moriarty’s main agenda is to scheme and destroy, at the backdrop of the tension between France and Germany. He aims to use his intellect in ways that will reinforce his power. Jared Harris as Moriarty is at his curled-lip, sinister best. Holmes on the other hand, is shown using very little of his intellect. Downey Jr. as Holmes spends much of his screen time in bizarre disguises and mumbling what one could have only hoped was genius calculations.Oh, but you do smile. Once you learn to ignore the (yummy) homoerotic subtext between Watson and Holmes in this version, you manage to dreamily watch the two as they spill with love for one another. Because Law and Downey Jr.  could give Bogart and Bergman a run for their money. You almost forget about Rachel McAdams (as Irene Adler) and Noomi Rapace (as Simza the gypsy fortune teller, also the lead in the Swedish, Girl With the Dragon Tattoo) – but not quite always. Stellar star cast; they act as perfect catalysts to the munificent characters of Holmes and Watson.Their witty repartee acts as a charismatic breather between the high-voltage, testosterone-induced action through the film. You can see them not getting enough of one another, playing it up like a little tease meant only for the indulgent audiences’ eye. One can trust Ritchie to turn things around, and how. I’m told, after a long discussion with a Sherlock Holmes expert, that Ritchie’s adaption of Holmes and Watson are very close to the books. That Holmes is as eccentric and babbling as we see in this film, and together he and Watson are almost super-hero like in their demeanor. I checked, only to find that Watson had an army training past, and Holmes has been trained in Martial Arts. And I was impressed. Ofcourse the film has Guy Ritchie stamped all over it. This adaptation, unique as it may be, does have its clear establishing moments. Coupled withZimmer’s background score (not his best, but one that provides the signature feelers for high-intense scenes), mad scientists, gypsies and stylistically treated 72-frames per second action, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is feisty and delectable. If you were looking for the more cognitive version of the series, you always have the BBC version (featuring Benedict Cumberbatch).Ritchie makes sure in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, entertainment is elementary.

""Commerce?"" - cool, you can do a CA, ICWA (MBA was a little too much to think of for a ""girl"" from my community). 
""Science?"" - oh excellent. Engineers, Doctors, they have a lot of 'scope'. 
""Arts?"" - Why would you do that to yourself? You are smart, intelligent, you scored well. No one talks about mere mortals. 
I went on to finish my CA, never practiced accountancy, and years later figured I'd like to watch movies and write about them. Only then did I know, there were actual books and courses I could have done that were closer to this field. 
Who do I blame? The system? Parents? Myself? A film that touches upon this theme, is sure to touch a chord within me, but…Shikshanachya aaicha gho says the system and over-ambitious, misguided parents are responsible. Fair enough. What's the solution? They haven't given a practical way to resolve this. I understand that the onus of providing a solution does not lie on a movie, but without that the film was seriously hollow. I'm told what I already know in a loud and brash manner. It doesn't really make me want to think about it after I'm out of the theater. Let alone take action to correct the wrong. What it does though is that it involves you in most parts for the two hours that you are there. You want to reach out to the guy who's heart is in cricket but is forced to learn 12*6. You want to shake his dad awake for cornering his boy thus. But, the resolution to the conflict comes very conveniently and harshly. In its way, the film tries to tell the parent, ""Look at what had to happen for you to realize you are wrong!"" And when the 'happy realization' dawns upon him, it creates an unrealistic monster. Reaching out to the higher ups in the system is surely a way, to correct the situation. But they make the system look unbelievably approachable. However, I liked the fact that our suffering parent was surrounded by the nicest of people. He had neighbors who'd help and money-sharks, who reached out to him. While it could be a little too good to be true, but I'd like to believe that the world is not that bad-a-place after all. Example, I have good neighbors, so there's no reason for a film to not have them. But barring that, the other stuff in the film, like the acting and dialogue, are more than annoying. The dialogue and the ""preachy"" tone in which it is delivered in has a very specific theatrical quality, which doesn't work in a film. Similarly, the acting looks more like it is for a live audience.While many of us would find the issue close to heart, somehow it lacked the depth and thought to seep deep into me. Though you see the angst that the makers and the characters might be feeling, it doesn't take you further. It's unfortunate, but it is a good start-off point for better films on this topic.

The theme about Chinese immigrants and their struggle is a familiar one in Hong Kong cinema; remember Return of the Dragon, and the much more fiery Fist of Fury, both starring the Kung Fu legend Bruce Lee? In both these films, Lee arrives to help out his fellow Chinese; in the first one as they struggle to run a restaurant in Rome and in the second as they come into conflict with the Japanese. Both these films were out and out action films, and Fist of Fury, is possibly Bruce Lee’s greatest film, showcasing his coiled body and lightning fast martial arts moves. Jackie Chan is all subdued and droopy in Shinjuku incident; he adopts a despondent and woebegone persona throughout and rarely smiles. His performance is just above average, one gets slightly tired of his despair, and in the climax he indulges in a lot of shouting, which does not go down too well. The first half of the film tries to set up the main characters, but unfortunately barring one or two, none of them are fleshed out well. We remember only the Japanese cop, Inspector Kitano, and Jie. The screen play tries to weave in too many elements about the immigrants’ lives; their desperation and their struggle for money, as well as the threats and challenges that they face. Somehow it does not come together cleanly, it seems a bit forced and artificial. 
The first half of the film also feels quite incongruous; maybe it is because we need time to adjust to Jackie Chan in his different role, or possibly it is because the frames are bright, clean, and plastic, even when what is sought to be portrayed is the grime and dirt of the city’s mean streets. The intercutting of the present with a bucolic past could also be another factor. The dubbed dialogue in English does not help either. The film picks up after it has dispensed with all the initial relationship building; we sense that the director is far more comfortable once the film enters crime territory. The story then moves along with quite a brisk pace, detailing the machinations and power play that ensue. The transition of Jackie Chan’s character is dealt with in a few sequences, and is not really completely believable. A love interest is also present and in what seems to be a remarkable coincidence, Bingbing Fan who plays Lily, seems to resemble Nora Miao (Bruce Lee’s heroine in all three of his Hong Kong films). 
The climax is the film’s strength, shot in low light and grainy frames (possibly to serve as a contrast to what came earlier), it is violent, brutal, and poignant. Swords are thrust through throats, knives used casually to sever and stab, and stones bludgeon and kill. Brian De Palma’s Scar Face was all about the immigrants’ distortion of the American dream; this film has neither the intensity nor the performances to grip you viscerally and make you lament the tragic hero. It tries hard, but instead remains just average. It is worth a watch though, simply for Jackie Chan’s attempt to go “serious”. PS And is this Jackie Chan’s first sex scene or what? Blink and you will miss it!

362,1062,1062,1062,1062,Ship of Theseus,Owner's Pride!,wogma review29 Critic Reviews 4.7/5.0 4 Reader Reviews 5/5.0 94 Tweet Reviews 4.9/5.0,/movie/ship-theseus-review/,4.7/5.0,5/5.0,4.9/5.0,4.866666667,"Anand Gandhi’s debut feature Ship of Theseus is a thought-provoking, emotionally and intellectually moving cinematic experience, one that Indian cinema can be proud of. For those who believe that they have the right to firmly hold on to their brains while experiencing movie-magic, Ship of Theseus won’t let you down. It talks about universal themes like the meaning of existence, and it does so without resorting to indulgence or pseudo-intellectualism. All I can really say about it is ask of it, and you shall receive.","There are indie films and there are indie films. And then there is writer-director Anand Gandhi’s Ship of Theseus. Perhaps the singularly most impressive independent film to come out of India, Ship of Theseus is a sweeping philosophical, intellectual and emotional experience that demands the audiences’ involvement from the very outset and in return rewards them with questions, answers and everything in between.The film traces three separate stories - three threads of life, ideology, spirituality and thought – into journeys that shake up the very basis of their characters’ separate existences. A female photographer whose talent and fame stem from a very unique circumstance – a physical disability that few would be able to overcome in such a positive manner; a monk whose ideological beliefs – that of non-violence and animal rights – face a stern test of faith; a young stockbroker whose notions of morality begin to spiral inwards as he unwittingly gets drawn into an illegal kidney trade racket. Anand Gandhi makes us dwell in these characters’ minds and inhabit their worlds, makes us get to know their worldview intricately and, most importantly, he makes us a part of the journey that these characters have to undertake. And these journeys don’t have a definite end – you just live with the characters long enough to know that, for better or for worse, their experiences have changed them.Another thing that fascinated me about the film at a far more personal level was how the entire film breathes Mumbai. The stories themselves could have been set in any city in the world – they are universal. But - and I am only speculating here - it appears that Anand Gandhi shares a bond with the city of Mumbai that reflects in how it is just always present, gently undulating under the surface of the film. What helps the film immensely is the cast. Though they are largely unknown faces in Indian cinema, each of them is convincing. Aida El-Kashef, Neeraj Kabi and Sohum Shah play the three main characters mentioned earlier. Each of them is so convincing in their roles that it often doesn’t seem like they are playing characters at all. Their presence and spontaneity play in a large role in drawing the audience’s involvement into the film. Also a host of charming supporting characters that are wonderfully performed are like icing on the cake.While the film can clearly hold its own at the international stage in terms of thought, what makes it even more special is that even technically, one doesn’t feel that the film can’t compete internationally. Pankaj Kumar’s cinematography needs to be lauded for that. Each of the stories has its own visual language specific to the character and his or her environment, and yet they merge beautifully in the larger context of the film. Yes, I did feel that the film could easily have had a crisper cut. There is an excess of visuals that makes the film a tad too long. Personally, I would perhaps have shaved off a good 10 – 15 minutes of the film to make it tauter. Perhaps the best thing about Ship of Theseus is that it has introduced Anand Gandhi to the world. Clearly, he is a man who thinks – a rare breed in Indian cinema. As many brain-dead people and films we come across, there are an equal number of pseudo-intellectual cinephiles with an unfounded conviction in what they believe is good cinema. It takes a passionate, philosophical thinker to understand that rules - and how to break them - are decided by human beings. Right and wrong are constructs of the human mind. Morality and justice always have two sides to it, just like the inseparable duality of life and death. Gandhi talks about all these themes in his film, hopefully the first of many more to come. Hopefully, it will also inspire and spawn the rise of more independent, thinking filmmakers. Just for this hope that he has instilled into us, with the arrival of Ship of Theseus, we as lovers of cinema must rejoice.

A disgusting experience. Not just because of the toilet humor. But more, because you just can't get over the ""How could SUCH an awful film be made?"" feeling even after an hour of having watched the film. A film that tries too hard to get cute. ","I was in tears, out of boredom. It hurts when you find a film disgusting enough that it gets to your nerves. It is not about mindless slapstick or the quality of humor, it is more about of the lack of anything at all - complete absence of any thought put in creating a half-decent product. Especially, when there was more than enough potential given a middle-aged Parsi couple. Also, there are a couple of interesting dilemmas to play with. But none are taken too seriously and are in fact, left unaddressed. All you can do then, is shake your head in despair. Usually a 'How can anyone..."" question is pretty vain. The most obvious answer is – ""well, like they just did..."" But Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi makes it difficult to control from asking a series of such questions. How could Sanjay Leela Bhansali write such an incoherent story? How could every one involved in the film not see how tedious it was getting? How could they make a film less than two hours feel so long? How could anyone think Farah Khan could act?!The lady talks like she does as a judge in one of the reality shows. Same tone, same expression, plain flat. Any attempt at changing the expressions seem forced and affected. Shirin Farhad... almost felt like it was to make true Farah Khan's childhood wish of playing the lead in a school play, she wasn't allowed to be a part of. Her way of telling the world, ""because I can do it!"" Fortunately, her off-timing can use the lame, predictable lines as an excuse. But, then almost all departments contribute in equal measure to the sinking ship. The songs win the race in taking it down faster. The point that the story tries to get at lacks power too – that some of us make an issue out of little things instead of focusing on the big picture. The narrative is so lackluster that the audience couldn't be bothered wit h it. Sure, Boman Irani tries his best to save the film with a lot of grace. But, all you want to do is give him a bear hug for having had to do this film. He must have his reasons, for how many directors/writers are going to go with him as the lead anchor of the film, despite all his capabilities? And for that the Bhansali brother-sister duo need to be applauded. It takes guts to have non-standard characters as leads, especially in a debut film. But, some points need to be taken off for having Boman Irani participate in this one. Also, the rest of the story is soporific and induces more yawns and snores than laughs. Except for the one or two 'funny lines' in the trailers, there's barely anything that can even induce a smile. And just when you think, ""yay! Just five minutes to go!"", you get a ""Did you think we can't make this worse?"" climax. A supposedly 'cute' romantic comedy with zero chemistry between the lead actors and many moments that want to make you bang your head on the closest wall rather than laugh – that is what Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi is all about.

Story that wavers in its focus. And long, way too long.","I love the Himalayas. I came back from a grueling trek in the Himalayan ranges a few months ago. One of the first lines Shivaay (Ajay Devgn) speaks resonated with my longing for the mountains. I identified with him when he said he can't leave the mountains. And that was the last thing likeable about the film. This is despite my admiration for Ajay Devgn's goofy, gloomy look. You can't watch a 3-hour long film for the mountains or that suave look, right? I'd rather watch a documentary on the Himalayas and have an Ajay Devgn poster to peek at, if I have to. Other than these two things, Shivaay is one long chase sequence. The story shuttles between it being a struggle for Shivaay to keep his daughter with him, a hunt for her when she is kidnapped and human-trafficking. The social cause seems like an afterthought. The story setup that gets Shivaay to Bulgaria seems too elaborate.  He could've just been any father looking for his daughter. Why the romantic track and the weird situation? It almost seems back-calculated to fit the kidnapping. And to make the film longer.The main purpose of the film then seems to be what it started as – a showreel for all people involved, the action choreographer, the cinematographer, the special effects team, the music department. And it would be one for Ajay Devgn's “I am so cool” look, if only it needed one. Abigail Eames, who plays Gaura, Shivaay's daughter is the only one who seems to have put her heart and soul into her act. Ajay Devgn sleepwalks through this one. Sayyeshaa and Erika Kaar are both stiff and awkward. Of course, it doesn't help that the latter has to speak Hindi. For an action film, there is nothing novel about the fight/chase sequences either. Except that they go on and on and on. This movie certainly did not need to be a minute over the 120-minute mark. In addition, you have predictable situations and tacky dialogue. The one thing I did not expect though, is the gratuitous sudden addition of a woman-in-a-tub song.Shivaay comes across as a film that wants to be more than a regular action film. It doesn't quite achieve anything there. On the other hand, it loses out on being an out and out crowd-pleasing action film too.

365,1065,1065,1065,1065,Shoeshine,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/shoeshine-review/,,,,3.5,"Winner of the first ever Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, Shoeshine is a gut-wrenching tale of two innocent, young boys who polish shoes for a living and thanks to a series of unfortunate events, are sent to juvenile prison. From Vittoria De Sica, the director of The Bicycle Thieves, this neo-realistic masterpiece will make you upset and sad, but that’s how you feel after watching films in this genre. Not recommended, if you want to be entertained, but certainly a great documentation of Italian kids to learn from.","The great Orson Welles (Citizen Kane) once famously remarked about Vittorio De Sica’s Shoeshine, “It was as if the camera disappeared, the screen disappeared. It was just life (unfolding in front of the audience).”You certainly get that feeling while watching Shoeshine, now considered one of the first cinematic gems to pioneer the neo-realism movement in films.Neo-realism, we learnt in college, is where an individual is a victim of the system, and although he tries to revolt against it and find a way around it, he hits a roadblock and becomes desperate and is eventually nailed down. My first brush with neo-realism was in The Bicycle Thieves, a film that I slept through the first time I saw it, but on second viewing I liked it so much, I became a De Sica fan for life. That’s what made me look up Shoeshine and his other films. One may say that majboori ka doosra naam Vittorio De Sica, because he was one of those rare film-makers who captured the desperation of the helpless and unemployed in heart wrenching stories.Shoeshine (Ragazzi) revolves around two young boys - Pasquale Maggi (Franco Interlenghi) and Guiseppe Fillipucci (Rinaldo Smordoni) - who shine shoes for a living and have collected just about enough money to buy a horse. However, a series of unfortunate events lands them in juvenile prison, where circumstances not only separate them, but also pit them against each other.It’s a touching story of the consequences of war and how the innocence of children is its first casualty. It’s a theme that even Iranian film-maker Bahman Ghobadi’s touched upon in Turtles Can Fly. Shoeshine however uses a much more mature brush to depict how unsuspecting kids become pawns in a larger criminal set-up and how this accentuates violence in their lives.De Sica doesn’t show these things in the Madhur Bhandarkar way - there’s no sensationalism about things - as Orson Welles puts it - you simply see life in a prison unfolding. Personally, I’m a sucker for prison dramas (The Shawshank Redemption being my favourite film, ever) and although Shoeshinedoesn’t make any startling revelations about life behind bars, it certainly showcases mundane as mundane should be.What makes it all look so convincing is some fantastic direction by De Sica to a cast of non-actors, a strategy he’s adopted earlier in The Bicycle Thieves. It makes you sympathise a lot more easily with the tears that a character sheds, laugh with them at the dark humour and feel upset about the way things finally turn out.Shoeshine wasn’t a commercial success - I doubt if neo-realistic films ever make a profit, but their social documentation is impeccable and they make a profound statement about society, its evils and its victims. Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron, another neo-realistic masterpiece for example, wasn’t a box-office hit. But like all other films in its genre, it attained cult status over the years.The film, however did win the first ever Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film and went on to inspire many reforms in the way post-war Italy treated its children.That’s a reason enough to celebrate this film.

Yes people, Shootout at Lokhandwala is a complete bukwass philum. I really feel sorry for all those who expected this gangster rap to be rocking, but yaar if you mix 5 star class pasta with roadside vada paav you would only end up with beswadi khichadi.And that’s exactly what SAL is, neither a classy commercial film nor a gut-retching reality flick. All you do the entire 2 hours 15 minutes is wait for this torture to get over because you can't even afford to walk off after shelling out 250 Rupees behind this miserable effort.But not to worry too much, if you have already bought the tickets and have yet to see it, here are some noteworthy aspects (and thank God for that).Now moving on to my bitchy side, here are just some of points (and a few advices) that make this film a thakela watch.As you can see from the above, I could go on and on and on but I won’t.Instead I shall leave you with the most apt one-liner exhaled by some dude, once the credit titles were up - ""Gupta, Kya F***all Picture Hai"".

If there was anything else it was too loud to register. ,"I have noticed, these days, when the decibel level of a film goes beyond a certain level, I tune off. There you go, that's my disclaimer. I tune off so well, that I have to resist myself from a quick nap. Despite this, Shootout at Wadala managed to give me a headache by the end of the film. Or maybe it was because of my attempt at controlling my sleep. Eitherway, Shootout at Wadala is your regular gangwar film where everyone wants to kill everyone else. There is one slight difference in that it tries to talk about the ineptness of the system that creates gangsters out of good people. But the message is too little compared to what you have to sit through in terms of pure noise. Not that it is something very new, in any case.The actors do infuse life into the story that runs on for too long. But, the problem with a film that is so intense in terms of how quickly all the characters get angry, doesn't require too much variety from the actors. But, within what is required of them, they do well. Not that there aren't light moments in the film, but they cater to the kind of people who find a good laugh in abusive language just because it is abusive. The rest of the dialogue is way to filmy with all the mythological, religious and philosophical references. The romantic track, though important to the film is given too much of a step-sisterly treatment.In fact, it looks like more time and energy has been spent on 'item numbers' who appear abrupt despite the fact that they are immediately followed by a horny Manya Surve (John Abraham) at Vidya's (Kangna Ranaut) door. Even so, given my aversion to gore and action for the sake of it, if you do enjoy such fight sequences, you might find Shootout at Wadala worth a watch. Like Shootout at Lokhandwala, this one too has its share of creatively killing people. Ultimately, Shootout at Wadala seems to be the kind of film that will be enjoyed by people who like this mix of moderately gory action, toilet humor and aggressive romance.

Fortunately, it is another well-made dark comedy. Shor in the city is well-shot and has good performances. It also has a few well-developed, interesting characters. Yet, the plot gives a very ""been there, seen that"" feel.","""Cute"" is my first reaction to Shor in the city. Of course, not in the mush-mush kind-of way. It is after all, a dark comedy set deep in the grim, gritty recesses of a fractured city that we all make. But, a nag starts as soon as the main characters are introduced.As I enjoyed how well Shor in the city is shot and admired every performance, I was trying to point my finger at what was bothering me, what was keeping this from being a complete fun experience? When I read, ""Each incident is inspired by a newspaper story"" in the end credits, I realized the familiarity of the stories is what was bothering me. Not that I knew of the stories before hand, but this is how this new genre of ""dark comedy/pulp"" is beginning to settle in Hindi cinema. You have your mix of rugged texture, close-ups, relatively non-standard camera angles. Even story wise, you have a regular dose of hotch-potch of 4-5 stories with interesting characters. Their paths collide. And along the way, you make comments on the system we form, the society we make. In the social commentary department, Shor in the city chooses bribery, a sarcastic look at religion, stronghold of underworld crime, the hierarchy that a gun-holder can create, frustration of the honest man in this big, bad world. It uses a small-time crook who gets interested in the books he pirates to define both the futility, superficiality and yet the charm of the escape that a ""philosophical"" world creates. Oh yeah, and it also exposes our fake love for our national passion - cricket. The candid, uninhibited smooching and making out scenes announce the new-age cinema's emphatic decision to be bold and also shows how liberal the SMS/BPO center generation is. Given that none of these things are new to us, the performances make this film a watchable experience. Certainly, there are smart-ass dialogues but from Tusshar Kapoor to Pitobhash to Amit Mistry - each actor makes his character just perfect. Yeah, it is different from your mainstream films but within its genre it's ""more of the same"". In fact, it's one of those films in which no climax will surprise you - be it characters who die or the ones that survive. Fortunately, you mildly care for some of the characters and interested in what happens to them.

The willingness to experiment with plot is marred by the inexplicable need to bollywoodize the details.,"How ironic. A movie that makes a comment on the prevalent systems in the Hindi film industry gives us a complete dose of slapstick, clichés, glaring loopholes, songs that don't belong and the works. And this is despite making a few smart and snide remarks. It talks indirectly about audience's taste in films being dictated by the star of the day. About how a non-actor can reign ""Bollywood"". It talks about the way things work in the industry. That it takes a lot of struggle to make it big. That goodness or ingenuity is not necessarily awarded. But then there are unbelievable events like the entire population of a rundown building lends miraculous support to the protagonist. Or the lead lady who's a successful actress has no say in decisions regarding her personal life. Are these formula sub-plots a comment on commercial cinema or are they gaps in the script - we'll never know. Or is ""bollywood"" their excuse for making one patchy film? And despite these flaws there are some very interesting plot twists in the film. The kind that put the characters in dilemmas and conflicts that require extreme steps to be resolved. Shekhar (Akshaye Khanna) reaches a point where a decision that is pretty much out of his control is forced upon him. When he's not ready. A decision that pretty much makes it 'love of his life' vs. 'his career'. Manasi (Amrita Rao) faces two extreme types of people in her life. People who want to take every advantage of her affluent position and people who can't bare the thought of doing that. She is a good girl and yet she makes an extremely selfish move. All facets of the film industry which might also reflect on any other community are touched upon. From the naturally malicious to the converted cruel people. And then there are well-meaning people who try to play mentor but first take care of themselves. Such is life. And Short Kut captures it well. The lead actors do a decent job of portraying their characters too. Akshaye Khanna comes across as the righteous and egoistic, male chauvinist that Shekhar is. So far I've seen Amrita Rao play non-glam roles. Seeing her skimpy clothes feels like seeing a child grow into a woman. Two old men lech at her offended me. But she came across as someone who can take care of herself. Exactly like Manasi. Arshad Warsi is the exact amount of annoying in his portrayal as the shallow, uncouth [email protected][email protected]&*. I could have easily done without the parts where he gets too loud to be tolerable. Which reminds me of the unique sense of humor one needs to see Chunkey Pandey cast as an acting Guru! The rest of the side characters are best left alone. They are too garish and caricatured to be funny. They in fact make the film seem much longer than it actually is. Also the film drags quite a bit. Had the slapstick and drama been left out it would have been very good riddance to bad rubbish. And it would have saved a lot of stock, money, and time of both the makers and the audience. Imagine the man-hours that will be spent in watching all the extra ugly frills. For some the best short cut would be to skip the film. For others who care for interesting conflicts and characters might want to give it a shot. But a forward button might come in handy when the not-so-interesting parts come. They do come a bit too often.

What? Did I hear 'whatever'? Pretty much.,"Shortcut Romeo is desperate to be stylish, desperate to have a story, desperate to fill in all the elements considered to constitute a Hindi thriller - love, drama, action, betrayal. Only thing missing seems to comedy, thank goodness for some mercies. Yet, you have to give them some leeway for trying, even if they tried way too hard. You have a blackmailer (Neil Nitin Mukesh) taking advantage of having caught a rich woman (Ameesha Patel) red-handed. But this lady ain't going to take it lying down and gives him a good fight at being nasty. Interestingly, both supposedly have shades of good in them too. The schemes and counter-schemes they design are too elaborate and lie too obviously at the mercy of coincidences, which actually happen. Not to mention, they are a tad predictable too. The characters are either nasty or uninteresting for you to invest in them. That leaves the dialogue in the writing department to pull you in. Shortcut Romeo doesn't manage to take you in with any good lines either.The performances too are as dull as one would expect from Ameesha Patel or Neil Nitin Mukesh. However, the latter does try hard to infuse life into his lines and to bring out the mean streak in his character. Puja Gupta too tries her best to be sensuous and simple, but that ultimately amounts to a one-expression deal. The rest of the supporting cast is outright bad with their dialogue delivery and body language. Even so, it does feel like the makers give Shortcut Romeo its best shot. It doesn't feel like they take the audience for granted. Its just that the ability of the writer/director to engage us is limited.

Within a few minutes, usually about one-fourth the length of a feature film, it is made to create a world, develop characters, present and resolve a conflict and see through the beginning, middle and end. Each of the five films that makes Shorts, is unique in the way it goes about its business. However, there are things that you might not understand and make you feel that you needed more time with the film. There are other times when the abstract treatment could get annoying. In either case, it is still an effort that definitely needs encouragement.There are a few things that are absolutely great across the board. Performances are just outstanding in each of the films. Even if its tempting to name a few of the known faces, It would be unfair to just point those out as great acts. They are very rooted and set in real life, except for maybe the second film, The Epilogue which needs histrionics because of the abstract treatment it carries.Similarly each of the films also creates a universe best fitted for its concept/theme. The ambiance is pitch perfect and most interestingly, even though each one is different from the other, it is easy enough to move from one to the other without feeling uprooted from the previous one. Dialogue is, in general, sparse, except for Audacity which needs the chaos that it generates. I think that is the beauty of dialogue writing, you need to know when not to have characters speak. It gives so much more room for the rest of the crew from the director and actors to the camera and music departments. Most enticing of them all are the concepts picked by each writer/director and the combination that makes for the feature length film. Let's take a brief look at each one. For a detailed look, you have watch the film, of course.Sujata by Shlok Sharma
A girl is abused by her cousin from her childhood till present time where she's a grown woman. Sujata does get you rooting for its protagonist even though you barely know her. Unfortunately, that also becomes its handicap. To continue feeling her angst and being with her through her struggle, you are not offered much of a backstory. How justified is her anger towards the cousin? Do you endorse all her actions? While I am all for unanswered questions in films, this one made me uncomfortable. The Epilogue by Siddharth Gupt
Fear. How do you deal with it? Maybe, the only way to face fear, is to ignore it. After all, it is like an beautiful woman who throws tantrum to get your attention. And  maybe there is only one way to deal with her. Or maybe it is just a claustrophobic relationship story that needs to get its closure.  That is the beauty of The Epilogue, it is open to interpretation.Audacity by Anirban Roy
The mind of a teenager. An already confused one. And then it has to face the perplexing and thus, frustrating double standards of parents. These standards or lack thereof do not allow the adults to take responsibility of their contribution to their child's misbehaviour. This child then decides to teach them a lesson. Is the child right in behaving so? Are the parents doing the right thing? This Bengali (with English subtitles) short, Audacity doesn't take sides and tells us that just maybe everyone is responsible in the said situation and you would only go around in circles if you played the blame game.Mehfuz by Rohit Pandey
Mehfuz is more to me about the mood it creates with its camera work and sound design than about what it is trying to say. With such films, you do not go about looking for meaning or deeper meaning. Its morbid and looks at morbidity in the eye. It goes on to confirm, even a cold graveyard worker cannot really get used to death.Shor by Neeraj Ghaywan
Nothing like the sounds of Mumbai to make a movie called Shor. That it also points at the internal chaos each one of us faces, is of course, of larger significance. Most of our struggle is a lot about the one major relationship in our life and how dissatisfactory it is. It has never stopped amazing me that, the most important relationship of our life is the one we mistreat the most. And yet, life offers us a chance once in a while to set things right. Shor too creates just the right tone for what it has to say.Each of the films has something going for it and takes a very serious look at one aspect of life or the other. Which brings me to the one question I've had about short films in general. Why do they have to be so serious? Does comedy need a bigger canvas? Even so, you cannot deny that this ""different"" experience is a welcome change. In the last 5-7 years, only every second or third year, have we had one feature length film which is only a collection of short films. It is really heartening to see two such films this year. I imagine a time, hopefully not to far away, when not only such films will be the norm, but also when a feature film will be preceded or followed by a short film which will be worth coming early or waiting for. More power to the brave souls who  have taken the first step towards making this happen.

Middle-class setting that reminds you of films from the 70s? yepp!! 
Great performances? yeppp!!! 
Engaging film? No :(","For a movie that has so many departments working well individually, Shubh Mangal Saavdhan is ultimately underwhelming. With Ayushman Khurana and Bhumi Pednekar at the helm of affairs, there is little doubt with the acting department even before the movie begins. In some sense, it is a given that the topic will be interesting given this cast for that's how they seem to pick their scripts. The reminiscence of the 70s style of narration – a story from a small snippet of a middle-class family is always endearing. That makes Shubh Mangal Saavdhan one of those times when the “how” is as good as the “what” and yet it doesn't work because they aren't in sync.At first, the film might come across as a strong statement on feminism. While the film is that it is much, much more about gender roles, even more than it is about the taboo subject of erectile dysfunction. Gender roles and associated pressures of “being a man” and “lady-like” are even directly addressed without spoon-feeding or preaching. There are other endearing behavioral observations. Such as, the woman wanting excitement before the wedding, especially in an arranged marriage. Despite being rather common in real life, this theme has been only fleetingly touched upon in movies off and on. Here it gets some space to bloom. Unfortunately, it doesn't feel wholesome. Another huge part of the film is the exaggerated involvement of the family. The satire is amusing for a bit but the hyperbole gets tiring in a bit. I am always in awe when the writers go over-the-top but the actors don't. While Brijendra Kala seems repetitive. Seema Pahwa makes me want me to see more and more of her, with every film, even if it is similar kind of roles. Similarly, Pednekar is getting slightly repetitive while Ayushmann Khurana brings more nuance with every film. Some of this might have to do with how the film is written and the characters these two play. The interactions between the lead pair seem out of sync. Before any chemistry is established they are shown alternating between being loving to and upset with each other. Their interaction seems random. Fortunately it can be enjoyed one scene at a time. The brilliant actors that they are, they manage to create a few moments too. There is one scene that will stick with me for a long, long time. In one short situation which is very awkward for both characters, you see how much respect they have for each other and how much they are willing to do for the other too. Bhumi Pednekar might be falling into a bracket – of a middle class woman who speaks her mind, while stays kind and caring. You could say the same thing about Ayushman Khurana, but I am happy with the small variety he brings within the romance genre. From the totally confident man in Nautanki Saala who draws the woman he loves close to him to this diffident, hesitant, gentle man. It is disheartening that these moments aren't spread through the film's writing. It is disheartening that the writing feels disjointed as if it was written over years and the writers lost objectivity. It is disheartening that the next time the topic and these behavioral observations are taken up in a film, they will seem like a repeat. In some sense, we have lost the “freshness” of this topic within a romantic relationship to “done before” in a sub-optimal way.

Unfortunately, not entirely because of the film.","Is marriage dying? No, not yours or a marriage around you. Marriage - as a concept, is it dying? That's the question Shudh Desi Romance is trying to get a hold of. You'd think it is as interesting as the trailers and songs of the film promised. Alas, that doesn't work out. 15-20 minutes into the film and you know the plot is falling flat. I've warmed up to the idea of confused / listless / loser lead characters since I started seeing poetry in their tragedy. So, I try to find that in Raghuram Sitaram (Sushant Singh Rajput). That made me want to love him. Also, Rajput plays the youngster with earnestness. His confusion though boyish, comes across as a very ""man""-like thing to do. Yes, yes, stereotyping and all. But, I can imagine many women going ""these men!"" if they look at him from the ""he can't express himself"" angle. He does have his charm, yet it is very difficult to see why these vibrant, confidently aggressive women - two not one - have fallen for him. What's that they say about love, again? Let's say blind, it is. So, two blind women and a loser. Even if I were told that before watching the film, so strong is my faith in Jaideep Sahni that I'd still look forward to it. And he doesn't disappoint - well, at least not in the dialogue. The lines are earthy, snappy, and delivered well. In fact, they are the only things that keep the film going. And Rishi Kapoor, of course - thank goodness for him! After all, there's only so much that can keep you interested if events get repetitive. And that is where I had a hard time accepting that it is Jaideep Sahni's work. True, there is a pattern to every person's behavior, especially when it comes to their love life. But, the repetition here isn't interesting enough to sail you through 2+ hours. It's almost as if the makers realised it was getting boring when they have the characters break the fourth wall to explain their motives to us. For one, their characters weren't that deeply sketched for us to have too many questions about their motivation. And then, there are some things that are better left unsaid. Also, with the realistic treatment that the film gets from its art director, it is a rude intrusion. Not that B-town neighbours accepting a young couple in a live-in relationship is very real. But, then that you accept as a realism that the makers wish for or even foresee. It helps that Parineeti Chopra and Vaani Kapoor make Gayatri and Tara seem very comfortable with who they are. Except when it comes to being intimate with the guy they are in love with. I must admit here, that the awkard first kiss is charming in its own way. But, it is difficult to believe that the couple who is so comfortable when they sing are so out of sorts when they aren't singing about their love life. After comments on varying topics from US' involvement in wars world-wide to safety of women in India, all it boils down to is the lyrics of one of the songs - 'chanchal mann, ati random...' (Flitting mind/heart, very random) - Shudh Desi Romance - with all its zeal to be pertinent, comes across as rather random.

374,1074,1074,1074,1074,Shuruaat Ka Interval,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/shuruaat-ka-interval-review/,,,,2.4,"An anthology of eights shorts made under an initiative by Humaara Movie and PVR, Shuruaat Ka Interval showcases the work of eight brave filmmakers who’ve made the films that they wanted to make, without the pressure of the dreaded return on investment. That makes the film one of the most honest big screen experiences in recent times.","The one thought that subconsciously remains with you through all of the eight short films in Shuruaat Ka Interval, and which manifests itself into the biggest takeaway from the experience as a whole, is the fact that none of the films were made under the burden of commercial expectations. Each of the filmmakers made the film that they wanted to make. Some of them feel a little raw, yes, and some of them seemed to exist more in minds of the director than as an engaging experience for an audience who doesn’t know what is in the filmmaker’s mind. Yet, all eight films are perhaps the most honest pieces of filmmaking that you can expect from Indian filmmakers this year. Themed around the word ‘interval’, each filmmaker interpreted it in their own way, and each of them has come up with starkly different interpretations of the theme.My personal favourite from the anthology was Final Interval, directed by Aarti Bagdi, which is about a person who is the pillar of a family. Despite the film’s rather weak performances, it had a very interesting multi-threaded narrative that all came together for a gut-wrenching finish. Another beautiful, somber experience was The Gatekeeper, directed by Atanu Mukherjee. Largely a single character film about a person who mans a railway crossing, the film is beautifully shot, and moves you with the sheer melancholy of the protagonist’s life, but also makes you wonder about what it would take to live years and years of the kind of life the gatekeeper lives.Yet another haunting single character piece is Shishir Jha’s August, which is basically a question on what constitutes right and wrong. Treated in black-and-white, the film is staid and decently performed, but it often seemed like it deserved a little more exposition, though that is a choice that one can’t fault with.A close second favourite for me was Ayan, directed by Amrit Raj Gupta. Perhaps the best acted film amongst the lot, the film takes us backstage at a theatrical performance of Ramayan, where the man playing Ram disappears, leaving the remaining actors and director in the lurch. Hilarious and spontaneous, with rat-a-tat dialogue delivery and some really fine acting, Ayan is genuine fun. Also, being one of only two films from the anthology that can be slotted as true comedies, this one is likely to be the most memorable film of the lot.The other comedy, Interval 3D by Palash Vaswani, has an interesting premise. In the middle of a show of a B-grade horror film, a character from the film gets thrown out from the film and enters the real world, where he meets the audience. This highly intriguing premise, though, is let down by some weak attempts at comedy. Also, the film has been colour-graded far too much – possibly to give it the unreal feel that the plot demands; but it seems far too inorganic, for want of a better word.Krishan Hooda’s The Last Audition is more dark comedy than anything else, but it masks the tragedy that the life of a struggling actor in Bombay is. People have only heard about ‘struggling actors’, but if you visit Bombay and silently observe the thousands of auditions that take place on any given day here, you realize that it is perhaps the most heart-breaking life a person can lead. Beautifully acted by the protagonist, The Last Audition is the most rooted film of the lot.The only film from the set that I found a tad too indulgent in terms of the narrative was Ankit Tripathi’s No Exit. The film has an interesting idea at its core – that of memories being the bane of one’s existence – but it follows a jagged structure that just doesn’t work for the kind of film it aspires to be. It was the one film of the lot that did absolutely nothing for me.Perhaps the most daring, layered and assured film from the anthology is Rukshana Tabassum’s Bubbles and Stars. Confusing and beautiful in equal measure, it is – to use a word from the film itself – about ‘randomness’. In the interval of a play, the characters (not the actors,) live a little life of their own. Steady black-and-white images that gel well with the interaction between the two zany characters, the film strangely reminded me of a highly sanitized, 50s version of Q’s Tasher Desh – though this is probably a highly personal feeling. The film will probably need multiple viewings to thoroughly absorb, but it quite simply was the most intriguing film of the lot.Shuruaat Ka Interval is an inspiration for aspiring filmmakers, and it is a refreshing change for an audience that hasn’t been served genuinely honest cinema in what seems like decades. Hopefully, the film will usher in a trend of more theatrical releases for shorts, which can only mean good things for Indian cinema.Note: The ratings given are for the entire experience of the eight short films as an anthology, and will obviously not accurately convey rating of each individual film.

375,1075,1075,1075,1075,Siddhant,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/siddhant-2015-review/,,,,2.4,A good concept seems unresolved – owing to inept writing and direction.,"A Physics graduate by accident, I always tried my best to evade Math (Geometry in particular). Memorising mathematical concepts surpassed the significance of understanding them, just like Vivek Wagh’s debut feature. Remember a common, exam-time state – wherein you start writing an answer quite excitedly but forget it in between or entirely? Something similar happens with Siddhant as it takes the easy way out. It indeed displays what it is capable of or at least the intensity of the underlying subject in its opening minutes. It doesn’t advance however and instead fumbles in reaching a conclusion.A Math super-enthusiast, Vikram Gokhale essays an idealistic grandfather. Almost all characters he plays has a shade of a principled, idealistic person. More often than not, you would find him enforcing his principles or dreams on someone This time around, he wants his grandson to become one of the greatest mathematicians in the world. Every object in this world has some sort of geometric connection, he conveys relentlessly. Math also happens to be his only ray of hope, except for the regular dose of Rajinikanth films.Now that his character is established and its possible consequences are anticipated, little is left to be unravelled, right? Well; the film still manages to surprise you, despite being predictably flawed for the most part. Gokhale’s indulgence with Mathematics, for that matter, is so intense that his hatred or liking for other subjects remains unspecified. Seemingly trivial, it actually results in a facile drama you barely care for.Emotions don’t seem to bother this film’s characters. But whenever they do, the story follows a little melodramatic tone; and doesn’t affect you at all. Also, you are made to face conflicts that lack depth or connect. The background sound and music do their bit to heighten the impact, but you also need visual power to balance the equation. The film lingers for an hour or so to build the situation, and it gets sluggish until you lose your interest entirely. The lone aim of dialogue appears to be instructive rather than being intriguing. Add to this poor sub-plots that divert your attention from the main theme.Even though a lot of maths goes behind the making of a film, it alone can’t help it survive.It needs the backing of strong words and direction. Several, real-life issues Siddhant depicts and solutions it chooses to offer bear no valid point. Beyond the story-driven mathematics, the film brags too much about its impact in our everyday life. There is nothing much to take away other than the subject itself. As far as the technical value is concerned, poor dubbing, unfounded camerawork or even abrupt cuts bother you from the very beginning.Archit Devadhar is on the brink of being typecast as a baffled teenager. Those who've seen Killa will agree.. He is a charming kid, whose true potential is barely evident in Siddhant. Yet, you might bump into your teenage self (especially 10th class) in his character.Notwithstanding the ingenious concept; the film not only fails to add texture to the plot, but it also forgets to grip you along. It is neither a theatrical play (it is inspired by a one-act play) nor a new-age art house film.

What is it that will liberate you from the trappings of life? An outstanding performance by Rajat Kapoor and some thoughtful yet simple background music keep you company in this extremely slow-paced film.,"An abused flat, visually so filthy that you can sense the stink it must carry. But, it must also feel like abundant luxury for someone just out of prison. The word 'prison' brings dark images to the mind even without the heavy bluish-gray tinge given to it in Siddharth - The Prisoner. These first few, short and lingering sequences bring on the mood of melancholy that doesn't go away. While soaking in these bits of Siddharth's (Rajat Kapoor's) newfound freedom you can't but help notice the background music. The keys of a typewriter tapping along to the notes of a piano. A string instrument joins later only waiting for the tinkering bell to make the rhythm complete. And the pause in the score while abrupt seems to be a part of the music itself. And soon the music becomes repetitive enough to blend with other elements and doesn't distract. A lot of being able to notice these details has to do with the minimal dialogues. There are long spans of dialogue-free movement. And yet somehow, you are tempted to think that there's something wrong with Mohan's (Sachin Nayak) righteousness. You are not surprised with how Amin (Pradip Sagar) and Aseem (Pradeep Kabra) interact and react. You are very aware of Siddharth's dilemma. And Siddharth puts to rest all my doubts about Rajat Kapoor's versatility. I was completely blown away by the way his body conveyed his thoughts. The rest, though not outstanding, don't make you doubt their behavior.Throughout the film, Hulla kept coming to mind. Maybe because the pace was similar and both had Rajat Kapoor. But somehow the brown hue and the desire to show the futility of our persistence and ambitions had the same taste and feel in both movies. Except in this one it worked for me. And yet there were phases in the movie where I could make a mental trip to the world outside that theater and come back. When that happens in a 90 minute film, it leaves a sense of incompleteness.The only way to liberate yourself is to let go. Let go of your attachments and your worldly needs. Our desires and thus our existence are in vain. The perceived 'purpose of life' is only a big sham. There is no breaking free from this tone of failure and dejection that runs heavy through the movie. As there are no conclusions to such thoughts. Then why should the movie that deals with them offer closings?

If you like your movies nicely tied up in the end, skip it for your own sake. If you like it gift-wrapped and presented in your hands, Siddharth - The Prisoner will be a 'must skip' for you. Me?

377,1077,1077,1077,1077,Sikandar,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewNotepad24 Critic Reviews 2.0/5.0,/movie/sikandar-review/,2.0/5.0,,,2.833333333,"Just like ever-so-beautiful Kashmir gets grimmer as you look deeper into the situation there, the magnificent bird's eye view of the film is marred by the unpolished details. The glowing loopholes distract from the range of interesting, socio-political underlying themes.","Paradise on earth or battlefield? Religion or Politics? Military or militants? Individualism or greater cause? Both, both, both and both. And yes Sikandar deals with all of them. Or at least tries to. Only very deft hands can do justice to the complexities these issues involve without oversimplifying it. And oversimplify this film does. That too with a lot of loopholes. Despite all of this though the film is a decent overall look at what's happening up there because, like it's said, it has its heart in the right place. Kashmir is in turmoil. We all know that. How many times do we think of the people who live there? People like you and me. What happens to the kids growing up there when they are orphaned - by our soldiers or the jehadis - collateral damage of their cause? What about the collateral damage caused to the psyche of the people living - for whom this is a way of life? How altruistic are the harbingers of peace or the messengers of God? Piyush Jha, the writer, started with a very nice and acceptable connect-the-dot game. In the overall picture, the dots, all the characters are in place - the common man, the opportunist jehadi, the calculating military, the ""impartial"" religious leaders, the crookedly ambitious politician and back to the common man. We know the dilemma or the singular aim faced by each one given his/her situation. And you are sensitized or not to their situation. But unfortunately, the links connecting them has way too many breaks, especially as the film progresses. Things are handed in too easily or are completely indigestible. Yet there are many fascinating facets. The vulnerability and pettiness of the directionless youth and how easily influenced they can be. The tyranny of the people who think they are working for a larger purpose but are doing nothing but serving their personal aspirations. And not just the politicians, all of us, including Sikandar are self-centered and self-preservation is our only goal. Guns belong to soldiers and that's where they should be. A man denies a girl her tears – does his capacity for cruelty need any more illustration? And even the glaring, on-the-face climax which leaves the future of this beautiful part of the world in the hands of the same youth - who have grown with their experiences in the last few weeks, who might have matured beyond their age due to the situation the adults around put them in. The problem is other than the overall picture, there isn't much going right in Sikandar. Apart from being full of holes, the story is pretty much predictable. Though it's difficult to say if it was the director's intention to cue the audience in. Because a lot of the acting gives away the ensuing ""twist"". Parzaan Dastur playing the lead doesn't seems to have carried on his dialogue delivery style from Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. And Black's Ayesha Kapoor just about manages to convince us of her character, Nasreen. A lot of these issues have to do with the completely off-sync dubbing. I wouldn't be surprised if I were told that the actors didn't dub for themselves. Also, R. Madhavan and Sanjay Suri barely have a role to showcase any of the skills we know they have. No doubt, this is a low-budget film and needs to be applauded for shooting in Kashmir. I liked the times when the camera moved like a soft wave. But, there surely must have been more ways to capture her beauty than to take touristy shots at dawn and dusk. I can't but resist thinking, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy saying, ""itna paisa mein itnaich milega"" (Channel V Adage, this is all you'll get for the fee you're paying me). Just didn't believe the credits when I saw them. Also, the background music was nice but some-or-the-other tune playing for the full run-time got annoying. It felt like I wanted a time-out to enjoy some Kashmir in peace.Despite all its shortcomings, I'd still want you to watch Sikandar, maybe no one needs to rush to the theater but a fair watch nevertheless. Just to bring you that one inch closer to the (quoting Madhavan's character, Rao) heaven ""man shouldn't have touched"" albeit from the safety of our homes.

378,1078,1078,1078,1078,Silver Linings Playbook,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/silver-linings-playbook-review/,,,,2.833333333,"David O. Russell’s Silver Linings Playbook is a romantic comedy with a difference. With mad, endearing characters and a wonderfully charming cast, the film is a genuine delight. It shows you that everyone has issues and that we must just deal with them; life and love will happen along the way. Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and the rest of the cast will win your hearts in this little film that’ll make for a fun watch with friends or family.","All of us are crazy, in some way or the other. As much as we’d like to pretend that we are sane while some others are not, there’s no escaping the fact that there is something inside every single person on the face of the earth that makes them weird, insane, and at times, downright neurotic. Each of us is a square block trying our best to fit into a round hole. In the charming little world created by David O. Russell in Silver Linings Playbook, a host of dysfunctional characters deal with their own little insanities in their everyday life, while coming to terms with loss, friendship and love. Far from being a typical romantic comedy, the film is a warm ride of smile-inducing moments and characters that you can’t help but fall in love with. We peek into their lives, walk with them a while and then leave them, knowing that they’ll continue with their madness; after all, we were only incidental spectators. We are immediately introduced to Pat, who has spent the last eight months in a psychiatric facility in Baltimore, for reasons explained a little later in the film. His mother signs him out and takes him back home to Philadelphia, so that he can get on with bringing normalcy back into his life. But then that is precisely what the film deals with; what exactly is ‘normal’? Pat, a married man, gets on with the task of setting things right with his life and his estranged wife, when he meets Tiffany, a recently-widowed woman who has her own issues. Together, they set about helping each other deal with the mess in their respective lives. The first, instant connect that one makes with the film is the manner in which the characters speak to each other; it seems real, because in real life, rarely do people talk in full sentences when in conversation. We often cut each other off, we often speak simultaneously and we almost often talk more than we listen. The writing, direction and the performances work so beautifully together to achieve this effect of the characters conversing how people do in real life. Also, every character has their own little lunacy that finds resonance within you on some level. So there’s Pat’s obsessive-compulsive father who is superstitious about the presence or absence of objects and people while watching a football game. Then there’s his mate from the psychiatric hospital who can only talk about his hair; and so many others, each of whom you can’t help but adore.What I really liked about the film is the fact that you always know where it is going, but that doesn’t stop the film from surprising you throughout. It thrives on the simple principle that the journey matters more than the destination; how you get to the end matters more than the end itself. So, even if the story isn’t novel in any way, the screenplay is tinged with humour in everyday lines and events, with the odd outlandish situation that will make you smile wide.  My only real problems with the film were largely technical – minor directorial oversights like some suspect choice of shot framing, particularly in long dialogue scenes, as well as frequent axis jumps. Axis jumps are fine as long as they don’t ruin the illusion of continuity, but they often do so in this film. Also, I often got the feeling that a number of the dialogues and scenes were far longer, but were cut short – a call taken at the edit stage, I suspect.   The plethora of nominations and wins that the cast of the film has garnered comes as no surprise; every single one of them is outstanding. Bradley Cooper has always had a likeable, charming presence on screen. But his turn as Pat comes as a huge surprise. He manages to capture every little beat of his character’s quirks so beautifully that it blows you away. The gorgeous Jennifer Lawrence, best known for her role as Katniss Evergreen in The Hunger Games, manages to spring a wonderful performance as Tiffany. Tiffany is, if possible, an even crazier character than Pat, and Lawrence completely wins your heart with her performance. I didn’t know that she had it in her to turn out such a mature performance at such a young age. I was glad to see one of my favourite actors, Robert De Niro, back in form after such a long time. After a slew of indifferent characters that he has played lately, he finally sinks his teeth into the heartwarming character of Pat’s father. Jacki Weaver plays Pat’s mother; she expresses more with her eyes than through her words, and she does a wonderful job as well. One of my other favourite actors, our very own Anupam Kher, plays Pat’s psychiatrist in the film. He has a small role, but is a joy to watch. Also, what a relief to finally not have an Indian actor speak with a silly accent in a Hollywood film. No one buys an old-fashioned romantic comedy anymore, because both, the romance and the comedy, are invariably cranked up beyond necessary. Silver Linings Playbook is a new age romantic comedy, one where the romance and comedy are far more real and identifiable. It is a film with heart as well as a sense of humour, and both of them are bound to charm you. Watch the film; there is a good chance that you’ll be smiling throughout, and that you’ll leave the cinema smiling.

If only, the plot didn't accelerate to being outland-ish mid-way. ","An Indian middle-class household, only this time it is in American suburbia. That itself is a background relatively sparingly used in Indian films. The lead character, Ms. Patel (Kangna Ranaut) lands herself in more and more unbelievable situations. Yet, you want to shrug it off as the story of one of those odd, madcap people that you encounter in real life too. The craziness makes the plot fall in Hrishikeh Mukherjee, “real people in unreal situations” territory too. But, some time in the last 45 minutes it crosses a line, that makes you dislike the person that the lead lady is. Simran is no “coming of age” or “seeking / finding redemption” story. It is the story of an unapologetic, even stupid, character. But, as an after-thought, I realised that it is only a slight, figurative exaggeration of some of the people we know.  Here I am pointing to those people we know who have very little financial prudence; who know they are digging themselves a deeper hole with every credit card swipe, but are lured by their supposed need for something out-of-reach – a house, a car, branded clothes, “better” lifestyle. This is why I absolutely loved the climax. It was so pleasantly unexpected, yet it stayed believable – given both the texture of the film and the similarity to some real-life people I know. The acceleration flows well from one incident to another in our protagonist's life. All aspects of Ms. Patel's life are intertwined – her job, her love-life, her aspirations, her relationship with her parents. It would have been so easy to make these things episodic, each episode exposing an aspect of her personality.  Owing to the non-standard, holistic approach, it doesn't feel like the scenes were built to prove a certain point about the character but you were seeing her life as it happens. Until it becomes a bit much to digest. A little into the second half, I had that sinking feeling that the movie is losing its plot. But, since the film stays grounded without overt Americanisation or glamorisation and Kangna Ranaut's is restrained and real, you don't want to give up. Here, the American setting was not really necessary for the script, but the film stays matter-of-factly about it. It just is. Even the sequences in Las Vegas or the only scenes in which Ranaut is well-made-up and well-dressed are rather glitz-free. Surprisingly, the scenes with sex seemed gratuitous and thus, extraneous to the film. I am always thrown off by Kangna Ranaut's accent. So, I easily lost track of whether or not she maintained her Gujarati accent through and through. However, that matters little since she is otherwise doing a good job of making an unbelievably idiot of a character, seem possible. Simran has an obscure layer of gender bias that's intriguing. Under the overt lines by Mr. Patel, the lead character's father, “a girl should get married”, “a daughter is property that is passed on from father to husband” was this hidden desire for a son. The sole child of this middle-class, Indian-American household, a girl has an ambiguously male-sounding name. This divorced daughter is given one of two contradictory choices – to get married as a girl ought to be or to help support household expenses as a boy ought to do. Be a girl and get out of the house or stay in the house and do what is expected of a boy. This gender bias is not satirical or incidental, it feels like a slice-of-every-girl's life.  This ought to have created sympathy. However, the various facets of Kangna Ranaut's character push you to dislike her. The commentary on financial mismangement and general irresponsibility of the millenials seem exaggerated and  yet, ring true. The struggle of Indian parents and children in America to be both American and Indian at the same time isn't new. But put together, they make the film a rich experience that cannot be slotted into one genre. My heart leaped with joy at the climax. If only, the 20-30 minutes in the second half didn't distance you from the film.

Eva Green is a treat as always, but even she can't get this film even close to the first one.","If you're keen on watching Sin City: A Dame To Kill For, there's a good chance you're a fan of Robert Rodriguez's first Sin City, both of which are based on graphic novels by Frank Miller. (Rodriguez shares director credit with Miller because of how he faithfully recreates images from the graphic novels.)The first one went down as a cult film. It was disruptive, entertaining, and it had those gorgeous high-contrast, black-and-white frames that made it a visual treat. Visually, A Dame To Kill For follows the first. It also still is pulpy and intriguing, but it just doesn't have the same taut writing and execution that made Sin City so much fun. On the contrary, it seems like this one is trying too hard.It picks up characters and some threads of story from the first film, adds some new characters into the fray, and follows a similar parallel narrative structure as we see the deteriorating morality and abject disregard for law-and-order that we're quite familiar with in the fictional Basin City, popularly called Sin City, because, you know, that name suits it and its residents better.That's just a sanitized way of describing the film, of course - it is all about money, power, sex and crime. (Though you won't get much of number 3 on that list if you watch it on the big screen, thanks to our censor board. There are some pretty blatant cuts, usually accompanied by groans from what seems to be a rather deprived urban audience.)The most welcome addition to that cast and storyline is Eva Green, who plays a moral-less, cold-hearted schemer who possesses an uncanny power over men, who she uses and tramples over as and when it suits her. Hence the tag line of the film. Green seems to have made a habit out of being the best thing about the sequels she stars in (remember 300: Rise of an Empire?), but she doesn't quite give this film the sting that it deserved.Though the film is briskly paced, it seems longer than its 100-minute run time because most of the film is narrated by voice-overs of the characters - which pretty much outline the what, when and why of things through philosophical-sounding rants attempting to pass off as story-telling. You want the film to grab at your gut, that's what you expect from Sin City. But it ends up being feeble. Part of the reason could be the fact that cinema audiences have changed since the first film came out, and there is a lot more exposure and understanding of blurring moral lines today. So obviously, unless this film significantly upped its game in the 'let's shake things up a bit' department, it wouldn't nearly have the same kind of impact as one would have hoped.The other additions to the cast - Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Josh Brolin - make hay while the darkness shines, but you somehow end up feeling that they were just going through the motions; as does Robert Rodriguez, to be honest. It still is good fun watching an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke as Marv pounding guys just for the heck of it, or the ladies of Old Town being the deadly rear guard that they revel in being, but the film still just doesn't ever make you feel like you're witnessing something spectacular. As a companion piece to the first, it would make for a fair lazy weekend DVD watch, but that's about it. Besides, you want to watch this film uncut, because let's face it - Sin City isn't quite the same without the sex.I'm a big fan of Robert Rodriguez, mainly because of his story - the way he chased his passion for cinema despite having next to nothing, and ended up being an A-list Hollywood director. (For cinephiles, his book 'Rebel Without A Crew' is a must read.) Despite having an up-and-down filmography, he always seemed like someone who wanted to push the envelope. His last few films, though, haven't quite seemed that way. Let's hope he gets his act together soon, hopefully in a far more thrilling Sin City 3, in case he plans to make it.

Well, at least for me. ","From one film that wants you to think even after you are out of the theater into another that begs you to not even try – such is the scene at the theaters this week. I take solace in the fact that films in the Singh is Bliing genre have started making an attempt at some sort of a story. That they end up doing a blotchy job is another matter. People can't be expected to be good at everything. If they are so good at using saturated color and saturated sound too, they slip in the writing department. Is that such a crime?For some of us, yes. And we shall stick to it, even if the film is in the Akshay Kumar genre. Sure, the theater was in splits a lot of the time. It also sounded like they were laughing with the film, that had created that humor intentionally even. But, people peeing at each other or a dog dressed as a lion, never made me laugh as a child, don't make me laugh now. Some of the humor is creative, but still not funny.Other than that it is the usual loud fest and plastic performances with Akshay Kumar trying his best to infuse some life into the film. Lara Dutta does get a smile or two out but the randomness of the character is quite distracting. Of course, it can be argued that random equals funny. Amy Jackson is expectedly insufferable. The film tries to make its point about women empowerment and also throws in a bit on religious tolerance in the end. But, how can you take any of it seriously when empowerment is made equal to become protector from protect-ee, as if there is no in-between?Yes Meeta, do not go about over-intellectualizing what is not meant to be. Let go. Okay, at least tell me this – Singh didn't seem very bling, why name him so?

As novel as that one gets, only louder when we thought it wasn't possible. ","Doesn't it actually feel like every actor needs to have an action film in which he/she is the honest and/or do-gooder fighting against the corrupt system? Actually, it is more specific than that. It is like every actor should have a film like this with Prakash Raj as the villain. So, Singh Saab The Great adds Sunny Deol's name to the list. As expected, it is loud and gets louder by the minute. And there are entire 150 of those, no less. I must say the slight twist in the concept is interesting but they give up on it even before the audience begins to appreciate it. Other than that though, it is as run-of-the-mill and tedious as it gets. The action choreographer tries to shock every once in a while by going a little over the top. But, you end up being just slightly amused rather than awed with those gimmicks. Even with these interesting deviations in terms of writing, the emotions never engage. It has to be as much due to how exposed we are to this theme as it is to the writing as it is to the performances. Over-written dialogue delivered by Sunny Deol in a manner that we are so used to over decades. For the rest you have Prakash Raj whose performance could've had an impact had it not been the, goodness knows how many, 15th time we've seen it.What I found absolutely ridiculous was the sudden introduction of a communal tone. It comes out of the blue and way too late in the scheme of things. It thus ends up sounding like an afterthought. Not that way too much thought has been put in the plot, anyway.And yet, isn't this what we knew to expect? The Deols - they seem to have a world of their own. That world has either the three of them in lead roles, else in cameos with one of them as a lead. This world has an audience of its own that enjoys cars lifted and turned around single-handedly by the famous two-and-a-half-kilo hand. This world is impervious to the likes and dislikes of outsiders. I watch because, well I like giving every movie a chance. Or maybe masochism just comes easily to me.

It tries to make a couple of points but they are lost in the ""coolness"" that the film wants to be.","Singham desperately wants to highlight the power of numbers. Especially when the number is actual people who are frustrated with the system they have become a part of. Singham says, if we believe in this power nothing is unachievable. Well, this is not the first story that wants us to believe, nothing is beyond a ""united"" people - be it media, police or the common man. I'm not going to complain about how simple Singham's solutions are or how idealistic too. The problem is, the wagon it uses to make its point. It is action comedy. It is cool inside the theater and forgotten outside. To top it off, all the ""smart action"" parts, you've already seen in the trailers.Singham would have worked a little better if they had a little more action than the one we had already seen because I remember being in complete awe of the muscular Ajay Devgn running in slo-mo, getting off a swinging jeep. It was creative and held my attention. The entire feature though, is held together by a very slow set-up, choppy flow and unbelievable character transformations to make the climax. It is weird to assess a particular sequence or character when you like the concept of what's playing itself out but you are laughing at the far-fetched actions and reactions. I guess it's because you just wish some of the things happening were true. Other than these things though, there were a few immensely likeable elements in Singham. One is ofcourse, Ajay Devgn. He plays the quite-in-words, loud-with-action Singham with a lot of energy. Prakash Raj plays the arrogant, ""egoistical"" Jaykant Shikre with a good dose of humor. The rest of the cast supports these two in whatever needs to be done to get the film through its 140 minute run-time.These characters, the lines given to them, the set-up they find themselves in all say, ""we are so cool that you can laugh at us, see if we care."" They play childish pranks with each other, they mock and mimic each other, they bring in popular film references in regular conversation. These are the things that make Singham a little more than a regular good cop-bad goon drama. The good is good and the bad is bad, and it more or less, remains so. The hero is so good, and the villain is so bad that you don't believe either of them but you still want to know how the good is going to get out of the soup that the evil has created. Anyway, maybe the gray shade had no business in films like this. Who wants the ""in-between"" when a corrupt politician needs to be beaten up?Singham does represent the frustration our nation is going through. We are desperate. We want solutions to our corrupt government. We are so darn aggravated that we want to suspend our disbelief and trust that if we all came together we can crack the long-overdue whip at the system. So, we cheer Singham as he goes about his job of being honest and brave. But Rohit Shetty doesn't want us to forget it's a film. He makes sure with his ""out-takes"" in the end credits. All this coolness is fake; it's for films. In real life, you can't do better than online petitions and candle light vigils.

","It is always fun to watch branded films like Singham Returns, whether or not you like the film ultimately. The audience is there to enjoy and I always enjoy their enthusiasm. This once, though there was an additional pleasure. First fifteen minutes into the film, and you know there is a serious attempt at developing a plot. Another half an hour or so in, when you hear one or two people clap and cheer and the rest of the audience joins in you realise that the viewers have been uncharacteristically quiet after the initial zeal. They were hooked to what was happening on screen. Unfortunately, this doesn't last through the film. There are dips, especially in the second half and the climax is a simple bummer.Yet, Singham Returns started with an impact. In fact, it was a pleasant surprise to see subtlety in this form of cinema. There's a remark on an entire generation being responsible for the ""anything goes"" attitude of the current generation, especially with regard to corruption. Then, the ""vote-buying"" scene with the backdrop of a city skyline was a nice touch (even if executed tackily). And a few more alond similar lines.The dialogue writing, especially in the first half is strikingly good. Even if some of it does get ""filmy"", a lot of it is delivered smoothly to appreciate both the dialogue delivery and the dialogue itself. At most times they are unexpectedly contextual, and at times they are even insightful/profound. But, of course, it loses steam in the second half. The writer's passion for showing the hard-working, dutiful facet of the Mumbai police shines through. It's almost as if he takes the offense personally, when people try to bribe a policeman on the street. Not a single policeman is corrupt and they are all up in arms to do the right thing, even if it were at the risk of losing their beloved job. It is almost as if they are an official Union that has gone on strike so that people see the good in them. I'm usually sympathetic towards women's role in films of this genre which have the woman just because there should be a woman, a necessary prop of types. But, while Singham Returns gives Kareena Kapoor more than her share of screen space, the quality her appearance makes you wish it hadn't. She is more like a romantic-cum-comic relief used to elongate the runtime of the film. The romantic track is too long for the theme of the film, is annoying because it is loud and over-done, out-of-place because it doesn't seem to have received the writer's attention when compared to the rest of the film. It felt like a chore that they needed to get out of the way. It is also loud, undoubtedly and unnecessarily. I'd love to see a quieter version of the film without the romance and the comedy for sure.Somewhere on the top of the list of things that make the film loud is Kareena Kapoor. She is shrill and irritating and over-acting. This seems to rub off on other women characters even in the small bits they get like Constable Mahesh's wife and the woman from the slums who supports taking money from a political party for her vote. In comparison, the men seem to be in control. Even the caricature Godman baba that Amol Gupte plays looks mild in comparison, though by himself is over-the-top. Zakir Hussain too is appropriately arrogant and scared as a politician whose career is dependent upon which way the tide flows. In their midst is Ajay Devgn's soothing presence even if he doesn't emote much.  Even so, each one of them has unmissable screen presence, including Ashwini Kalsekar who plays the over-enthusiastic journalist. Setting aside the stretched romantic track and lame attempt at humor, even the action choreography and CGI seems half-hearted this time around. Except for a flying Ajay Devgn once in the entire film, there is no real attempt at adding an element of oomph to the action sequences. As difficult as I find it to believe, the focus is the story and the point its trying to make. That brings me to what some of the regular readers here are waiting to read - It is a Rohit Shetty film, that is a little less like a Rohit Shetty film, because it is actually trying to make sense while trying to keep what one expects from a Rohit Shetty film alive. Fortunately, more of the earlier than latter.

Sirf tells us this as plainly and boringly as possible. Yet the four couples' stories are woven well together, if only you could get interested in the stories by themselves.","Sirf is based on this very human aspect restricting itself to the man-woman relationship. Now if only, it had been just a little better in its execution. Or maybe it only needed to be just a little shorter. Sirf uses four couples from different income strata and age groups to display the strife that every couple may go through each phase in a relationship. While the premise is interesting and is held together by a decent enough story, the events are narrated very plainly and the story falls apart in the end. Everyday problems have improbable closures. Sirf takes a good 40-50 minutes to introduce you to all the eight main characters. It starts out with the problems that could be very similar to ones you and I or someone we know closely has faced. That should mean we identify with the characters, but strangely we don't. It just feels like you are listening to a not-so-close friend ramble on about her problems and you are trying your best to at least look interested. And by the time the stage is set things take unconvincing turns and the story gets out of hands for you to get any more interested than you originally were...not. And beyond the story, there's nothing much to appreciate. I can understand the lack of choice in terms of actors due to budget constraints. But my complaint is against the director not utilizing what he already had on board. At least four out of the eight actors are known for their performances - Kay Kay Menon, Ranvir Shorey, Sonali Kulkarni, and Parvin Dabas - yet you don't identify or sympathize with any of them. Also, the rest of the cast starts out really well and make you believe you just might be in for a treat, but na-a-ah. In fact, Rituparna Sengupta suddenly turns from a serious character into comic relief. You just don't know where to look when she goes into her most-annoying, supposedly-funny crying bout. It’s not that the writer/director hasn't tried. He tries in terms of connecting the four stories and he tries to add layers too. For example, I really liked how he tries to show what the younger couple is learning from the more experienced ones. I appreciate the attempt in trying to balance all things good and bad about urbania. But then, that has been done before, it could very well have been left behind. In trying to do too much, nothing is achieved.That is the main undoing. Sirf doesn't have focus. It doesn't know whether it wants to be serious or have comedy. It doesn't know whether it wants to make its point or have the commercial material fit in somehow (example: misplaced songs which are lackluster so they don't serve that purpose anyway). At the end of the 2-plus hours, I was in two minds too. Whether to spend more time on the film in writing this review or not. Sense of duty beckoned. I watched this film on satellite TV.

387,1087,1087,1087,1087,Sita Sings the Blues,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review3 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/sita-sings-blues-review/,,3/5.0,,2.966666667,You know you’re in for a treat the minute you see the level of animation in Sita Sings the Blues. It’s cute and simple and yet incorporates multiple layers to tell one legendary story. Paley has found a way to mix the two most strikingly opposite forms of art – the blues and traditional Indian mythology in a way that lends to the flavour of the film. It’s a set of vibrant versions of The Ramayana that should not be missed. ,"The Ramayana has been re-told and re-depicted countless times. I first heard of the story of Ram and Sita through my Grandmother, and back then it was a pretty straight one - a flat, legendary epic about morals and bravery. Most of us try to retain the tale as it is, which is why we have Ram-Leela and innumerable theatrical versions of The Ramayana, and I’m sure when I tell the story to my children, I won’t change it one bit. Sita Sings the Blues, on the other hand, celebrates the watered down versions of the Ramayana, as we know it now in the 2000s, in the most colourful, polychromatic manner possible.  Nina Paley’s Sita Sings the Blues is not just an animated version of The Ramayana. It incorporates multiple narratives of the same story, told in different settings and tones. The primary narrative is the epic tragedy – conveyed by animating static paintings/photographs of Sita, Rama, Ravana and Hanuman, which is backed with a morally serious voiceover.  This narrative serves the educational purpose of the film, using the traditional dramatic style of story telling. It sets it apart from the musical episodes of the Ramayana, which uses a more comfortable and digital animation. These episodes include jazz vocals of the 1920s by Annette Hanshaw, suggestively trying to imply a convergence between musical entertainment and tradition - also because story telling for us has now become just that. Sita sings the blues in this narrative to tell us her story. The most endearingly ironical parts of the movie are the two parallel narratives, which run alongside this vibrant play of characters. The first one uses shadow puppet animation, voiced by 3 Indians who seem to know only bits and pieces of the Ramayana, recite the tale in an urban and confused manner. One can relate to their recitation mostly because the language is colloquial, the facts are half-baked and derived by searching deep into those memories that have been passed down from generation to generation of every Indian home. It’s endearing because any of those voices could easily be me – and that is a striking vision on the director, Paley’s part. All of these multiple variations of the story are interspersed with a modern-day autobiographical account of a married couple (Nina and her husband) living in San Francisco, who face turbulences because the husband leaves for work to Trivandum. The animation is like a pencil cartoon, and the idea is to relate this with the sacred story only to contrast it with current day happenings. While on one hand, you have devotion and everlasting love between Sita and Ram, you also have an American couple that stands on the absolute other end of the spectrum. The DVD of Sita Sings the Blues also has a collection of the movie’s soundtrack – which is absolutely charming. Get hold of the DVD to learn more about Annette Hanshaw and for an audio interview with Nina Paley, where she discusses how the idea came to her, and more about her autobiographical story in the film.Sita Sings the Blues is an absolute deconstruction of conventional story-telling customs, which served one purpose and had one linear story. These parallel narratives whirlpool into one basic idea – In how many different ways can you tell the same story?  Each narrative uses different animation, a different tone – be it musical, modern or epic and they all come together to endorse plurality. It’s a plurality of understanding, plurality of ideas and plurality of existence.

388,1088,1088,1088,1088,Sixteen,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review15 Critic Reviews 3.2/5.0 1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/sixteen-review/,3.2/5.0,5/5.0,,3.966666667,The definition of fun has changed. I wonder if we will every catch up.,"Sixteen tries to be cool and the effort shows. The labour that such an effort requires shows through every department of the film and not in a good way. It's a film where everyone is trying their best, but unfortunately their best is only mediocre. Sixteen gives itself an air of importance. A sense that it is making some very crucial points. But it does so in such a disconnected manner, as if trying to symbolise the disconnect that the characters have towards most things around them. This doesn't allow you to feel with or for them. Maybe some sixteen year olds will identify with some of the characters, but I am not sure anyone is going to find more than a half-way affection.The first put-off is the dialogue delivery of all actors, except for maybe Zakir Hussain. The three lead ladies have a drawl that is annoying at first and then it becomes drab. It doesn't help that the dubbing is completely off. There is this a drunk scene with Wamiqa Gabbi who plays Tanisha where she shows some scope of doing something other than the regular drawl but that's too little to shake off the lazy way in which the lines are said.The sad bit is that there is potential. Some of the story lines, especially that between Tanisha and the paying guest (Keith Sequeira), had enough material to make for a film by itself. But, the writers had the burden of keeping the other stories going and the editors do a shabbier job of sticking them together. Sequences are literally stuck together.There are other times when the conversation has potential to get deep, introspective and interesting despite the awful dialogue delivery but it fizzles out. Anyway, I am not sure it'd have helped the broad stroke that every single sixteen year old is a weird shade of cool. I know a bunch of 15-16 year olds. They are confident, arrogant even. They don't value money as much as we did when we were that age. But, I doubt that they are as out there as the kids shown in Sixteen. Of course, I don't deny that teenagers do tend to have a casual attitude towards everything around them, but that can't be true of all them. Where are these represented in Sixteen? And if the film is not about those kids, then why have all characters that are pretty much the same, give or take. Then again, maybe all of real-life teenagers have another side that we as adults don't know about, just like the parents in this film.

389,1089,1089,1089,1089,Skyfall,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review3 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/skyfall-review/,,3/5.0,,3.3,"A more intense Bond film than the usual, Sam Mendes-directed Skyfall thankfully packs in no Mattel-worthy gadgets like the ones of old. Instead, it actually concentrates on themes other than 'cool'. A beautifully shot action film with a little less action than one would have liked, Skyfall is nevertheless great fun. ","Easily the most ubiquitous franchise in all of pop culture, a James Bond film is always an event. The franchise tilted ever-so-slightly towards the cerebral with the underwhelming Quantum of Solace. Continuing in that vein but dialing up the entertainment value by more than a notch, Skyfall, directed by the acclaimed Sam Mendes, infuses a sense of grounding and reality into the escapades of The Spy Who We Love. Skyfall isn't your usual James Bond film. The gadgetry, the Bond girls and the wise-crackery have all been toned down in favour of delivering a more emotional, personal film. This film also gives 007's boss M the longest screentime that she's ever had, which isn't a bad thing. That isn't to say that the film is particularly well-written. While the film is intriguing for the most, the writing in the last hour or so is surprisingly amateurish and tardy. Also, the film seemed to be at least two action-set pieces short. In spite of this, the film still works primarily because of Daniel Craig, director Sam Mendes, a delightfully evil villain in Silva, played by Javier Bardem and, most of all, the work of cinematographer Roger Deakins. The film dives straight into action, with 007 hot on the heels of a man who has stolen a top-secret 'list', one that is clearly headed into the wrong hands. One thrilling action set-piece later, Bond is presumed dead after M takes a call that leads to him being shot. However, the loss of her best agent turns out to be the least of M's worries, because a new threat is lurking in the shadows.Dressed in suits that fit him like his second skin, Daniel Craig's posture, his piercing, blue eyes and his rugged salt-and-pepper stubble make him the most intriguing Bond yet. There always seems to be so much unsaid when he is on the screen that it makes you root for the super-spy even more. Director Sam Mendes handles the action scenes well, the climactic sequence in particular. Though the writing is the weakest part of the film, Mendes manages to keep things continuously interesting. Javier Bardem as Silva is superb. His understated, unapologetic malice works so well because it makes him an unpredictable villain, right till the very end. Few Bond villains have been as intriguing and striking as him. Judi Dench returns as M and does a great job as always. Her no-nonsense, deadpan demeanour are a very integral part of this film, as are those almost deliberate wrinkles that add so much character to her presence.But Skyfall, in my opinion, belongs to the legendary Roger Deakins. His gorgeous frames and lighting, and his generous use of silhouettes and lens flares make Skyfall the most visually pleasing Bond film in memory. And it helps that few Bonds have ever looked as good in silhouette as Daniel Craig does. As mentioned earlier, the film could have done with a little more action. However, the action scenes that are there in the film, are superbly executed. Action works best when the VFX is camouflaged well, and in this film it almost always is. For those who are expecting a certain kind of Bond film, the kind where James Bond seems almost like a character out of an espionage-based comic book, Skyfall may be a bit of a letdown. I also got the feeling that a few members of the audience seemed to find the film a little too dialogue-heavy. However, there is much to appreciate in Skyfall, particularly for fans of the character and the genre. Skyfall, most certainly, raises expectations for the next one.

Slumdog Millionaire gives you all that and much more. In a unique setup the movie is so close to real life and at the same time takes you on a fantasy flight.It’s fast paced and touches upon big issues (like poverty, slums, religious riots, beggars of Mumbai, young criminals) in bits but still succeeds in making a huge impact on the viewers. The brilliantly shot chase sequence at the start sets you right into this fast moving story. The brilliant background music sets the tone for rest of the journey. I loved the way Hindi is used in the start of the movie to bring the authentic experience for the viewers.Smart use of background score helps you in shifting to completely different scenarios with ease. There are very few movies that can make you feel the pain, joy and emotions as the scenes flip by but Slumdog Millionaire does that with simplicity. The work put into making the movie be it script, story, screenplay or the music shows. All of this has been backed by excellent direction and brilliant acting by everyone. I tried hard to find a weak character in the movie but failed.Though it walks through some of the most complex situations yet it is a very simple movie and I believe that is what you would experience while watching it. The switch from Hindi to English comes as a bump on a road but again you are eased through the change with help of good background music. And for those who think that an illiterate kid on Indian streets cannot speak English you surely haven't been to Mumbai. The climax will give you a heightened sense of achievement, winning, content, sacrifice and excitement; and just like the rest of movie, all at the same time!Director Danny Boyle has pulled of an absolute peach of a movie. I am sure Co-Director Loveleen Tandan has helped him in capturing the right kind of Mumbai setup for the movie, which is the essence of the story. Another thing that makes Slumdog Millionaire a unique experience is the brilliant screenplay, thanks to Simon Beaufoy. All the actors look in control of their character be it Dev Patel, Freida Pinto, Tanay Chheda or the kids Azharuddin and Ayush. Anil Kapoor pulls off his role brilliantly. Remember he was supposed to fill in the shoes of Amitabh Bachhan and Shahrukh Khan as game show host, but then he twists it around and adds his own touch to the character. Convincing you that being in Bollywood for more than 2 decades he knows his business. The real star of the movie is A R Rahman with his superb background score especially the pieces ""O Saya"" and ""Latika's Theme"" which you will end up humming long after the movie is over.Thinking about the movie on my way back to home I was caught up in confusion if it is a movie about dreams, hope, sore relations, the reality of life of a slumdog or is it about the luck of a random boy. I am convinced that it is about all that but more than that it is about love. Yes it is a love story.

It would have been a far more interesting film had the makers decided to toy around with gender roles and the clear good versus bad battle. ","Is anyone else worried about the future of the fairytales we grew up with? How have we come to a place where we have to think twice about taking children to a Snow White film? I’m not opposed to adaptations, but if the only purpose of the adaption is to make a grotesque, violent version of a tested narrative, why choose one that has been used as a bedtime story for children for years? How would you feel if suddenly tomorrow Goofy turned out to be an evil-menacing werewolf-cum-canine who has ferocious animosity against humans? Similarly, while Snow White and The Hunstman is mysteriously dark and has the potential to be a memorable action-fantasy film with stunningly creepy visuals and performances, it seems like making a violent adaption was the primary motive. In which case, I would have preferred the violence and ruggedness be translated into a different plot. The basic story of the film is the same – after killing the king, Snow White’s father, Ravenna (Charlize Theron), the evil step-mother imprisons Snow White (Kristen Stewart) in the castle. Vanity is Ravenna’s vice, and in pursuit to be the fairest of them all, she is willing to go to any measure. The dwarves aren’t characterized as Sleepy, Happy, Bashful etc; nor is Snow White the demure damsel in distress. While this deconstruction seems refreshing on paper, the plot goes in no particular direction. Ultimately, Kristen Stewart’s performance is cold and you can’t tell the difference between her in Twilight and in this film. Chris Hemsworth also looks like he’s dropped out of Thor, into the film. Besides, his role is almost negligible. Charlize Theron is the star performer of the film – positively sinister and she does make you flinch more than once. The rugged quality of the film however, is brought out well. Snow White and The Huntsman serves as an interesting adaptation with potential as compared to Mirror Mirror that was released earlier this year. This is mostly because the mood of the film takes an entire 180 degree turn from the original fairytale. Writer Hossein Amini (of Drive fame) and first time director Rupert Sanders together bring together a gritty texture that does manage to engross you in bits. While the action is more visual effects-heavy and seems a bit forced, the colors and the mood make up for the below-average acting and manage to suck you at particular points during the film.For these reasons particularly, you feel angry that the end result of the film resembles a complacent effort. With a rough makeover of a celebrated fairytale, Snow White and The Huntsman could have been powerful and much more immersive. For now, the film can be lauded for its attempt, but mostly you feel a rising sense of disappointment from the end result.

movie. It is the story about the founders of Facebook. And I say
'founders' because it is as much the story of Eduardo Saverin (Andrew
Garfield)  as it is of Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg). It is the
story of how money and success changes the equation between the people
behind Facebook. The tagline of the movie couldn't have been more
accurate - You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few
enemies. We've seen it with Bill Gates and now, we've seen it with
Zuckerberg. You can't achieve so much without stepping onto some
stones. And Mark sure stepped on plenty. So this movie is about
heartbreak, friendship, greed, betrayal, success and of course,
Facebook.","With over 500 million users, Facebook is by far, the largest social
networking site around. Facebook started in a Harward dorm room in
2003 by Mark Zuckerberg who went on to become the youngest billionaire
in the world. The movie uses the lawsuits against Mark, to tell the
back-story of how he came to achieve all that he did, pretty much like
Slumdog Millionare used the show 'Who wants to become a millionaire'
to carry their story forward. And like Slumdog Millionare, here too,
the formula worked like a charm. In pieces, it showed the changes in
Mark's character from the time he was a neglected undergrad to the
time he became a billionaire.I've grown up reading stories about Bill Gates and how many people he
allegedly wronged on his path to success. Its Zuckerberg's time to be
under the torch. The movie would leave you with mixed emotions. You'd
love Mark for his genius and his passion towards Facebook. At the same
time you'd hate him for his cockiness and betrayals. So after the
movie, be prepared to jump in to the intense debates of who wronged
whom and how much of the movie is fact and how much is fiction. Its
good fun, as from ex-Facebook CTOs, employees and founders all are
having their say over the matter. Coming back to the movie, Aaron
Sorkin did a great job with the script. It was driven with sharp
dialogues that make this movie a fast paced entertainer, and not a
documentary. The surprise package for me was Justin Timberlake in the
role of Sean Parker. I had little hopes from him, but he pulled off the
role pretty nicely. Also, if you don't know the story behind Sean
Parker, do read it after watching the movie and you'd love his
character more.All in all, The Social Network, is a brilliant movie to watch, to enjoy,
to get inspired and to have a healthy debate with friends.
Release date for India couldn't have been timed better with all the
heat between Google and Facebook. Also Facebook is rumored to launch
its alleged Gmail-killer soon. And we thought Microsoft vs Apple was
the epic battle. I won't be surprised to see a sequel a few years down
the line about either Facebooks downfall or about it, dominating the
world. Time shall tell. The only turn-off for me was all the
programmers in the movie were made to talk really fast. They always
make the geeks talk fast. Its like an unsaid code.
We-don't-talk-that-fast. Wait. May-be-we-do. Dayum!

Talking about the film is as predictably pointless as the film itself. The exaggerated action sequences and silly comedy may entertain some of the audience, but as a film-crazy nation, we surely deserve far better. ","If the missing vowel in ‘Ajay Devgn’ has been puzzling you, you must know that his company’s name is Ajay Devgn Ffilms. Yes, the double-F in ‘ffilms’ is not a typo. Clearly, ffilm people seem to assume that India’s collective IQ dives far south during the festive season. While that may not be entirely false, I am sure that at least logic and the laws of physics are a tad bit more universal than the buffoonery that some of our big, festive releases subject us to. Mildly amusing at best and capable of inducing seizures at its worst, Son of Sardaar is the kind of film that will exhaust all synonyms of the word ‘silly’ and come out grinning, proud of its existence for reasons that the more discerning amongst us will find difficult to fathom.The plot (I’m being mighty generous by using that word for this film) has something to do with a generations-old bloodthirsty family feud that has kept Jassi (our hero, Ajay Devgn) the last surviving member of the Randhawa clan, away from India for 25 years. He returns to stake claim on his ancestral land, blissfully unaware that while he may no longer hold grudges, his arrival has been long-awaited by the Sandhu clan, led by Balvinder Singh Sandhu aka Billu, played by Sanjay Dutt. You see, Billu walked out of his own wedding 25 years back, swearing to kill every last member of the Randhawas before he gets married. If the plot seems as old as the hills, the treatment is, expectedly, as juvenile as it can get.I must confess that when I even begin to think of the sheer volume of braindead-ery this film contains, I feel like I’m being an obsessive-compulsive maniac, because clearly there is an audience out there for this kind of film. I refuse to believe, however, that exaggerated action and comedy must necessarily entail you to treat yourself like you don’t own a brain for two-and-a-half hours of your life. Not surprisingly, stereotypical jokes about the intellect of the Sikhs abound in this film. In fact, the whole film is set in a village full of dunderheads, not all of whom are Sikh. I often wondered if the point of the film was to show that anyone living in Punjab uses his brain as sparingly as the people behind this film. For a film that has comedy as one of its two primary ‘pillars’, the jokes are mainly banal, lent credibility sporadically because the actors delivering the lines aren’t half bad. The film’s other supposed pillar is the action, which is also one of the weakest bits. Apart from the fact that they don’t seem to feel even slightly original and visionary, some of the execution is just tacky. CG-generated fake skies don’t help in any way.If people find the film even slightly watchable, it is because of the actors. Ajay Devgn is goofy and endearing; Sanjay Dutt has a frightening yet charming air about him and Sonakshi Sinha, who seems to want to only do films that look like they’ll make it into that ridiculous ‘club’ of you-know-how-many crores, is actually passably pleasant in the bits that don’t require her to pretend like she is dancing with gay abandon. Mukul Dev, fresh out of cold storage, has a couple of silly lines that work quite well. The pick of the cast, though, is Juhi Chawla, who seems to be the only sensible character in the village-with-no-IQ.This Diwali, Son of Sardaar is clearly the greater of two evils, though there is no doubt that the film is going to entertain the audience in smaller centers to the hilt. For people who liked Rowdy Rathore, Bodyguard and the likes, congratulations – chances are you’ll like this one too. For others, I think I have made the point amply clear.

394,1094,1094,1094,1094,Sona Spa,Switch channels if it's on cable,wogma reviewPreview18 Critic Reviews 0.4/5.0 17 Tweet Reviews 0.6/5.0,/movie/sona-spa-review/,0.4/5.0,,0.6/5.0,4.0,Sona Spa is a metaphorical treat for reviewers. A film about a spa that cures insomnia is itself bland enough to put you to bed.,"It'd be safe to say that of the five people who showed up for the screening that I was at, at least 4 of them were there for Naseeruddin Shah. And what a cheat that turned out to be. Not that I was surprised. And actually, the tone he was talking in for the few seconds he is on screen, I am only thankful that there wasn't more of him. The film otherwise, is pretty much what you see in the trailers. There are people who can't sleep for whatever reason. There are other people who sleep well and through some ""bonding"" one from the latter group can sleep on behalf of one from the former group relieving the stress. As we are told (again in the trailer itself) if someone sleeps your sleep, they are also going to dream your dreams. There's no new knowledge beyond that, for the characters barely do anything after having new knowledge about each other. Obviously, the dreams makes for the bulk of Sona Spa and we would have such a boring if film if these dreams weren't deep and dark secrets of the sleepless people. Now, how people who don't sleep dream so that people who are sleeping for them can dream the same dream, is a minor technicality and thus not addressed at all. Even so, what an interesting premise this was for some psychoanalysis! The original person's dream is a representation of his deepest desires/insecurities. The dream though is so real for the sleep-worker that they believe them to be true. But, none of this is explored at all.Instead you get some superficial philosophical talk using lines that are supposed to sound profound. Except for Nivedita Bhattacharya (Meenakshi), Aahana Kumrah (Ritu) and the guy who plays Sachin (Indira's brother) all other actors are mostly stiff and the three mentioned are better only in comparison. Pooja Pradhan (Indira) actually looks like she's being held together by the make-up plastered on her face. In fact, the cinematography is so grainy that you can see the smallest pore on everyone's face. I don't know what artistic purpose this serves, but even in real life you cannot see the face in such gruesome detail. If only you saw even a fraction of that detail in coming up with stories of insomniacs that were complete. Or at least they'd have some meaning for the viewer, even if the meaning wasn't deciphered or understood completely. Watching Sona Spa is like having 15-20 minute boring dream played on repeat for two hours. I really wonder how Sona Spa would've turned out if it were a short.

395,1095,1095,1095,1095,Sonali Cable,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review1 Reader Review 0/5.0,/movie/sonali-cable-review/,,0/5.0,,,"One of the rare cases where I allow myself to use the cliché, ""Had it's heart in the right place, but...""","Sonali Cable surprisingly begins to engage you the common man being stuck in the deep nexus between politicians and businessmen. You've seen the nexus earlier, and you know the stuck common man all too well. Yet, the story unfolds showing every seemingly powerful person having someone more powerful than them call the shots and hooks you in. Unfortunately, it finds itself in a rut for a bit and then crumbles and resolves itself all too suddenly.Sonali Cable picks an issue that seems to be close to the makers' hearts. With a slight left of center inclination, it tries to plead its case of the injustice faced by small business owners who are stubbed out by macho businesses with clout and resources. For a bit, you might wonder if it is contradicting itself by showing the humble beginnings of the big business owner and the small business owner dreaming big. But it tries to sneak in a meek ""it's the how that is wrong, not the what.""Yet, most of Sonali Cable could've worked had it raised the tempo to a hilt in the climax with something more than an unimaginative end to the proceedings. It built up pretty well and it is a shame that the finish felt rushed and a make-do arrangement. Fortunately, the characters are engaging and some of the lines are interesting. It is refreshing to see the lady take a lead in a film of this budget and nature. At times Sonali's character even is completely independent of whether or not she has her boyfriend, Raghu's support. She carried a ""good to have, but don't need"" kind of an attitude towards him - not something you easily find in Hindi films.Sonali is played by Rhea Chakraborty who looks so much like Genelia D'Souza. Once I got past that I realised that the least you can say about Rhea Chakraborty is that she is earnest. You can tell she's trying hard, yet within a film or two, given the right role, she could very easily wow you. You sense her character, Sonali's chemistry with Ali Fazal's character, Raghu in the scenes where they start getting intimate. Raghu is a support to Sonali and Ali Fazal plays it out with the constraint that a supporting actor should play his part with.Anupam Kher's Waghela on the other hand, sticks to your memory, as an annoying over-the-top rags-to-riches story that you'd rather forget. But that is what the character is meant to do. Smita Jaykar too leaves behind a strong performance. Interestingly, the rest of departments of film-making, except maybe the lyrics of the songs, are so unspectacular that they draw your attention to the fact that the focus is the issue at hand. Sonali Cable wanted to make a point and it has tried its best to not lose focus. Unfortunately, though, it feels a little long drawn out with a tame ending. Yet, there are some bits that stay with you, bit that you can watch the whole film for once.

396,1096,1096,1096,1096,[The] Song of Sparrows,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/song-sparrows-review/,,,,,"Perhaps the last Majid Majidi film to have found international acclaim, The Song of Sparrows is an Iranian treasure. Ostriches, goldfish, kids, Reza Naji and the wonderful people of Iran. Fans of Majidi’s works will know it’s a typical formula - a character in dilemma to fulfill a purpose. But it’s the journey where Majidi spins magic. It’s a genuine mood lifter, highly deserving of repeat viewing. Winner of Best Actor at the Berlin International Film Festival (2008) and nominated for Golden Berlin Bear.","Majid Majidi’s universe is full of do-gooders. It’s where you can trust people with your money. No matter how economically challenged you are, you’re always kind to share your meal with a guest. Customers at a shop don’t whisk away extra-change you may have handed over by mistake. People are extremely hospitable, welcoming and innocent. Crime, murders are unheard of. People tell lies, but for a larger good. There are no human villians in his films. If any, the enemy is a product of circumstances - often intangible, something the protagonist must overcome. That’s exactly the context of The Song of Sparrows. Karim (Reza Naji) who works at an ostrich farm on the outskirts of Tehran, wants to loan some money from his boss, so that he can buy a hearing aid for his daughter since the one she used to wear has stopped working after it fell in a dirty cesspool. Poor Karim faces an uphill task to generate that money, after he gets fired from his job thanks to a moment of  carelessness that leads an ostrich to escape from the farm.The Song of Sparrows captures Karim’s loss of innocence as he frequents the city every day posing as a motorbike pilot who ferries people and heavy goods. Although he earns well by doing this, every piece of city scrap he begins to accumulate in his backyard becomes a symbol of the degradation of the generous and good-hearted Karim he was once known for.It’s a fantastic message, told most beautifully through simple vignettes - Karim’s refusal to part with a beautiful blue door his wife donated to the neighbours, his violent outrage when he spots his children selling roses on the highway - all these become signs of a Karim who is now as acid tongued as the grime his face  accumulates driving around the city all day. Through Karim’s character, Majidi’s not saying that life in the city is bad; he’s just saying that people change when they spend a lot of time in an urban setup. It’s a universal truth, isn’t it? Something snaps inside Karim in this daily grind to the city. He loses something that his family and friends treasured about him. The film’s plot is about how he regains his old self, under pressure from circumstances and a little help from his family.Visually, this is one of Majidi’s most arresting films - so arresting, you can almost smell the Irani soil. The first 15 minutes of the film are pure eye candy where lensman Tooraj Mansuri’s camera captures the grace of an ostrich run and the aburdity of a chase, against the dry landscape. They are my most lasting impressions of the film. The close-ups of Karim’s face throughout the course of the film are important - you discover that Reza Naji is so good, just a tweak of his cheek muscles is worth a thousand emotions stirred up inside him.Majidi’s films always have a hidden relationship with water. It’s also a case in The Song of Sparrows, except he adds another regular from his films - goldfish. Part of the film’s official poster, a scene involving the transportation of hundreds of goldfish, is the most moving sequences in the film, shot with Majidi’s characteristic slow-motion. I found myself in tears by the end of it.I’ve seen almost all of Majidi’s internationally acclaimed films so far - Children of Heaven, The Colour of Paradise, Pedar, Baran. This film is the latest addition. As it got over and I settled down to mull over the film, I found myself asking one question: Does Majidi’s universe really exist? Are Persians genuinely as good as Majidi portrays them to be? Interestingly, while I may not be sure about answers to those questions, I’m at least convinced about one thing - we always manage to sympathise with the protagonists of his films. Perhaps that’s why people all over the world love his films. Perhaps that’s why they’re acclaimed by both critics and audiences globally - a feat sometimes very difficult to achieve. Perhaps that’s why they call him Magic Majidi.

But, that curiosity is almost always met with repetitive reaction shots and a lame twist.","Possessive friend becomes manipulative because his friend’s fiancée is a schemer and manipulative. Why she is manipulative? Your guess is as good as mine. It ought to be enough for us that the possessive friend thinks so. The resultant back and forth between the friend and the fiancée are just about interesting. But they become repetitive and tiring. To begin with the premise of characters manipulating their friends and significant others is not very engaging. It is not that I don’t know that manipulative people exist in the real world. I am sure they do. It’s just that, I don’t find their stories interesting. Once you figure that this character can go to any extent to get their way, they become predictable. Of course, to the extent that you are already in the theater watching the film, and we don’t know what they are going to do next, you are interested in finding out. But that bit of curiosity is also dealt with ‘meh’ twists. It doesn’t help here that you can predict the film-making. At least 7-8 times in the second half, I caught myself thinking, “now, she is going to make that eye gesture that says she is unfazed and has a smart move up her sleeve” or “now, he is going to look at her from that mirror” or “don’t tell me they are going to look at each other with that smug smile as if no one else is watching” or “please-please-please don’t make her wink with a death-stare in slow-motion in the next scene”. And that is exactly what happened. To the word. Predictability to the shot level makes the film have a Hindi TV serial like quality. Not to mention the petty, dining table politics. This and the thick woman-bashing attitude of Luv Ranjan’s film is getting tiring. I tried very hard to treat it as just a story between two friends and one’s significant other. But, the flavour seemed to be especially anti-woman. I even tried to give it the benefit of doubt, that maybe it was their style of satire. But, so deep is the regressive attitude that the filmmakers seem oblivious and ignorant of the stereotyping. There was this one shot in a party song, one of the guys goes to this woman who he has presumably met for the first time. She is wearing glasses. He takes those glasses off and gestures that she is looking nice. There’s something inherently creepy about this. And this is our protagonist, who we are supposed to like?At this point, I think I am putting more thought into the writing than the writers ever intended to. Because the characters are of course uni-dimensional. But, you see only one aspect of their single dimension too. Sonu (Kartik Aaryan) is annoyingly know-it-all. Titu (Sunny Singh Nijjar) is naive and dumb. We know this about Sonu and Titu only from one aspect of their lives – Sonu’s girlfriend, Sweety (Nushrat Bharucha). Sweety on the other hand, is interested in making sure Sonu doesn’t succeed in getting her out of Titu’s life. Now, why she wants what she wants seems to be irrelevant. In that sense, the entire film seems to have no rhyme or reason. The very premise of the film is suspicion about Sweety’s intentions and we are pretty much asked to take that basis for suspicion for granted. For what the film purports, she would have to be playing a long, long game like a professional con artist. In that sense, the writing is just happy sticking to what it has built on in previous films. Since no Luv Ranjan rom-com can come without a Kartik Aryan monologue and they don’t want it to become repetitive, he takes off right at the beginning but it’s not about women. So, much for creativity. It is amusing when the writer actually has Sonu admire the writing by repeating how smartly the previous scene was written. You know, just in case the audience didn’t notice. Only that it was not. The actors do what we are used to seeing them do. Except for Alok Nath, who plays a quirky, adorable, and a not-so-sanskari grandfather. It was a joy to watch him so. But that doesn’t mean his track in the film belonged. While focused on the ‘friend’ versus ‘girl’ competition, Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety also has these extraneous tracks that unnecessarily lengthen the film. Considering the central track is run-down and annoying by the writer-director’s own standards, that leaves very little in the ‘watchable’ category.

If only the resolution didn't seem funny and thus out-of-place.","Skip the italicized bits to read review. The italicized bits are my thoughts on the on-going war in Mumbai interspersed in between the review.Over 40 hours since the country has been held hostage. Each one of us hostage to TV channels, internet reports, or twitter and some of us hostages inside the Taj, or The Oberoi or Nariman House.  Each one either scared or worried or angry or frustrated or some combination thereof. But each one of us helpless. What can we do? Abuse the government, opposition, media? Did that and got bored within 20 minutes. What else can I do? The only thing I can think of is to panic as little as possible and continue the routine. So here I am doing what I do every Friday. Trying, albeit unsuccessfully, to ignore what's happening 150kms away, trying to keep my angst on the world outside from making a judgment on the world inside the dark, secure(?) cinema hall. Bold themes and atypical resolutions are fascinating. And this time around Onir explores relationships in detail - the love angle, the love triangle, the husband-wife, the parent-son. Unexpectedly though, the brother-brother relationship is left half-baked, even untouched. Yet, there is enough in there to keep you engrossed and wonder, what next?The basic premise, the love triangle, takes you through the confusion of the mature characters. There's no beating around the bush. The characters all behave like a normal person in that situation would. The second premise feels like it is right out of a Mahabharat side-story that made it to an Amar Chitra Katha comic of its own. Boons and curses. And then the inevitable loophole or way-out of the curse. It was comical too, but very contemporary. At one point I actually thought Shabana Azmi was going to pull a KuntiMaybe I'm just seeing war where there isn't any...Sharman Joshi is just awesome as the unsure guy who is torn-between-two ideologies. Chitrangadha Singh looks ravishing and convinces us that she's one confused woman. Boman Irani as the daddy cool, and Shabana Azmi as the mom wanting to fit in with the new generation, are used more as comic relief. But they fill the screen with life even when they are taunting or angry. The chemistry this cute, oldie couple shares makes you want to be like them, when you are older.I want to grow old. I don't want to die today. I want lessons on how to be that sarcastic mom-in-law...Of course, the witty lines - funny or otherwise - help every one set the right mood throughout the movie. Your heart might not reach out to any single character, because none of them want to do the ""right thing"". But, except for Harry's (Sanjay Suri's) exaggerated selfishness, the situations are real enough for us to keep judgment at bay too. Each character seems right in their confined space. And the lines get blurry, as they always do, as you add in external factors - people or situations. This is one of those movies I'd watch again when I'm in a less agitated frame-of-mind. If not for the unusual storyline and climax, as a study of characters.Yes, the situation has improved and the mind feels more relaxed now...gotten used to it? Already??Stay safe!!

399,1099,1099,1099,1099,Soundtrack,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma reviewNotepad28 Critic Reviews 3.1/5.0 2 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/soundtrack-review/,3.1/5.0,3/5.0,,3.5333333330000003,"Soundtrack starts unsurely, mildly irritates while casually displaying a wasted life amidst drugs, alcohol and sex and then grips you into a story that makes you want good things to happen to a person you didn't like much or worse, were indifferent to. ","Soundtrack starts out with us following pretentious-looking Raunak (Rajeev Khandelwal). Raunak is seen tapping his feet and stopping to lend an ear to the rhythms of life. Having seen and liked Rajeev Khandelwal's earlier work I assumed that Raunak must actually be shallow and fake in terms of his understanding of music. But turns out that he actually has a good ear for music. Which means Rajeev Khandelwal isn't doing a good job. The sinking feeling gets worse with the OD of drugs, alcohol and sex. And then the story begins and boy did it suck me in - both because of the performances and the narration. Soundtrack is a good example of a simple, predictable story told with a heart and devotion. You start out either hating or being unmoved by a character and in the next hour you find yourself caring for him. You want him to do well, however predictable that makes the film. This is achieved with mediocre production values. There is no fancy camerawork; neither are gimmicks used to depict the neurosis Raunak is going through. The only thing above average is the sound design. That too, there isn't anything marvelous about it. And even though these tools aren't used, the narrative engages the audience. Rajeev Khandelwal doesn't disappoint one bit. In hindsight, even his act in the first 10-15 minutes can be overlooked as Raunak is a rather cocksure and selfish character. I totally loved Soha Ali Khan, her real act starts way into the second half and yet when you come out, her character has left an impression and a couple of scenes to remind you of her. Soundtrack runs along the themes of life, its uncertainties and how people deal with or completely fail to deal with what is dealt to them. But, it also indirectly touches upon mental illnesses. While the solution Soundtrack comes up with might not be medically sound, probable or correct; the importance of strong will depicted in overcoming those odds is a slim ray of hope for people when they go through dark times. And the most important reason why Soundtrack works for me is that it is based on a true-life story. The impact of those two words, ""true life"" is enough to give Soundtrack a shot. And I'd recommend a theater watch, just because the impact could be lost/reduced if it is watched with interruptions/distractions.

If it were not for some witty dialogue delivered with great timing, Special Chabbis would've been a very frustrating experience.","When Special Chabbis ends, you go through the entire film in your mind (you are helped by some repeated scenes in the end) and you realize that some of the scenes were in the film, only to put you off track from cracking the mystery. Why else would people who know each other talk like strangers when they are by themselves in the story?Till then, you are holding on through Akshay Kumar, Anupam Kher and some of the others moving in slo-mo just because this is made by the guy who made A Wednesday - this HAS to lead to something good. In fact, the entire film feels like it is moving in slow motion, even when the camera is doing its job at regular speed. And yet you are giving it leeway. Good thing that smart one-liners delivered with some really good timing keep you interested in the film. That doesn't mean that the performances are top-notch. Except for Anupam Kher and Manoj Bajpayee, the rest are just plain. I cannot deny that it's a relief to see Akshay Kumar in a role where he isn't at his ""comic"" antics. Kajal Aggarwal is here only so that the fairer gender have some representation. Divya Dutt is given just the one line to repeat whenever it is predictably appropriate and the third woman is around just so she can  be told by her husband to wear a dupatta! The way the camera moves along the women's curves makes this film as respectful of women as any other film with an item number for X-factor. These are the things you don't expect after watching A Wednesday. Yes, with that one Neeraj Pandey had set up competition for himself with himself. I enjoyed the set-up. The film gives its audience the time to figure things out for themselves. Especially the 'who's who and doing what' bit isn't aided by people talking to each other as if they are meeting for the first time, or a voice-over trying to help us out. However, that becomes a bit of a drab later, as you feel you are continuously in an exposition mode. In fact, given the end, the entire film feels just like an introduction to a sequel, if not a series of films. It is sad then, to see out-of-place stylization and the lackluster conclusion. Also, when lead players in the film are not going to be nice people, you need a good amount of background about them, to be able to root for them. None of the lead characters, except Mr. Sharma (Anupam Kher) to a certain extent, get you invested in them. Nothing to keep you hooked through out. Sure, there is the sentiment of hurting the corrupt of our nation, of giving them what they deserve. But, it seemed half-baked and felt like it was a comment in the passing. Another side note is that no one in our country's administration and law enforcement believes in something as basic as checking credentials. Are we such a trusting nation?Yet, if you can forgive the writer in Neeraj Pandey for going out of his way to fool you into believing something, there are a couple of twists that do make you smile because of the way the characters seem to be outsmarting each other. But, along with that you have a lame love story, a few quirks that exist just for the sake of being quirky, and con-jobbers who are written more to con you than each other.

But, oh well, that's not to be. The songs are bad and the picturization worse. The only saving grace is a couple of action sequences.","There are a few ingredients in thrillers that are pretty much indispensable.  And ""Speed"" is missing those crucial elements. You need a main hero who oozes style. Sorry, two who don't ooze style won't do. Same goes for the villain. Then you need the one-liners - you might roll your eyes when they are said, but you have to agree a thriller is incomplete without them. And most importantly - an engaging plot! See, we know it’s an average thriller, so we know the earth won't shatter into a zillion pieces. But, at least make a teeny-weeny attempt to engross us in your narrative.Again, out-of-this-world performances are not expected. Just enough to move the story along. And that, the not-so-stellar cast accomplishes. We could have done with a little less excited Zayed Khan, though. And why on earth was Aftab Shivdasani sporting the Mahendra Dhoni look? It is amazing how Aftab can wear the same expression, no matter who he is made to look like. I am not sure whether I can completely blame the actors for the lack of style. The lamest dialogues ever were fit into those two hours. How stylistically can you deliver lousy lines after all?The plot tries to strike a balance between two main threads, at least two mini-threads, 4 actors, and their ladies. That's a whole lot, and thus the loss of focus and mismanagement of pace is not really a surprise. I really didn't like the way the motivation of the villains unfolds for us. Too little, too late. What I did like though, are the action sequences saved for Zayed Khan. They are very-well choreographed and executed. The songs are dull too - lyrics, music, picturization, choreography, etc. Particularly bad is the one which is supposedly a love scene. People, decide - either be bold enough to show a couple actually making love, or skip it! You are fooling no one by using silly editing techniques to imply that the twosome is actually doing anything.Another director going from bad to worse. Another movie with actors continuing to do what they do in every other movie. Another story that needed at least another year's worth of work. Another few songs that the cine-goer could have survived without. Another wannabe entertainer released this Friday.

Not one single thing happens that you wouldn't have been able to tell from the trailer, if not from the title of the film. From the family problems, to the relationships, to the outcome of the grand championship. As typical, an underdog film, as it could get. ","Indians living abroad. Oh, what a rotten life they have! They have to make an identity for themselves, especially in a sport. So, what do they do? They make a team that has only Indians, naaah...these particular people are Punjabis, so they make a team of only Punjabis to fight the goras (Whites). Such is the convoluted interpretation of liberalism and/or nationalism. Fine, I wasn't supposed to expect anything else from a film that calls itself Speedy Singhs. But, shouldn't there be at least a ghost of a story. Some conflict that will make me wonder what's to happen next. Let alone that, the conflict itself is predictable. So, then, we have stand-up comedian Russell Peters and chocolate boy Vinay Virmani to look forward to. Or not. Though, it is imperative to mention that I saw a dubbed version of the film, which means all the actors were speaking out translations of English dialogues in Hindi in the utmost ridiculous fashion, you know like Night at a Museum in Hindi. Yes, Rob Lowe too! Oh, how I felt for one of my favorite West Wing actors. The bhangra, the toilet jokes, and given there's Russell Peters, there are the racial, political incorrect humor too. None of it entertains or makes me laugh. It just felt like one of the films that make you go numb even if they are short.

It has not retained any playful, fantastical element of the first film, not even Antonio Banderas! On the contrary, Spy Kid 4D is quite transparent in its agenda – the fast food joint merchandise. ","Robert Rodriguez – really? Where has the Rodriguez of Sin City and Planet Terror disappeared? After watching the fourth installment of the Spy Kids series, I happened to pass by a McDonalds – where I was bombarded with more merchandise from Spy Kids. It makes me wonder – is this the same director? Spy Kids – All The Time In The World or Spy Kid 4D is the fourth movie from the Spy Kids series, dealing with a Spy Kids department that has now become world famous in solving crimes. It is sparked off from the first movie where kids Carmen and Juni (Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara) help their parents (who are spy agents) with an espionage mission. Spy Kid 4D tells us about the aftermath of the success of the OSS (world’s top spy agency). Jessica Alba joins the film with her two step children Rebecca and Cecil (Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook) to fight against a sinister Timekeeper (Jeremy Piven) who attempts to take over the world.To be fair, the first movie, plain and simple Spy Kids, was a fresh film filled with mazes, codes, pranks and anagrams. It gave many children that fantastical space, which was unexplored before the Harry Potter series. But as we’ve seen with many films (especially with children’s films in Hollywood) – by the 4th installment you have a star to make the film’s worth triple fold (Alba) – high technological placing (4D, and we’ll take about that later) and no story. It’s pretty much like a moving, technology spewing version of the very toy I see at fast food joints. Alba takes her kids along with her on the mission, and so Rodriguez manages to throw in a few laughs here and there – all of it banks on the scatological humour, which does work with most kids. But other than that it seems like he’s written the movie in his sleep. The overall effect of the film – with its watered down visual effects, bad chroma backgrounds and horrid acting on almost everyone’s part is not worth your time, to put it mildly. You almost wonder if the film was made for lesser than Rodriguez’s $7000 debut El Mariachi.The Indian release however has not seen a 4D effect at all. The film promises a 4D Aromascope effect which allows you smell and feel the film as well. Except, I was given regular 3D glasses and nothing more. And I’m not even surprised. I’m told not many multiplexes in the country have actually followed the 4D scheme. The film does have a Rodriguez watermark on it though – we see a few witty moments and the entire series is Hispanic dominated, one thing that remains a constant. Kids will find the robot dog (voiced by Ricky Gervais) pretty amusing, as he’s stupid and funny with the humour. For those who have been following the series, Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino (parents from the previous films) will be missed – but much respect to them for staying out of this one.I was all set to write a super nasty piece on how Hollywood is considering kid’s entertainment the biggest commercial venture of the decade; and then I realized something. If Robert Rodriguez gets the leverage to indulge in independent films like From Dusk Till Dawn series, Machete and other classics like The Faculty and Desparado – because he makes commercials sewers like these, I think we can allow him this mistake.

It brings out irony that is part of everyday life. It comments on a blistering issue in society, but it doesn't let the issue take over the film. But it is also very slow and predictable. ","Stanley ka Dabba, the title by itself warmed me up to the film. I used to be that lazy one in school who'd never get her ""tiffin box"". And this is after my little sister would pack it early in the morning. I don't know, my own dabba just never was fascinating enough. Years later, as I watch Stanley ka Dabba, I realize maybe it was a 'bonding' thing for me. Many friends made over shared parathas and buscuits. Sure, Stanley's reason for not bringing food for himself is as far from laziness as it could be, but the fact that he didn’t have his meal with him brought the same result. Many friends and lovely memories. Despite this fondness though, Stanley ka Dabba seemed slow, predictable and repetitive in its 95 minute duration. Stanley ka Dabba's promo also makes you believe that there is going to be something really deep in the film that will take repeated viewings to deconstruct. It raises a question about Stanley's background that remains unanswered till the last ten minutes of the film. By then, you have pretty much made up your own sad story about his family and probable life-style situation. And the climax gives you exactly that. In that sense, the film is unpredictable, right? You were expecting something more, something beyond the superficial but didn't get it. But who says every film has to have a zen moment of realization? For what it is, Stanley ka Dabba is perfectly enjoyable because of its simplicity and how relatable it is. A science teacher who constantly asks you to stick to the norms, a unreasonable Hindi teacher who insists that the Goddess of knowledge will oblige only if you use the right hand. Stanley ka Dabba is all about simple things like these and the fact that every student who has come out of a traditional Indian school environment will find something to smile at. And if you can't identify with the events of the film, there's always Stanley to smile with. Partho plays the charming Stanley, a master story-teller, who has a very strong self-esteem. In fact, all the kids in the film are perfect in their roles - almost as if they aren't acting at all. The kids in the theater around me seemed to love every minute they spent with Stanley. They didn't seem to mind the slow pace or the repetition. It didn't matter that there seemed to be no valid reason for the angst and resolution thereof between Stanley and his Hindi teacher. Nor did they care that the climax does nothing outside the box. The protagonist is the hero and has a story that tugs the right strings for that lumpy throat. I'm really curious how the film is going to be liked at film festivals both Indian and international. The context is very Indian. In fact, it is documentation of the education system and the culture revolving in schools in India. Fortunately, the ""new-age"" schools might be changing the teacher-facing experience. Unfortunately though it might be changing the dabba experience too.

405,1105,1105,1105,1105,Star Trek Into Darkness,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/star-trek-darkness-review/,,3/5.0,,3.166666667,"J J Abrams has certainly bitten off more than he can chew. Star Trek Into Darkness is a film that barely manages to be watchable, primarily because of Benedict Cumberbatch, who unfortunately appears for far less time on screen than he deserves. Fanboys apart, there is very little that this film has to offer to anyone else.","If you’re a sci-fi fanboy, you almost definitely know who J. J. Abrams is. And depending on where you fall in the spectrum between optimism and cynicism, you either hate him or love him already. With the keys to both Star Trek as well as Star Wars, Abrams definitely had a lot to stand up to. Well, with Star Trek Into Darkness, Abrams is already on strike one, at least in my book. Taking off from the 2009 Star Trek, which had a convenient changes in the series time-line to enable modification of certain elements, Into Darkness is mostly an insipid, long-winded and often pointless film, perhaps the only highlight being a certain Mr. Benedict who seems quite adept at, shall I say, Batch-slapping humans and Klingons alike. When a mysterious man carries out an attack on Starfleet headquarters and disappears into space, Captain James T. Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the crew are sent off on a mission to take him out. The mystery behind their new foe, however, deepens as Kirk and his crew are sucked further into a series of events they don’t understand.While the film never transgresses into unwatchable territory because of some of the cast, the action scenes and a number of inside jokes and references, (some of which I’m sure I missed because I’m more of a Star Wars fanboy myself,) the film has long stretches where it pretends to be a bit of a human drama about friendship and morals. That isn’t a bad thing by itself, but it tends to weigh this film down, because neither does it play the role of raising the tension and the stakes, nor does it particularly touch your heart. Bringing nothing new to the table in terms of plot or execution, the film continuously gives you a feeling of been-there-seen-that, which is so ironical considering the most recognizable line from the franchise is ‘boldly going where no man has gone before’. Even the so-called mystery in the plot is mostly predictable even if you have the bare minimum of knowledge about the series and haven’t read up much on this particular film.Not surprisingly, the main reason people were looking forward to this film – the mouth-watering prospect of Benedict Cumberbatch as villain – is the only thing that remains continuously interesting in the film. He has a searing, enigmatic, fierce presence which largely manages to live up to the expectations people had from him. Unfortunately, his presence in terms of screen time is far lesser than one would have hoped. Chris Pine as Kirk is the same, although he does seem to have grown into the role of Captain far more. Zachary Quinto as Spock is exactly how he was the last time around. Karl Urban, split between his two Star Trek appearances as McCoy and his deadpan turn as Judge Dredd last year, seems to have found some renewed vigour this time round.Abrams disappoints; there’s no two ways about that. Be it his control over craft or the narrative, he has quite clearly lost the plot. So much so that even great CG and decent 3D post-conversion doesn’t help the film rise above its heavily flawed and uninteresting screenplay. His usual love for lens flares, optical or digital, makes for a film that definitely looks good. But not good enough to justify spending all that time twiddling your thumbs, waiting for something to happen. J. J. Abrams has painted a big red target onto himself, and come 2015 when Star Wars Episode VII hits the silver screen, nearly every pair of eyes in the universe will be on him. And something tells me that no galaxy, however far away, will be safe for him if he messes up again!

So yes, it really has just nothing new to offer. Marginally watchable at best and completely avoidable at worst, only compulsive movie addicts should bother with this one.","Just how many times are we going to see an aging Nicolas Cage try and pull off what we are supposed to accept as righteously-motivated crimes, I do not know. But from the looks of it, he doesn't plan on stopping anytime soon. Stolen is precisely the kind of Hollywood film I dislike, except this film doesn't even really qualify as guilty fun, for more reasons than one can reasonably count.Will Montgomery (Cage) is a master thief; he and his team are in the middle of a heist worth $10 million when things go awry and Montgomery is the only one caught. Put away for the long haul, he gets out on parole after eight years. But the prison term has changed him. He now wants to put the 'wrong' life behind him. Life, however, has other plans for him.Director Simon West, whose filmography includes Con Air, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and The Expendable 2 amongst others, isn't a stranger to this kind of film - ones that depend on a fast pace and the star value to pull a film through, as opposed to a genuine plot. He has even found a moderate amount of success with them. However, Stolen gives such a sense of déjà vu throughout, that it really becomes hard to take it seriously. So much so that I was half expecting Cage to start spewing dialogue from National Treasure and Gone in 60 Seconds.Nearly everything about the movie - the story, the look, the dialogue, the background score - has a very generic, been-there-seen-that feel to it. The lines are often clumsy and silly, the plot twists are about as much of a surprise as yesterday's news and most of the performances, including the one by Josh Lucas, who plays the main antagonist, are downright laughable. The screenplay, if I can call it that, is one of convenience. There are far too many outlandish plot holes for it to have even a shred of credibility.To be fair, Nicolas Cage does try his best to rise above the mediocre script and soulless direction. He can do this kind of role in his sleep now, but that doesn't seem to stop him from giving it his all. Besides, let's face it - he is the kind of guy who you just cannot help rooting for. But the lack of attention to detail can be seen even in the manner in which his character is physically treated - when he leaves jail, he is haggard, has more than a hint of a grey stubble and just generally looks worn out. The rest of the film occurs within a 12-hour period of that, and yet his stubble seems to grow inwards rather than out. Little things perhaps, but they matter a lot if you are trying to create a world for the audience.If there is one thing that works in favour of the film, it is the run time. Thankfully clocking in at just a little over an hour and a half, the film runs fast and gets over without frustrating the audience too much. But that is honestly just the movie-loving, optimistic side of me speaking. When the audience is always a step ahead of the filmmaker, the film is doomed. Stolen suffers from exactly that, making it nothing more than forgettable.

Unfortunately, we get 2-3 extra minutes at each twist to predict the next move. And this mars what otherwise could have been a superb thriller.","An unsolved mystery in real life has so many potential climaxes. Our imagination is the only limitation. Writer-director Manish Gupta's imagination brings us his plausible solution to the unresolved case of the stoneman murders in the 80s and it's an interesting one too.

The wife, the colleague - could have been delved more into. We are allowed nowhere close to the killer's psyche. Then again, that might not be the point of the movie. Also the language used is extremely inconsistent and distracting. A character who speaks Hindi with a very heavy Bombay dialect suddenly spouts a phrase in chaste Hindi.  Most of the dialogue delivery is left in Kay Kay's safe hands and usually that's a good thing. He starts out as his usual exceptional self. It's a delight to see his composure change from attentive-submissive when he's with his boss to bossy-smug when ordering around his subordinates. And then suddenly it gets weird. He delivers his lines in a staged way which I just couldn't associate with him - the distant look in the eyes while mouthing some really bad lines. Rukhsar (Sanjay's wife) looks very out-of-place all through. Her attire - the way the cotton sari is draped and the way she's carrying it don't go together at all. Her character's sub-plot has no connection with the rest of the story. I have this creeping suspicion that she's here because she was the only one ready to shed her clothes for that one unnecessary scene and fit the budget!! You'd think that it's a thriller and has given itself only 95 minutes so they'd be in a rush. But, na-ah...the camera takes its time to scan the room and the characters. Usually, I enjoy slow camerawork, it gives me time to soak in the atmosphere but here it is very random and rather directionless. Not to mention, the typical thriller-violin-shrieking in the background. I'd have voted for a tighter screenplay. And since it's a short film in the first place, maybe a few minutes to delve into the psyche of the other characters would have made my experience more complete.

411,1111,1111,1111,1111,Stranger Than Fiction,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/stranger-fiction-review/,,,,3.75,"Stranger Than Fiction is a must watch for English Literature students. To begin with, it’s a wonderfully subtle attempt to discuss and play around the act of narration, writing and in fact, Being. How what we think as writers, or even as human beings, could be someone’s life out there or we could be living out someone’s mere thought. Add this to an interestingly charming amalgamation of characters and relationships and you’ll get Stranger Than Fiction.","I’ve often wondered whether writers know of the power they are bestowed with. As a bearer of fiction, you could make your characters dance around naked and pass it off as literary. It was fascinating to me, and I always wanted to write a book where I, the presumed author, would have a live conversation with my characters, talking to them about how they feel being part of the book. You know, almost like a really cool making of. Although, I guess Marc Forster beat me to it with Stranger Than Fiction. Stranger Than Fiction is one of those subtle movies that blow you away and you don’t even realize it. It’s revolves around Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), a meticulous auditor who leads a predictably disciplined life. Crick’s wrist watch is his life; timing every second of his day. The film grips you right in the beginning when, coupled with quirky graphics, we learn of how his head works. Numbers, road maps and calculations surround him as he plays out his life for us. With no background music to support his introduction, it’s one of the finest beginnings to a film you would witness. You’re then brought into the movie with a calm narration, only to realize that it’s a narration Crick can hear. His life turns upside down when he can hear a woman narrate his life for him (not to predict but almost as it happens to him). He consults a psychiatrist (Linda Hunt) who then refers him to a Literature professor, Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), to be able to help him with the text of the narration. To me, this entire sub-plot of the film is one of the most deductive interpretations of the consumption of literature (I’m including Charlie Kaufman’s Adaptation into this too). Hoffman deconstructs the text to the core – trying to analyze it’s genre by studying its archetypes; whether it’s a comedy or a tragedy (much like the film for us viewers – we are amused at the premise and tragically trying to ignore the existentialist question the film poses.)Interspersed with this is the story of Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a writer who doesn’t know how to put an end to her new novel. She’s sent an assistant to help her keep deadlines (Queen Latifah, whose so talented but extremely wasted and unnecessary in the film) – when she realizes, through the course of the film, the power of her story as she meets Harold. Harold also meets Ana Pascal, a motor-mouth, tattooed Bakery owner who hates his kind – “taxmen”. They develop an endearing relationship that starts with conflict and hate and moves onto a path of discovery. The growth of his relationship with Ana and his periodical meetings with Professor Hilbert brings the film together in a savory, indulgent manner. You are barely over this phenomenally understated premise – when you’re provided with the backdrop of edgy, charming characters and twisted relationships. Together they make Stranger Than Fiction an alluring film. The Blu-Ray edition of Stranger Than Fiction is packed with extras. The first and the most entertaining one is an audio commentary of Hoffman, Forster and Will Ferrell– it’s funny and goofy and provides a welcome breather to the stimulating movie. This attitude is present through the 6 featurettes that talk about the casting and making of the film. The disk also has 9 deleted scenes, mostly of Crick’s visits to the therapist. For die-hard fans of the movie (which I have now become after writing about it), it’s a DVD you must possess. Stranger Than Fiction is the kind of film that makes you realize how brilliantly crafted it is only as an afterthought. The kind that will make you go, “Wait a minute...” and you’ll rethink the film in your head. It’s in that process that you’ll want to butt into Crick’s narration, help him out, make your own deductions about the text, and suggest possible endings to Eiffel’s book. Most importantly, when you are slapped with the recurring existentialist question that this film is posing, you will not want to answer it but you’ll smile because the film hasn’t attempted to either.

412,1112,1112,1112,1112,Strangers,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewNotepad,/movie/strangers-review/,,,,3.75,Strangers has a smart plot and is played out very well by the lead actors. However the classy story-telling format takes away from the nitty-gritty of the characters and their motivations.,"Stories that don't have any characters that you can feel for are mighty difficult to narrate. And it is the narrative style here which though different is a bit overdone. So, while the plot refrains from spoon-feeding (thank you!), the leaps in the otherwise stylistic narration take away a bit of the crispiness. The non-linear narrative keeps you alert but gets in the way of character development. Which is why the gray characters seem distant. You can't sense their desperation. That none of the characters are wrong and no one is certainly all right is beautiful. But, before you begin to get the nuances of the character and sense their frustration, the narrative shifts to another time or place or both. This is very disorienting, especially towards the end.  Besides that however this technique of story-telling is used effectively to pique interest. The hard work that goes into the details of editing is apparent. Where exactly to cut from one sub-plot to the other is ever so important in such a movie. While these cuts worked at most times they seemed to have adversely effected the pacing towards the end. Strangers offers another great performance by Kay Kay Menon. And it is a pleasure to see Jimmy Shergill in a role that does his talent justice. It is to their credit that understanding what their characters were feeling, at any particular moment, needed no words. The relatively sparse dialogues are smart and at the very least cliché-free. The women on the other hand are not given enough room to showcase their capabilities. It seemed as if a lot less attention was paid to their roles and lines, which translated to lesser screen-time. It was nice to see use of handheld camera where it made sense, to create effect. E.g. in the train shots. Use of close-ups to bring focus to the expressions of the speaker at dramatic moments seemed purposeful and thus created the necessary impact. The lighting too was used tastefully. The decision to go the stylistic narrative route at a slow pace along with a 90 minute run-time has taken its toll on character development. An interesting plot loses steam because of the urge to do too many things in too little time. Parental Guidance: The basic concept of the movie is extra-marital affairs and the tone of the movie is very serious. However, there is no on-screen sexual or violent content.

The smart visuals are accompanied by jarring background music. The story is neither about carrom nor about the communal riots. The movie is neither here nor there.,"Rugged and raw - the slums of Mumbai are on display. There's also foreplay with time taking us back and forth and back. It's slick. And the drama escalates to invite curiosity. All good. Then, why the disarray? Because you wait and wait for something to happen and it doesn't. Or it happens, but is so sudden that it seems completely out of place. Maybe that's the reality that the filmmakers talk about. Or maybe that's how drama was supposed to build. But, here it doesn't.With a tagline that translates to ""the fittest survives"" you are constantly waiting for the film to peak. And the way the film is lit, shot, and edited, it holds promise. If the technicalities are good, there's hope that the story will catch up, right? Well, instead three and a half, different, promising threads take you nowhere. From the name and the publicity you look forward to a good board of carrom. While, you are thankful that there are no last-minute comebacks, there is nothing for you to root for or pray against. There aren't even good ricochet shots. And at the end of it you realize that the carrom in the film could have been easily replaced by any other skill Surya, (Siddharth), the protagonist has. Oh and that expected metaphor of life / system / protagonist being the striker is bleh, to say the least. You then look forward to the communal disharmony and the ""different"" angle that this particular story seems to have the potential for. Another hope brutally stoned to death. It's a mere backdrop not connected to the other limbs of the story. You can seek condolence in the fact that you realize this only towards the end, so the going is still alright. Also, meanwhile you see this lovely friendship between Surya and his bum-chum, Zaid (Ankur Vikal) germinating. Both in their own way, aspiring to do better for themselves. One taking everything seriously; the other relentlessly smiling through life. One taking as a straight a road as circumstantially possible; the other not-so-straight. One losing spirit; the other never willing to say die. One courageous enough to openly fight the biggest goon around; the other doing the same except by cheating the goon. Both actors play their characters mere functionally. And so does Anupam Kher, who's character, Inspector Farooq enters and exits the frame as per convenience only to represent the neutered law enforcement system. Even while he tells you that the most honest of police officers have to walk on a smalltime goon's corpse to get to the bigger fish, his role is very choppy and extremely disconnected. In this whole affair, the only actor who creates any kind of an impact is Aditya Pancholi as Jaleel. A whole lot of credit goes to his make-up artiste though. As the proceedings go on Surya's voiceover tries to create a link in these disjointed bits but works only as much as a voiceover can. Sure, this one worked for me only partially, but that the parts that worked is a sign of hope from this team because they have a skill set in the technical department as a starting point. Also, I feel the story-telling is not that much of an issue as the story itself. Well, there's always a next time.

But it does no justice to even one of them. It turned out to be pretty bad eventually but yet not as awful as I thought it'd be. ","Karan Johar tries to take a peek into the minds of the youth of today. While he does try to balance their dark and human sides, I'd still like to think there is more to our youth than the shollowness that goes with jealousy and excessive competitiveness. Even if there is an attempt to counter it with some large-heartedness and semblance of maturity every once in a while. Ultimately, the situations created are too fake to be credited with a connect to any generation's thought process.The uneven narrative makes it even more difficult to digest as a story. It's neither a fairy tale nor stems from reality for us to take it seriously. The build-up in the first 20 minutes towards an ominous event that occurred 10 years ago is trying to hard to get you interested. But various characters breaking the fourth wall and talking to you as an audience directly  is disconcerting and doesn't let you absorb the story. Between cinematic techniques, I wonder what is worse a voiceover or people talking to you through the screen, especially when it gets more than a couple of sentences. Anyway, through this medium you are introduced to Rohan (Varun Dhawan), Shanaya (Alia Bhatt) and Abhimanyu (Siddharth Malhotra)- supposedly 'stars' of the next generation. While their characters are a nice mix of black and white and raise a hope that if not profound or insightful, something mildly heart-warming and at least surprising might spring our way, A lot of credit for this hope goes to the actors. Not only do they look good, but they show glimpses of talent though it might yet to be fully exploited. It could also have to do with the fact that I thought all three of them would be mere show pieces. Student of the Year also tries to touch upon various themes. The impropriety of the stress laid on competitiveness and absolutely unacceptable parenting style being two of them. Another one that comes up is the status of people who are not-so-good-looking and not-so-rich. But these come in so abruptly and unexpectedly that they take you away from the basic love triangle brewing between the three main leads. The resolution of this love conflict itself is hardly explored, it is just stated as a fact. Ultimately, you can't help but feel that  the story tries to take in a lot more than it can chew.In addition, of course you have Karan Johar's standard  take on homosexuality. While Rishi Kapoor does grant it as much authenticity as he possibly can, I have always found Karan Johar's depiction more mocking than accepting. The songs do nothing but add to the length of the film. The choreography is lackluster, the tribute to songs and films from yesteryears via remixes don't make them any more watchable or bearable. And by the last song you just want it to be done with sooner rather than later. While I must admit that Student of the Year wasn't as bad as I expected, it still doesn't engage or have anything magnificently different to offer. The comments on the education or parenting system are to superficial to make any impact.

It’s a forgettable film, but I suggest you watch it on the big screen and then (forgive and) forget, than not watching it at all, or waiting for the DVD.","I think Zack Snyder makes a film, by reversing the traditional flow-chart - he first does post-production planning, followed by the shooting. At the end, he figures how to perfect that script from the graphic novel and identifies a story somewhere.Understandably, actors on his sets must be rarely challenged - all those cool and stylish effects, digital re-touching, mixing that so are typical of his films, that performances would be so boring. Imagine shooting bullets at imaginary objects, piercing the sword into non-existent creatures, being suspended from wires and surrounded by the chroma screen, all the time. Style over substance, therefore, is a trait of Snyder’s films. That still works to his advantage, since he never chooses to adapt Shakespeare on screen. Comics - a.k.a graphic novels - have rarely tried being about ‘substance’. Which is why, he’s possibly the best man alive, who can bring a graphic novel alive on screen. Sucker Punch confirms it - his command over technique and craft, such as sound design and mixing, cinematography, action choreography, editing, visual effects, make-up, is impeccable.Which is why, there’s so much visual and audio stimuli for a viewer to experience this film on the big screen. And it is therefore that I recommend, that if you want to form an honest opinion about this film - no matter how bad - you’ve got to head to your nearest multiplex. It would be criminal to experience Sucker Punch on DVD, or any screen shorter than the big screen.Sucker Punch isn’t half as good as his last outing, 300, which achieved cult following despite being panned by critics. The adaptation isn’t bad, it’s just that the story falls flat. Moreover, this Charlie’s Angels-meets-Matrix, fantasy action thriller has an overdose of blondes. The storyline is simple - the lead protagonist, helpless Babydoll (Emily Browning) is sent to a mental asylum by her evil stepfather where she retreats into a fantasy-filled escape plan, by finding a set of clues.Since it’s HER fantasy, she is magically rewarded with samurai-like sword fighting skills as well as powers to float around at her own choice of gravitational force, before slaughtering dragons and other video-game essentials. Joining her on this escape mission, are a few other pretty young things (PYTs) - Sweet Pea (Abby Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung).The plot defies logic and any bit of thought or morals that the script tries to pontificate is absolutely absurd and I didn’t get any of it. You shouldn’t try to either - if you’re looking for a take-away from a film, bad idea.I however did enjoy Snyder’s treatment of action sequences, the special effects and all the jazz that has come to characterise his films - the rich color tones, soundtrack laden with rock music, the slow motion fight sequences and the gore. The soundtrack, in fact does immense charity to helping improve the viewing experience.Amongst the women, Jena Malone (who played Carine McCandless in Into The Wild) and Abby Cornish are good, but Emily Browning proves to be a major disappointment. I got introduced to her - especially her sexy pout - in Lemony Snickett’s A Series of Unfortunate Events, and although she fires bullets and punches the baddies pretty well, that blonde hairdo and ponytails makes her appear too dumb. Oscar Isaac’s performance as Blue Jones, the evil pimp to all these women, is noteworthy.Sucker Punch falls into that category of films which advise you to leave your brains at home. Simple as it may sound as a suggestion, it is an incredibly difficult anatomical feat to pull off. Our brains and heart better be together. Why not then, Mr Scriptwriter, do you do us a favour by working a little harder.

Beautifully acted, with some crackling lines, it's the kind of bug you won't mind being bitten by.","There's a breed among us, (numbering at least a few thousands, but who can ever know?) for whom Sulemani Keeda will resonate more than it will with anyone else - those aspiring writers in Mumbai, who dream of having their words traverse the journey from paper to celluloid (or, you know, DCP files, as is the case today).It is a tough life, that of an aspiring film-maker in Bombay, or anywhere in the world. The struggle of someone who wants to be behind the camera is surpassed only by that of one who wishes to make his name in front of it. This struggle has its share of humour as well, but that's mostly because writers are a lot who don't mind looking at the funnier side of life, even when looking at it soaring above one's head from the bottom of a pit.Amit Masurkar's film, about the lives of a screenwriter pair who dream of cracking that one script that will turn their fortunes around, is a film laced with humour, insight and a level of honesty that's hard to find. Despite the fact that certain people are bound to identify with the film more than the others, it is also a film that will connect with anyone; because every story, even one about writers, has its basis somewhere in real life.In fact, the film is quite like that popular meme which visually lists out situations like how the world sees you, how your parents see you, how you see yourself and how you actually are. It is a tiny little slice out of the journey between where one is, and where one wants to be. The journey may be fraught with disappointment and failure, but we're still at it.  Our 'heroes', (though they're anything but,) are named Mainak and Dulal. Yes, they're writing a film for a big Khan. The only hitch is that they're yet to meet him. It is the little touches like these that lend a sense of comic irony to the film.Mainak is street smart and is more likely to write the kind of lines one hears in a Dabangg. Dulal, on the other hand, is an idealist, a poet, a nomad at heart. When he falls in love, he goes the whole hog. And when his heart breaks - well, I'd leave it to you to figure out what happens when a writer's heart breaks.What is most heart-warming about Sulemani Keeda is the fact that without being emphatic and jingoistic about it, it subtly subverts so many clichés that we've come to expect from a romantic comedy. The process of meeting, attraction, realizing the presence of an emotional and intellectual connect - all of it seems so much more genuine. (A big reason for this is the cast, but I'll get to that in a bit.)Even the done-to-death airport climax is dumped in favour of a sequence that's most likely how it'll be, if it were to happen in real life. Kudos, also, to the film-makers for the character of Ruma, the kind of woman you're more likely to run into in middle class Bombay than any other woman you've seen on screen. Mayank Tewari and Naveen Kasturia, who play Mainak and Dulal respectively, perform like there's no camera, as though they are Mainak and Dulal. Cinematic characters usually spend more relative time worrying about morality than real people. Director Masurkar gets it bang on, the way he treats these characters and their moral dilemmas. Mainak comes across as a likeable creep, and Dulal as the bumbling romantic. They're real people, these two, even if they're probably an amalgam of a bunch of them. Aditi Vasudeo, who plays Ruma, is an absolute natural.Admittedly, the film doesn't age as well as one would have hoped. I first watched this film over a year ago at the Mumbai Film Festival, and it seemed so much less like a low budget indie back then. In fact, it is apparent just how much of 'jugaad' - getting things done by hook or by crook - has gone into this film. Yet, that's also the beauty of it. In it's message as well as in the manner in which it was made, it is a film that inspires you to undertake the journey you seek. For only then will you have been a story.

","Sully is what you get when Clint Eastwood’s methodical erudition for real life stories (American Sniper, J.Edgar, Invictus) meets Tom Hanks’ inexhaustible sagacity to essay oddball, eponymous characters (Forrest Gump, Cast Away, Captain Phillips).  Sully is also what you get when a screenplay wrought in constant simmering tension meets a near flawless re-staging and recreation of the ‘miracle on the Hudson' - the epithet that has since been given to the events that unfolded, on an otherwise pedestrian wintry New York morning in ’09, aboard US Airways flight 1549. At a run-time of 96 minutes, there isn’t an amber of a moment that could have been sliced or spliced. You have a frequent, unmistakable feeling of literally being on that near ill-fated flight. The PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) felt by the crew hits home too at a visceral level.Also remarkable is the fact that for an event that lasted all of 208 seconds end- to-end, the revealing of what went before and especially what came after lends the film a thriller garb. It is as riveting as it is stirring. As Captain Sullenberger, Hanks is utterly believable and is everything that you expect him to be – self-effacing, guilt-ridden, conflicted, noble – and his natural restraint offsets the mildly hagiographic tint that Eastwood embellishes on his protagonist.For Hanks aficionados, there is much to look forward to – the gravitas, the grimace and yes, the grace. Aaron Eckhart, as first officer Jeffrey Skiles, provides timely comic relief. He has a palpable chemistry with Hanks.In the aftermath of the miracle, the real life Sullenberger famously said that he had made many small, regular deposits in the bank of experience, education and training over 40 years. And that on 15th of January’09, the balance was enough for him to make one very large withdrawal.  The same, I wonder, can be said of both Hanks and Eastwood in the light of their combined, often affecting, oeuvre on display.

Both are equally predictable and melodramatic.,"The good news is that the film is not your standard Salman Khan film that asks you to leave your brain behind. The not-so-good news is that it is still a predictable, melodramatic affair. The bad news is that the plot repeats itself twice over. It seems like telling it once didn't take it to optimum runtime, so the writers decided to say it all over again. In turn, this one ended up being almost 3 hours long. With nothing new to tell it is interesting that the second half is more engaging than the first. It could have to do with a fresh set of action choreography in terms of the wrestling matches. Despite being a sports film, at its heart Sultan is romantic. But it is very conscious about being romantic. So, a boy woos a girl - twice. Each time, the boy is willing to go to any extent to win her love but of course he is too macho to accept it. Instead he calls it a fight with himself. eyeroll That and dialogue you would find in any coach-prodigy film like, “I see myself in you.” make Sultan even more predictable.The only surprises then, can come from individual situations or performances. Individual situations try hard to seem progressive in the form of the lead lady giving a lecture on a woman's rightful place in this new age. Unfortunately, it cannot hold its own for too long and falls prey to putting the man on a pedestal despite his faults. So be it. Anyway, so is it in real life. With a pinch of salt, we can applaud a Salman Khan film to be close to reality. It also nods its head to reality by acknowledging that it is rife with melodrama. That still doesn't make the melodrama any more tolerable. Interestingly though, the performances do their best in keeping the melodrama at bay. There are no histrionics and minimal hamming from lead actors Salman Khan and Anushka Sharma. Supporting acts by one and all are pretty good too. Though each one of them slips in their accent and it looks particularly unnatural coming from Anushka Sharma. Even so, Sultan doesn't get boring. The music is engaging, the visuals are crisp and fight sequences from the second half arrest your attention while they last. They take the edge off the flat plot, yet not a whole lot.

But, just like we read about it in the newspapers, write about it on our blogs, we should watch this movie because someone dared to make it.","The movie opens with a man standing in the middle of a lush green farm. And when you realize he is going to commit suicide, the contrast between the rich field and the poor man hits you like a bolt. No people, this is not a spoiler, it's a true life story. It's the story of over 150000 farmers who've killed themselves. We've already read about it in the newspapers. But now that we have a visual it will stay with us for a while.Another contrast strikes when this scene cuts to three men behaving like boys. Arrogant and ""kewl"", Carefree and irresponsible, wannabe and dependent (Sikandar, Arjan Bajwa, and Alekh Sangal). Yes, the characters of the three friends are defined in these 5 minutes. Similarly, the two lead women, one an epitome of all things motherly, the other almost the exact opposite are etched out for us in the next 10 minutes (Gul Panag and Uvika Choudhary). Later, when we are introduced to the village doctor (Ashutosh Rana) too, we can sense how despite his helplessness, he's trying to help in the best possible manner. Most of the credit for these clear definitions goes to the writing. The casual and aptly light lines in the beginning are of course done justice to by their delivery. But, somehow, there is a heavy tinge of artificiality in the performances except for those by Gul and Ashutosh. Gul is the cute momly figure we love to annoy and has a breathtakingly well-performed scene in the last half hour. Ashutosh Rana's performance shows a new facet of his talent. It is refreshing to see him in a non-villainous, soft role. Again kudos to some well-written scenes. The transformation of these city based, hip, largely insensitive youngsters into working towards to a cause happens gradually and not ungrudgingly. However, all's not well as far as writing is concerned too. Uvika's and Alekh's roles are underwritten and lack depth after the initial exposition. Their motivations are not clear and because of that, I got the feel that maybe the movie could've done without them. Also the movie could have saved precious 20 odd minutes by keeping the absolutely dispensable songs out - both in terms of the music itself, and the way they are picturised. I could also make observations about things like Sikandar's cringed nose and squinted eyes. But, I would then lose focus on what the movie is trying to aim at. One would be absolutely right to say that none of the departments of film-making seem to have been delved into 100% - be it writing, acting, or other technical aspects like camerawork or editing. But, full marks at attempting to describe the complex issues involved in the farmer suicides. Yes, there are a whole load of sub-plots, but each one shows a different link in the chain of events that leads to the ultimate breakdown of the farmer who grows us our daily rice and dal (lentil curry). At many points in the movie, I was wondering why is this movie being targeted towards the multiplex audience when the issues they are trying to resolve are situated in a land far, far away. And that is THE point. It is aimed towards me and you, browsing the net looking for reviews of the latest release. It is to sensitize us to what's happening out there or rather in there, in the interiors of the country. It doesn't offer any earth-shattering, practical solutions. In fact it alludes to the fact that we are intelligent people out here. Why don't we do something? What? How? When? That's for us to figure out. They have given us the why. Maybe one of the solutions is to have us do rural training as a part of our education - why only medical students? Engineers, managers, accountants, artists can contribute too. Is it that farfetched? It's not that impossible to reach out to our sensitivity, is it? Of course, the going is hardly going to be easy. The most righteous of us will be wronged, but the most unsympathetic can also be made human.I am thrilled. Thrilled that new things are being tried in Hindi cinema. Be it, the narrative style in Aamir or the most abstract use of metaphor in No Smoking or a theme that moviemakers wouldn't dare touch with a yardstick like in Summer 2007. All of them have commercial doom written all over them. And not just because of the way they are made, but I'm sure even on paper, the people involved knew very well that it's not going to make moolah. But, it is their urge to tell their story that brings these stories to us. Of course, I would be even more thrilled if Aamir and Summer 2007 did well at the box office. But I'm glad that the unlikelihood of financial success didn't keep the movies from being made. And at the very least Summer 2007 serves as documentation of how things were in India in the '00s and how we reacted to them.

Instead we have a loud, garish product. A few good laughs 
Make it a lazy Sunday watch, if at all.","Why is subtlety so underrated? Sunday could have been so much more had it been a little less zealous about showing itself off - by misusing the music, giving the colors an extra-shine, and the overall video-album like tone of the movie. The basic premise is not bad at all, and the writers manage to squeeze in a social message too. However, the 'whodunit' script can't escape the usual suspects - the never-ending chase, the ill-placed songs, and the stretch-till-after-it-breaks rubber-band climax. Keep in mind that I am trying my best to overlook the improbable situations, the continuity lapses, and the glaring loopholes. After all, it’s a senseless comedy which is at least making an attempt at sense. Got to give credit where it's due.What makes Sunday worth a lazy Sunday afternoon watch is its sense of humor. It ranges from mundane to tongue-in-cheek to witty to hilarious. And the lines are carried off well by the cast - from the top (Ajay Devgan) to the supporting cast (Vrajesh Hirjee). Most of the characters have individual characteristics which help the audience identify them. This is in contrast to characters from other such movies where any character could be replaced by the other. It’s the other technical aspects which pull down the movie to very low levels. The background score is truly overwhelming and at times completely taking on the workload of all the action - the comedy, the drama, the fight sequences. In all likelihood this was a purposeful decision, but I think the humor would have been better supported if the background music stayed in the background, instead of being in the face and making sure you notice how many songs from yesteryears the makers know. The camera angles were all over the place and the cuts too many - which can be called stylish if you are watching a 5-minute song on MTV, but not so if it is a 2+ hour movie and you are watching it on the big screen. Also, the decisions of when to use black-and-white and when to bleach the reel seemed rather random. However, some of the transitions were interesting and creatively executed.One thing that can be surely said about the songs when you have two item numbers is that they are going to be arbitrarily placed. And Tusshar Kapoor for an item number - now that's what I call creative! Music and lyrics are something that you wouldn't remember a couple of minutes after they are over. I see Sunday as something that could have been much better. Especially, considering it had decent dialogues - an essential for comedies - and an adequate cast to pull it off.

This subtly satirical documentary is engaging and entertaining. A must watch for sure, in theaters if you are keen. ","Malegaon ka Superman - the title sounded funny the first time I heard it, the kind of funny one should avoid. Yet it was intriguing, having known of the little village and a few people from it - those who have suffered the communal riots mentioned in passing in this documentary. What we see is not the film itself, but it's making - a film about the supermen of Malegaon who tried making Malegaon ka Superman. And I haven't seen anything as heart-warming in a really long time.Supermen of Malegaon is soaked in sweet irony. You blink and you might miss one. And it all done without being overt or direct. The simplicity and subtlety with which things are talked about and issues are covered is remarkable - from the intentional mockery of film-making in India to the hypocrisy that a film-maker exhibits in keeping his brother from making a career out of making films.In fact, this making of Malegaon ka Superhero is an advanced lesson on jugaad. The number of innovative fixes to overcome the budget issues while making the film or simple lack of knowledge is just amazing. And these are just the fixes that the documentary decided to focus on. That doesn't mean that we'll like Malegaon ka Superman. But just the number of hilarious things they have Superman do or the characteristics this most unlikely Superman (played by Late Shafique) has might be enough for the ticket money. That besides, how can you not encourage such enterprising filmmakers?Who would've thought we'd be watching a documentary, the making of an almost-no-budget (in today's times) film in  mainstream theaters.

Doesn't thrill and leaves huge loopholes.,"The palpating thriller “feel” is missing from the word go, but it takes a while to register that nothing really has happened in the first half hour. A huge reason could be that you are expecting something to happen as an effect of the trailer. You adjust yourself to the sombre tone and the low lighting of the film bracing yourself for a gripping drama. But, it doesn't really come through.Even though TE3N takes its sweet time to actually get things rolling, you have an indomitable Amitabh Bachchan playing the subdued, helpless yet determined John. While Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Vidya Balan  (in a large-ish guest appearance) have nothing spectacular to do in terms of presenting their skills, their presence is reassuring. Reassuring that if nothing else, we know we won't have to suffer bad acting. That comes in the form of Sabyaschi Chakraborty. He is absolutely unconvincing. Once you have gotten used to the actors and the characters they perform, you wait for the story to kick in. And kick in it does. Only it comes with its share of huge loopholes. Of course, I can't discuss those here. These are questions that come as the story moves along which you are very sure will remain unanswered but are hoping not. Unfortunately, almost all possibilities you can think of as answers are implausible and don't fit in. The one trick they pull is pretty neat but the details are rather dull. The 'how' of 'what' happened seems uneven. As in bits are explained in much detail and other bits are just glossed over. Meanwhile, there is a lot of repetition of dialogue and situations for some 10-15 minutes of the second half. Precious time lost in a thriller. And then to wrap it up, TE3N does what annoys me most about thrillers – has some character narrate the whole sequence of events and over-explains.The tricks then seem pointless because the basics seem to be off. Along with the writing then, the other departments, the dark mood created by the lighting, the music wanting to take a lead on providing thrills - all seem a little too deliberate and thus forced. I don't quite like using the word “disappointing” for films. It has a trail of expectations attached to it. As if you had very high expectations and then were let down. The way TE3N turned out, it would've been an underwhelming experience even if I wasn't looking forward to it.

But, it does manage to tell a regular story in a style that warms the heart. Thinking about the movie two hours after having left the theater, the first thing that comes to mind is the car races. They are timed well and executed even better. However, I would have liked more aerial shots and fewer close-ups. Who wants to see a sweaty Saif Ali Khan? Only the face shows through a helmet, gals! The races and broad story-line did remind me a lot of Naya Daur (1957), Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander (1992), Cars (2006).The next thing that comes to mind are the two cutely picturised songs. ""Ab to forever"" didn't necessarily have the most complicated dance moves, but structured choreography interspersed with normal dancing made it a delight to watch. ""tara ra rum pum, ta ra rum pum"" is by far the best picturised kids' song after ""akdam bakdam"" from Hanuman (2005). The lyrics in general, and specifically of ""Saiyaan"", restore my faith in Jaaved saahab after the Namastey London (2007) debacle.  Which leaves us with the two romantic tracks. Those are reminiscent of songs from the late 80s-early 90s and thus didn't quite fit in with the rest of the movie. Were the songs required, you ask? Have you seen the promos, dear? No? The newspaper ads with the producer's name on it? Okay-you at least know the title of the movie, right? Then, what kind of a question is that!? I seriously think the movie was named as such because they came up with that kids' song first.
They did not even bother to use the perfectly valid excuse they had - Rani Mukherjee plays a singer. We have seen Rani Mukherjee have marital tiffs with Vivek Oberoi (Saathiya (2002)), Shah Rukh Khan (Chalte Chalte (2003)), Abhishek Bachchan (Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006)). Now it is Saif Ali Khan's turn. It's pretty much the same Rani here. The same Rani that makes you shut your ears when she shrieks while playing a 20 year old and warms your heart when she plays her age. Again, Saif Ali Khan does nothing path-breaking. But he sticks to the genre and doesn't go overboard.  The children give an endearing performance. At times though, Angelina Idnani (Princess) was given dialogues that were too mature for her. The voiceover especially was certainly overkill. Their characters and situation looked like it was heavily drawn from Itni Si Baat (1981), Life Is Beatiful (1997).  Someone I would have loved to see more of, would be Jaaved Jaaferi. Why wasn't he allowed to shake a leg or two? At least they gave him the best lines that he delivered with his ""Videocon Flashback"" style. Everything was just about average, acting, direction, screenplay, story, editing (it could very well have been cut short by a good 15-20 minutes). But, while I scoffed every time I was asked to suspend my disbeliefs, the scene was accompanied by a shade of creativity that kept me entertained. And gradually, without realizing it, I was rooting for R V (Saif) and didn't care how many cinematic liberties the director would have to take to make this end happily ever after. So, somewhere along the line the characters and plot touched a soft spot and I didn't want bad things to happen to them. Whether it is indeed a feel good movie or not you will have to check out for yourself. I would wait for the video if I didn't have to review this one. But if you are in the mood for well-shot car races and sweetly picturised songs, don't miss it in the theaters, and take the kids along.Correction: Earlier I mentioned ""Shakalaka Boom Boom"" instead of ""Namastey London"" in the third paragraph. Indeed, the lyrics of Shakalaka Boom Boom are written by Sameer. Thanks, Charles Foster Kane aka Antonio Ricci, for pointing it out. Apologies readers!

The ""Something ought to be wrong, I just don't know what."" turns into a regular twist in the tale without throwing you off balance. The social message shoved down your throat in the end doesn't help the film's cause either.","A married couple, very much in love with each other, is pulled into playing a online reality game along the lines of The Moment of Truth. Interestingly enough, the Indian version of the game, Sacch Ka Saamna was hosted by the hero of Table No 21's, Rajeev Khandelwal. Anyway, the idea, of a couple having to complete a task related to the question just answered - a truth and dare of sorts - is very engaging. Unfortunately, it all ends up being very much as expected and is topped off with a social message.My concern with films with social message is that an audience like me needs no convincing. I'm already on the story-teller's side of the issue. The people who need to watch the film are the one's who commit the crime. And even if they were to watch a film like this, would that make a difference in their behavior. Even powerful films might not have that effect, and Table No 21 isn't even hard-hitting enough. So, what's the point? Sorry, talking about the kind of crime in question would be giving the movie away.Table No 21 doesn't come off as strong enough, despite some grueling stuff that the protagonists/antagonists go through, because you don't quite connect with the characters. You know they are grey and that's a brilliant thing in today's world of black and white characters in Hindi films. Yet, you don't feel for them even when they are going through some of the most mentally cruel ordeals. Their happiness and sorrow seems fake.Some of the disconnect also seems to be because of the order in which the tasks pan out. Instead of escalating into more rigorous and painful ones. So after having gone through a major ordeal the couple's dilemma seems fake when there is a relatively simpler one comes after that. Sure, some of them are more symbolic tortures than others, yet the symbolic pain seems artificial. That in turn, could be because of some very functional performances by Rajeev Khandelwal and Tena Desae. Paresh Rawal trying to be his devilish best, doesn't help. Paresh Rawal's character's sidekick provides unintentional laughter while trying to look all ominous.So, yet another potentially interesting story falls prey to mediocre execution. Yet another topic of concern in the country sees a film that is made with all the right intentions and a lot of heart, but comes across as contrived and forced.

Yet barring the discontent sensed by the climax, the other 115 minutes were well spent.","I completely relished the sweet time taken to establish little Tahaan's innocence and his harsh environment. I got fairly involved with the conflict gradually created because he's surrounded by people taking advantage of an 8-year old's gullibility. All this build-up towards a 5-minute climax? So sudden was the en, that people who might've fallen asleep because of the slow pace thus far, might even miss the climax.Yet, it didn't take anything away from a heart-warming performance by Purav Bhandare (Tahaan). The earnestness in his eyes in combination with his character's zeal was inescapable. I've become so used to seeing Anupam Kher in loud comedies, that any non-slapstick from him seems like a huge step in the right direction. So, though not his best, it's certainly one that makes most of the voice modulation he's capable of. This is the first time I've seen Rahul Bose play a non-city-bred character. In fact, he plays a village fool, if not the village fool. I'm still debating whether it's more because of how we are conditioned to see him that he doesn't seem convincing or it is indeed a role that he couldn't carry. Any which way, both the actor and the director need to be complimented for the experimentation. Sarika's grief-stricken eyes left me completely awestruck.And so did the cinematography. Kashmir's Pahalgam - the first time I saw snow and fell in love with it. Looks as beautiful now, as it was then. Only the houses look more rundown, the people seem poorer but have done their best to maintain the warmth inside. I guess visitors have to think twice before they can consider a vacation in Kashmir, where children play military-terrorist with their broken cricket bats. It might be fiction; it might be based on non-fictional situations. Either way, it's believable. Is it so easy to plant bombs? Or is this the film-maker's way of telling the people of Kashmir, ""look at what you're doing to our children"" So, what do I give more weightage to - my disappointment with how the story loses its way or the beautiful photography? Why does it seem like the cinematographer Santosh Sivan took over the reigns from the writer Santosh Sivan? But, director Santosh Sivan seems to have done well with the actors, folk-based background score, art work, styling, and photography, of course. Was the aim to show the condition of Kashmir or to narrate the story of a brave boy? Maybe one through the other. Full points to the former and more than a little dissatisfaction with the latter. I'd give that extra point because the serenity of this one can only be enjoyed on the big screen.

426,1126,1126,1126,1126,Taken,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/taken-review/,,,,4.066666667,"A film which is now a favourite at DVD rental stores, Taken is a done to death story made into a very good action thriller where Liam Neeson, a former CIA agent goes on a rampage to retrieve his kidnapped daughter. Bone cracking action, splendid car chases and a rather interesting location to shoot a crime drama - Paris. By being thoroughly enjoyable while it lasts, this is escapist Hollywood fare which is believable. I saw this film after strong recommendations from my peers. They’re absolutely right.","If you are an avid film buff, you wouldn’t buy or rent Taken’s DVD just by looking at its cover. It has a cryptic picture of Liam Neeson and a very blah line: “I don’t know who you are, but if you don’t let my daughter go, I will find you and kill you.” Deja vu? Precisely my point. It’s a very seen-that-heard-about premise: daughter gets kidnapped, daddy has to run all over the park to find her back. No wonder when it released, despite positive reviews, the film had a very poor start at the box-office. Nevertheless, thanks to word-of-mouth publicity, it achieved some level of success on DVD.That’s more or less how I chanced upon the film - it’s theatrical release was a blink-and-miss. But strong recommendations from friends were forthcoming. I’m never been much of a Liam Neeson fan but this film has made me one. It’s clear that he’s a casting agent’s delight as far as thrillers are considered. And looking back, I’d probably have cast him in the film adaptations of the Dan Brown novels (The Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons.)Taken is pretty much what the DVD cover says it to be - Bryan Mills (Neeson), a father separated from his daughter and wife, will do everything he can to get her back when she gets kidnapped on an overseas holiday in France, with her girlfriend. There’s a catch here: the kidnappers do not want any ransom.The film is racy, full of action, and wastes no time in verbosity. Mills is a former CIA agent and his pursuit of the kidnappers is fraught with little obstacles. On a lighter note, I wondered if the film-makers are suggesting that to nail down criminals, the world may not produce an Iron Man or Batman, but someone with an extensive career behind him in the CIA is equipped with all necessary skills - investigative, medical, physical and even flirtatious - to conquer all odds.I was most impressed with how the screenplay trimmed each scene just at the right time. The fights are extremely well-shot. As a viewer, if you feel your arms getting a gentle involuntary jerk to punch the villians on screen, it is clear that the film has got your complete attention in a hypnotic way. Another good reason why you may like Taken, and even empathise, or even get frightened by the context of the kidnapping is the manner in which it unfolds. I won’t be surprised if you remember Taken when you’re travelling to a new city and mull over a request from a stranger to share a taxi ride. There’s a message somewhere. As a Facebook and Twitter civilisation, we’re witnessing the decline of barriers in trusting people. Taken doesn’t sermonise on this issue - it rather portrays this tension through Mills’ character who is shown to be a rather worrisome father. As a former CIA agent, he cannot trust people easily - he’s seen too much of the ugly side of governments, rebellious groups and white collar criminals. I’m glad the film-maker kept film free of any such monologues. Though, the ending was a little incomplete. By the way it concluded, it felt like the ending of a ‘Father’s Day’ film.The true heroes of Taken are its direction and screenplay. Director Pierre Morel, known best as a cinematographer makes a formidable team with his writers Luc Besson (the Transporter series, the La Femme Nikita television series) and Robert Mark Kamen (the Karate Kid series, Gladiator, The Fifth Element) to put together a film that’s an edge-of-the-seat thriller in the true sense.You need not prepare to watch this film. Just eject the DVD tray, load the film, get some popcorn and enjoy.

427,1127,1127,1127,1127,Talaash,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma reviewNotepadPreview54 Critic Reviews 4.3/5.0 5 Reader Reviews 3/5.0 187 Tweet Reviews 3.4/5.0,/movie/talaash-review/,4.3/5.0,3/5.0,3.4/5.0,3.566666667,Talaash is more an emotional drama than a thriller. This mixing of genre works but only towards the climax. Through the first half though I found myself pushing myself to like the film. It stays at 'just a good film' when it could've been so much more.,"Talaash springs in a surprise. Not in a thriller sort-of a way. But by being more about its characters than the overall story. You don't really expect a film about a mysterious accident to be much more about how deeply damaged the protagonists are and how each one is trying to bring peace to the soul within. Given that, you still come out feeling you didn't know the characters well enough. Talaash leans too heavily on the typical assumptions you are going to make about characters given their situations. A stern police officer who has lost a dear one will behave in a particular manner. A mourning young mother is  forlorn. It gives you this much in the first few minutes and adds no more. And a lot of what goes on in the story that these characters weave together is known from the promos itself. Yet again, the promos, and overall marketing in general, of a film takes expectations in a different direction, a direction that is detrimental to the film. It is sort-of cheating calling Talaash a thriller or even a psychological thriller. For want of a better phrase let me coin 'emotional thriller' which seems to fit the bill better. Had the trailers and synopsis hinted towards the heavy emotional bent to the film, I wouldn't have spent the first half looking for the thrill. And once again, I realise how little weight the pre-release material of a film deserves. Lesson learnt.Anyways, once I figured that Talaash isn't really going to bring the thrill in a hurry, I settled down to the pace of the film. Slowly, the pace grows on you even though the story it unfolds never ever really grips you from the core. This is mainly due to the many threads opened in the first half. Is it about the accident/murder? Is it about a police officer's personal trauma? Is it about his wife's mental health? Is it about the prostitutes and their palpable conditions? Is it about an enigmatic prostitute? Well, it ends up being about all of them, but the pieces don't come together seamlessly. Also, it constantly felt like they wanted to keep things subtle but got scared into spelling things out, just in case the audience doesn't 'get it'. I do understand, a thriller needs to send its audience off in many directions to keep them distracted from what's really happening. But, the weightage each of these threads gets in the first half, does injustice to all of them. None of the sub-plots take you deeper into the characters or their situations. They all stay at a superficial level. What actually keeps you going are the performances. For a change, Aamir Khan is more Surjan Shekhawat than Aamir Khan. The only times I was reminded of the star was when he addressed his superior who looked younger than him as 'Sir'. It just felt off. To director, Reema Kagti's credit, the film is not overwhelmed by his presence. Or that of Kareena Kapoor's. She plays the teasing prostitute who has a mysterious aura about her with elegance. Rani Mukerji has a short but powerful presence. On the other hand, Raj Kumar Yadav and Nawazuddin Siddiqui entertain and create intrigue respectively. I still would prefer seeing them in films that are more about their characters.And as far as the twist in the tale goes, you can make a fair guess from the promos, a guess that is confirmed about 20 minutes into the second half. But it is pretty cool that you are still a little away from the whole truth. What I found amusing is that had this been a non-Indian film, the 'whole truth' would have been apparent a lot earlier. Now before I relent to the temptation of naming one particular psychological thriller from Hollywood that will give the movie away, let me move away from the twist. Yet, this is what won me over. I have always enjoyed stories that have a climax that gives the film more meaning than what it seemed about. In clarification, many films lose the plot in the last half hour and take away everything that they had build up till then. Whereas Talaash takes the entire goose chase to a deeper level. A level I hadn't seen coming mainly because I didn't think I'd see it in a Hindi film. I'm so used to disconnected dots staying so in films we generate. Unfortunately, the chase is rendered pretty much pointless, because it is not about the apparent chase at all. Talaash is a game of hide-and-seek that characters play with themselves. It is more an emotional tale of a police officer, a responsible father's need for catharsis, about the closure he deserves. Which is why, it seems like a film that could have meant so much more. That could have connected so much more deeply than just having a funky climax, that uses voice-overs of scenes we saw earlier to spoon-feed us.Also, doesn't a film talking about such philosophical, psychological and emotional stuff need much more profound and powerful dialogue? All this one has is dialogue that are too obviously metaphorical. So, despite performances that make stars look like humans, despite some awesome production design and camera-work, despite having potential to play tricks on the mind that the audience would enjoy figuring out, despite being more than what is obvious, Talaash remains just a good film.

Why should you watch it then? Because we shouldn't turn a blind eye to the system we live in, even if the system itself is so.","Did a father murder his daughter with her mother as an accomplice? A deep chill runs down the spine irrespective of the answer. If yes, it means a person who belongs to the same economic and educational strata as ours can commit such a heinous crime. If no, it implies they are mourning in a jail – both the death of their daughter and their baffling misfortune. That the film leaves you thinking about the characters involved in itself is proof that it did justice to the case, whether or justice was done in the case. It is not that we don't know what humans are capable of. In fact, nothing I hear in the news shocks me any more. I am sure, often enough, we can find a news item which had we seen in a film, we would have scoffed a, “that cannot happen in real life”. If women can be raped by order of a governing body – quasi and unelected as it may be - for her brother's fault/crime, anything can happen. If a father can kill a daughter for not making food the shape he likes it, anything can happen. And of course, the Arushi double-murder case is anything but unheard of. Having desensitized myself so, I feel more capable of handling the ruthlessness of the true life world that this movie is about to unfold. With my sketicism of what is reported by media, I hadn't followed the case back then, in too much detail. I decided, as always, to not research too much before watching the film. It let's me watch a film such as this like a film and not give in to real-life drama. All well-intentioned attempt at balance aside, the film draws you in. At first, the events seem episodic; the back-and-forth and point-of-view repetition seems like a cinematic gimmick (of course, Rashomon-usque. But then, you get drawn in and you only wonder how many episodes they must've had to leave out to stick to the 2-hour time limit. The casting is flawless – and regular readers would know, I don't use blanket statements easily. Gajraj Rao's pace and ineptitude gets on your nerves, quite like the frustration that the Tandons must've felt too. Irrfan Khan completely owns it. Is there a better poker face around? Can anyone else carry dark humor with such impeccable timing like this man? Konkona Sen Sharma and Neeraj Kabi couldn't have merged into the background any better. The film is about them and yet, they are mere backdrop. That's what their personalities seemed like – staying out of limelight; keeping to themselves. In fact, the more showy Kanhaiya played by Sumit Gulati aptly stays in memory longer. A lot of these performances come from very well-thought out writing. The documentation available on this case is vast. To sift through that and decide on points to focus on might not have been an easy task. For example, the decision to include the investigating officer's personal life, which was completely extraneous to the case, must have been a well-considered one. One that keeps the audience rooted in reel life. Usually, such an inclusion feels like an intrusion. But, here it goes with the flow of the film and shows you a facet of the officer that you might not have known to even have thought of. Once these decisions were made, you can see the effort put into fine-tuning them into a coherent, in its own way linear story, to arrive at the desired effect - make a case from the writer-director point of view. Sure, it is not an unbiased point of view. And that makes you unsure about the film. It bothers you that the conclusion is dissatisfactory. And you realise, that is because it is dissatisfactory, which is why the film was made in the first place. Isn't it ironical, that in a country where the stereotype is that the affluent get away with all kinds of crime and in fact, pin it on their domestic help – this once the opposite happened and it very well could be the wrong decision? It does leave you exasperated at the end, and disturbed. I guess you can feel decent about yourself that with all the inhumanity in the world, its depiction in a film managed to send a chill down the spine.

Only the family is replaced by the lady's boyfriend who happens to be a wrathful and powerful goon himself. For this group of criminals, you are allowed the liberty of fowl language, also making the film a little different from your regular family drama. But there is just no other element in the film to get you interested, let alone keep you there. It is kind of nice that a love story was made without any mush but that you don't even sense the chemistry between the couple is a let-down. This is despite lots and lots of screen time with each other and plenty more than one intimate scene between the two. The writing, in every aspect - dialogue, characterization, story arc - is completely lackluster. And that's where the crux lies. When pretty much the whole plot is predictable you can have only so much interest in how the actual ending goes. When the characters have a flat arch it matters little that they carry a shade of grey. When the focus is making the film overtly typical of how a real life criminal would talk, the superficiality and in-your-face nature of the dialogue shines through more than the lines itself. There is very little then that Richa Chadda and Nikhil Dwivedi can do with their performances. They have the right expressions but they all seem too mechanical. Either like they are under some kind of stress or like they don't have their heart in it. Just one of those cases where the hard work shows instead of seeming effortless. Given the ""different"" setting for the love story Tamanchey could have had a spark that could've made it at least a film watching once, if not a good film. That as you know by now, didn't quite work out.

Though I might have a dozen places where the film could've been tighter, a plot point not seem random, and so on. To tell the same story again is a mean task. Especially, when the director has said the same story a few times himself. Now it feels like, each of those times might just have been a build-up towards this one. One that is blatant about being mundane and repetitive. One that is also a social commentary about the “system” killing the individual. One that tells you stop asking for stories that are different, because all stories are the same. Yet, make your own story because your story is different because it is about you.Last week we saw K struggle to find himself, in X: Past Is Present. We saw his past experiences make him the person he is now. He seems to be only an evolved version of Don in Tamasha. Only the two films talk about different influences in life. The former about his love relationships and this one is a contest between nature and nurture. Tamasha starts very Before Sunrise-ish and has all the smiles and warmth of any real-life romantic relationship that has just begun. Even if light-hearted, you can see the intensity of the attachment take hold. Even if you know nothing about either of the protagonists, just like they don't know each other, you know this trip is going to change their lives – that is, if they allow it to. Once this phase is over, like it is always meant to be, it became a little jarring that only one point of view is presented at a time. Mona who is not a prop is not a full-fledged character, either. She is more a catalyst to Don's self-discovery. This self-discovery itself is a little disconnected. Two points in the story attribute to this disconnect in the journey. One because of its presence in the film and the other because of its absence.  There is a part of the film where Don is missing in action. We know nothing of his thought process during that part. While this missing part left a nagging question mark during the film, after the film, it comes across as a convenient escape in the story-telling. Giving us a peek into Don's mind at that point would be very difficult to keep it consistent with what came before and what was to come after. So, was this a cop-out? However, we can make a guess of the stories Don might have told himself during this time. Stories we all tell ourselves when we believe that what is not meant to be, won't be – “the same story”. Though unlikely, if this inference was intentionally left to the audience – Tamasha is much better written than it seems. In another instance, we are shown the angst a young Don goes through when in college. The life that Don picks after that struggle just seems a little unlikely. As in, he seems old enough to understand the missing element in his life. It seems a little unlikely that he would reject that element so vehemently, when a mirror is held before him. Oh well, maybe truth is that difficult to handle. Having let go of these two slurs, Tamasha immerses without getting you completely absorbed. A part of it might be the charisma that Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone bring to screen. It is difficult to take your eyes off either of them when they are on screen. While they own their characters - their angst and their reality – they are still Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padokone. You catch yourself saying, “wow! what acting!” while watching the film. And while that does mean they have done a great job, they have also ended up reminding you, you are watching a film. And that is an ironical problem with this cast and crew, right? They are so good that each time we expect them to outdo themselves, be it the director or the actors. You have to remind yourself that they have brought home the point so beautifully. Was Ms. Padukone relegated to a supporting role? Screen-time-wise – yes. But, in terms of importance of the character – no. Doesn't it take great constraint to not let “screen-time needed” dictate the writing in a story? Sure, I'd like to have seen her have a bigger role, the woman's point of view presented. But, she had played her bit, it was now Don's turn to figure things out for himself. Did she have no self-respect, we may ask? But don't we all have that one person for whom we are incapable of giving self-respect any room. Why does she wait around for him? That one I will let you watch the film to figure it out. Ranbir Kapoor plays the seemingly bipolar character absolutely amazingly. Of course, there is drama, you were well-warned with the title. However, there is no melodrama. There are theatrics and those bring insight. Who is telling your story? Who is directing it? Who is the Raavan of your life? Who is your genie, your Hanuman? Some parallels across mythological and fairy tales were indeed thought-provoking. Some of the side characters made me squirm, though. The corporate world is presented all bad; the system painted all black. Don's manager, his colleagues are all caricatures. But, aren't they part of the system? If they are stuck in their roles too, don't they need our empathy? They do show some people okay with their place in the corporate world, Mona for instance. However, there could be some people who are okay being mediocre, right? Maybe we will have another film to celebrate mediocrity. And we are such that we will accept it to rise beyond mediocrity.Any film that makes you go into a thought circle like that has won me. While Tamasha might have aimed at it, it won't make you get up and relook your life and the many faces you carry. It won't make you rip off the mask you wear and let the beast in you out as soon as you walk out of the theater. But, if it makes you think in that direction for even a little bit, if it makes you look at your bipolar self which might just be normal, while making a genuine attempt at telling the same story differently, hasn't it done its job?

Its fun, adventurous, action packed, touching and filled with lough-out-loud scenes. A complete package indeed. On top of it the first half could very well be called a musical, and a very good one at that, mind you. It takes the fairytale of Rapunzel and creates a thrilling adventure for you to enjoy with your family and friends. We all walked out of the theatre - content, grinning to each other and getting every bit of our moneys worth and then some. An absolute must watch in theatres.","Tangled is a story of the long haired princess Rapunzel. “Oh, but we all know the story of Rapunzel, so whats new in there?” - you may ask. Aherm, absolutely great visuals for starters. This is the first CGI fairytale from Disney and it is totally worth the wait. For once, they’ve made some intelligent use of 3D technology and the scenes are not forced. The story is predictable, but isn’t that the case with all Disney animated movies in general? No one goes to watch Disney animation movies for their brilliant plot. We go there to laugh & cry and sing & dance with the characters we know we are going to fall in love with. Tangled does all that with great finesse. It has some very imaginative and lovely characters, especially the horse and the chameleon. Irrelevant and needless information alert: My love for movies descends largely from my dad, and my elder brother. But Dad loves action, brother is a sucker for science fiction and I had a particular liking for murder mysteries. Animated movies were something we all liked immensely and always made up for a good watch together. The point is animated films have that quality to bring a family together. To have in it, something for everyone. To give everyone a happy time. I love musicals. Though, Tangled is not your classic musical, it certainly has its elements. Alan Menken has a done a superb job with the music and Glen Slater’s lyrics are great too. Some of the songs bore striking resemblance to Mulan, that probably would be because both movies share the same director in Byron Howard (co-director in case of Tangled as Nathan Greno was mentioned as the director too). Let the records reflect that I’m now officially a fan of this guy.  ‘When will my life begin’ felt a lot like Mulan’s ‘Reflection’ and ‘I’ve got a dream’ had a  ‘A girl worth fighting for’ like ring to it. I’ve listened a lot to Mulan’s OST and am looking forward to listen to Tangled’s too. Usually, if the voice-over artists are not the singers too, its a huge turn off. Thankfully, Tangled had a voice-over artist who could sing masterfully - Mandy Moore. She’s done a fabulous job as Rapunzel. But I expect excellence in singing from Mandy Moore. Who surprised me was Zachary Levi. Donna Murphy was all class as the evil Mother Gothel. The supporting cast was superb in their small yet thoroughly entertaining roles.I guess, I’ve convinced you enough, so grab a few friends or take your family along with you and enjoy this movie. If you have kids its a crime punishable by law in the state of Neverland, not to take your kids for this movie. Watch in theatres for sure.

All of which is tied up in the 20 most 'blah' ones ever written. You do the math. Kangna is a misfit and the film has the worst climax a film could ever have.,"Remember Saajan? And the dozen other films which had a struggle going on between two male leads who love the same woman? They'd play badminton and she'd be the shuttlecock? I hated the supposed large-heartedness of one friend 'sacrificing' the girl for/to his friend, as if she has no say in who she is in love with. In Tanu weds Manu our lady, Tanu has a fully-installed brain. Unfortunately, it's malfunctioning or maybe her heart is not in-sync because she is still the shuttlecock. Only this time, it's of the lady's own doing. Yet, it doesn't make the story any more interesting. At least, not the way it's written here. So what if the first 45 minutes of the film are as entertaining as they could ever be!? All's not well, if it doesn't end well, no? The movie starts with such crisp and witty dialogue (and perfect delivery by the actors) that everyone in the audience was laughing out loud at every alternate dialogue. Alternate dialogue only because the laughter from the earlier dialogue hadn't died down for us to hear the next one. Yep, even though I didn't hear half the dialogues in the first half, I was thoroughly entertained. All this I was still trying my best to get used to Kangna Ranaut as Tanu. Though, I don't think I ever settled down on that count. It was very difficult to shake away the question - what if someone else was playing the loud, boisterous, small-town girl who doesn't know what to do with all the male attention she gets. While, Kangna just about passes off in traditional Indian clothes and make-up, I just don't think she can carry long dialogues. Almost every dialogue comes across as if it were a tongue twister for her. While she deserves all marks for trying something out of her comfort zone, some of the lines given to her are wasted because she doesn't fit the bill. On the other hand Madhavan perfectly wears the shoes of an NRI who is on his 'girl-seeing' trip to India - unsure, sticking out, and embarrassed by all the mollycoddling. But this act along with his spinelessness loses charm soon enough and becomes repetitive. The rest of the characters are marginally interesting, in fits and starts. That's because they just didn't get any attention from the writer; else, they had potential to capture yours. This is sad because I was sitting amongst a crowd that cheered Ravi Kissen and Deepak Dobriyal in their first scenes. Sure, the main characters are written in detail, but the plot fails. You barely care for Tanu. The character that she is, you don't think she deserves all that she wants out of life. She is so oblivious to the ruckus she's causing in others' lives. And the specimen of nature that Manu is you want him to get Tanu, only because that's what he wants; you know it's not the best thing for him. These are interesting things, because the protagonists are grey characters, but somehow it all looks half-cooked. Also there is a lot happening in the film other than the superficial. You have one Che Guevara worshipper who is doing things just to be labeled a rebel. While the other one with a Guevara poster in his room propagates a value system that makes you do things just so your parents are happy. The latter gives an inch because he's nice and the people around him take an ell and more. They either meddle and manage his life or misuse his kindness. This is only a scratch on the surface of this generation's struggle - be nice and misused OR use and be nasty. At the same time, Tanu weds Manu tries to show how the definition of love is different for each person. At the macro level too, Tanu weds Manu tries to say a thing or two about the society and its changing equations. For example, the one between a bride and groom's side at an Indian wedding. And all this along with some awesome music that go completely with the tone of the film. Alas, the tone changes and the makers don't get that right.Just when the writing starts to lull, you are given a break with the interval. But the jokes dry up, the characters become serious and clueless. It's depressing to see the same writer who wrote such brilliant lines in the first hour or so regress to total boredom and write the most annoying climax a film could ever have. I started out thinking this is the Indies reply to YRF 'wedding' films and I ended up writing this review.

But Tanu Weds Manu Returns isn't likely to remain with you as film, because of its rather ludicrous plot. Add to that the issues regarding gender and sexism that every film by Aanand L Rai tends to contain, and what you're left with is a film that could have been, but isn't.  ","Let's talk about Kangana Ranaut later.First, let's talk about writer-director Aanand L Rai. With his last two films - Raanjhanaa and Tanu Weds Manu - Rai has shown that he can bring out the flavour and texture of the Hindi heartland in particular and North India in general spot on. Yet, both those films also brought out India's inherent sexism (bordering on misogyny) in a manner rarely seen before. But here's the thing - it is a bit of a task, attempting to figure out if he is actually attempting satire, or if he is revelling in this sexism, making it enjoyable for the casual movie-going public.Tanu Weds Manu Returns is a film that keeps you interested at all times. It is beautifully acted, funny for the most, and it has a few moments that make you truly celebrate the fact that women can be as liberated, courageous and stunningly larger-than-life as men in popular Hindi cinema are. It also has Rai's trademark of capturing milieu like few others. But look a little deeper and you may find yourself wondering if Rai is actually being progressive, or whether he is merely using stereotypes to his advantage, to make a film that appeals to the masses.Right off the bat, Tanu Weds Manu Returns starts off exactly where the first film left us. Then, cut to four years later, we see that the couple is, expectedly, facing some serious marital problems; so much so that they're on the cusp of divorce. With the marriage in a state of despair, Manu finds himself faced with an unexpected development - another woman in his life, one who looks exactly like Tanu.With its brisk pace, rat-a-tat dialogue, catchy music and truly noteworthy performances, it is quite easy to be charmed by the film. There's always something happening, and there's always a line to laugh at. However, it is also an exceedingly convoluted film. Manu's idea of love, in particular, is so frustrating that one wonders if such a man would ever be happy in life. He seems to fall in and out of love-at-first-sight with impossible ease. Basically, he is a spineless twit who can't seem to think straight unless someone whacks him on the head with a sledgehammer. Then, there's Tanu. Yes, she is a breath of fresh air as a female lead character in our cinema. You wouldn't want to mess with her even on your best day. On a bad day, well, God help you. As a human being, she is beautifully flawed. A real life Tanu would be an inspiration. But as a cinematic character, she is too one-note to tolerate for too long. Over the course of two films, Tanu has shown no graph, no growth, no sense of learning with age. She may be outrageously funny, but after a point, it becomes hard to take her seriously. The new player in the game, Tanu's lookalike, a Haryanvi girl named Datto, is easily the best thing about the film. And here's where Kangana Ranaut's range as an actor truly comes to the fore. At the script level the two characters are like chalk and cheese anyway. At the performance level, Ranaut manages to infuse such varied personalities into both characters that it is hard to imagine the same person has played both roles. She has more than a couple of clap-trap scenes in the film, the credit for which must go to her as much as to Aanand L Rai.However, as much fun as the film can be, it is also an equally baffling film. There are at least two pointless subplots that add no value to it, all while you're expecting some sort of jaw-dropping payoff that never arrives. The main plot itself is, at best, asinine. Eventually, the film is held together pretty much by the performances across the board, mostly by the supporting characters. Jimmy Sheirgill and Deepak Dobriyal reprise their roles from the earlier film, and they are pitch-perfect in their performances. New entrant Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, who also featured in Raanjhana as Dhanush's best friend, is outstanding as the crazed-lawyer-turned-lovestruck-maniac. R Madhavan has an affable presence, but there are just too many fine actors around him for him to truly make an impact. Obviously, prime among them is Kangana Ranaut.Despite being let down by the writing of her character, it is Ranaut's spunk and spontaneity that carry you through to the end of the film. This film is no Queen, but it will be no surprise at all if she's what stays with you the longest, after watching the film.Aanand L Rai clearly is one of the more talented directors in Hindi cinema. But now, more than ever, it seems likes he makes films for an audience that likes the kind of humour that propagates the very gender inequalities and stereotypes that the contemporary (but mostly urban) Indian citizen abhors. Tanu Weds Manu Returns - its rather senseless name notwithstanding - can be a fun film to watch and laugh with. But if you're really looking to take something away from it, then all you're going to be left with is Kangana Ranaut's swagger.

Composed and elegant. Aamir Khan delivers his first baby with élan. The hard labor shows in a compassionate portrayal of a sensitive issue.,"How can one not love a movie about children crafted with utmost compassion - children with special needs at that? But, is that the only reason I liked Tare Zameen Par? Maybe - maybe not. What I know for sure is that a strong one-line story is narrated extremely charmingly. It is truly uplifting when spirit wins and yet, it is not all about the spirit of winning.Tare Zameer Par is about a child who suffers because no one around him recognizes that he is a slow learner. The beauty of the narration is that the message applies to all children - learning disability or not. How can creativity not deserve a place in academics?  It also points a very subtle finger at how we build conformation in our system right at the roots.The pace of the first half gives you time to think of normal children who are just not academically inclined.  The resolution in the second half, however, comes by too quickly compared to the trauma shown earlier. But, I guess, if the point is to show that difficulties can be overcome, you don't necessarily want to show how difficult it is to overcome them. About 45 minutes post-interval, Darsheel Safary (Ishaan) said a line which made me realize that he hadn't said a line in the last hour or so. There I was feeling sorry for Ishaan, feeling like yelling at someone to give him a big hug while I fought this lump in my throat that had been there for the longest time. All this based solely on Darsheel's expressions and body language! Kudos to the director for taking this decision and many such with brilliant confidence. And, finally we have a dialogue writer who knows when not to give the actors a helping hand. There are a couple of verbose, preachy scenes. But, they made the point because they were well written. Aamir Khan's entry into the movie seemed over-the-top and forced, mainly because it was in absolute contrast with the tone of the movie thus far. But after a little while you realize that you can't distinguish between the actor/director Aamir Khan and his character Nikhumb. They are both fighting the same cause. Passionately. The other characters serve their purpose as caricatures - stereotypical father, loving mother, understanding sibling, ruthless teacher, and jeering peers.No matter who or what the focus of the camera is, the love it feels towards its subjects shows in each frame. And, in turn, you fall in love with what you see on screen. Compositions, lighting, angles, colors all work successfully together to engross you and very often to enchant you. The lingering camera might have added a good 10-15 minutes to the run-time. But you will be hard-pressed to point out exact scenes which the movie could have done without. Everything is building character or atmosphere or both.  The songs too contribute to the narrative. The lyrics are sheer poetry. I know-I know, that's what they are supposed to be, but can't remember the last time lyrics brought me to tears. ""mein kabhi batlaata nahi"" kept me speechless (and we all know how difficult that is!). And rock-style guitar strumming to a kids' song - that's what I call creative. Yes, that dash of seemingly inevitable melodrama exists. The side-characters transform for no apparent reason. The climax is exaggerated and is as unrealistic as it could get. However, the aim is to show not reality of life but reality of the condition that this child suffers from. Once you get that, you pardon the make-up a mother is wearing at 6 AM while doing her chores. And anyway, most of this is towards the end, by which time you are willing to forgive. Because, above all else, it makes you think.When did we grow up? When along the way did we forget what it felt like to be yelled at, to be put down, to be ridiculed? And why did we choose the next generation for revenge? Will we recognize the child in us that is struggling to get out? Will the sensation that the lump in the throat created, stay after the credits roll?

Fitting it into a stereotype - a very 90-ish film!","I thought a film marketed with a rugged look would be an action flick. But, surprise-surprise Tashan is an out-and-out comedy. The action makes you laugh, the romance makes you laugh louder, and it is so funny that the characters make you laugh even when they are seething with anger. And the beauty is I haven't been able to figure out whether any of this was intentional! Speaking of beauty, after a long time have I seen India shot so beautifully. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) were all saturated with color, alright. Nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when I could go there. But alas! Come action sequences, and the camera blows its horn too hard. It doesn't allow the audience to register the seemingly interesting stunts. Similarly, there were glimpses of interesting editing decisions. Like when a character says 'BITCH' with a long 'i' and the scene cuts to a long shot of a beach or when ""kabhi kabhi"" is playing and a car falls down a cliff when the song reaches ""tujhe zameen par bulaya gaya"" (you have been called to the earth) part. That the car flying in the air was very shoddily animated is a different story altogether.However, what really surprised me is that the four main characters in the film had actually different traits which were more-or-less consistently adhered to. What's more, each one had a story arc too!? - Very atypical of a Hindi movie in this genre.  An underworld don, a wannabe don with super-powers, a supposed simpleton, and a lady with a mission - all with brain and brawn. (yes the girl too! YAY!!) Sounds like a decent enough premise. But something grossly went wrong in the execution. And I could complain about artistic liberties taken, if only there was any art in sight.A big fat finger can be pointed at the dialogues. My fears came true, as in the word ""the"" was overused. I think the writer was pretty sure people are going to go off to sleep. Which is why the name of the movie is repeated every half hour - to orient the people who have just woken up! Also, Hindi-fying of English was done in such abundance that I was soon immune to it. So, while it didn't bother me, it didn't make me laugh either. Sure, there were obvious tributes to Deewar, Sholay, and Jaane Bhi do Yaaro. Would have been good if they were done well, though.What is amazing is that despite really lousy dialogues, each one of the four actors has given a good performance. Having the right expressions (exaggerated as they might be) to rise above the bad lines must be applauded in any case. Certainly, the roles must have looked interesting at script stage for established actors like them to give Tashan space in their portfolio. Of course, Kareena overshadowed the male trio put together in the ""looks"" department. By the way, am I the only one here to sense that Akshay Kumar and Saif Ali Khan are too old and too mature in this industry to flout their 'sexiness' in such an inelegant, uncouth way? The songs functioned like the snooze button for me. I felt like muting it off when a song started and suffered the familiar rude shock five minutes later when it ended giving charge to the louder background music. So loud that it overshadowed dialogue at many points. The lyrics, the choreography and of course the music, all seemed too generic and random.  Actually a level below generic. We can see Kareena not only sporting the golden ""Aishwarya look"" from Dhoom 2 but she also has a few of Aishwarya's dance moves! And why was Saif Ali Khan made to look like he couldn't dance to save his life? Despite the things done right, while leaving the theater I was praying that Vijay Acharya hadn't over-dosed me with whatever anesthetic it was he was using. The numbness I felt in the brain region was really scary. Anyway, all's good, I'm out of it and hoping to keep you away from it

It doesn’t take courage, insight, expertise or inexplicable talent to create a film that makes a statement about existence, life, politics and about the deteriorating state of affairs in what we so naively call ‘real life’. All it takes is cinema itself. What can stir up the deepest, most stagnant corners of our insipid souls than love? And what can make us reminisce about the farthest, most forgotten stories of love in our own lives than music? Qaushik Mukherjee (or Q, as he calls himself,) leaves Gandu far, far behind with his Tasher Desh, an adaptation – I call it that only, perhaps, because of my limited vocabulary – of a Rabindranath Tagore play of the same name. I must confess, my only exposure to the play prior to watching the film was reading its name in mere passing, in one of my many online excursions way back in time. Surely, though, I doubt even Tagore would ever have imagined his play brought to life in this manner.At its best, Tasher Desh is a scathing commentary on everything that is wrong with mankind today. At its worst, it is an unfathomable orgy of images and sounds that can either intrigue you or put you off, depending on which end of the spectrum of creative freedom you stand on. You might either walk out of the film because you just don’t get it, or you might stay till the end, trying to decipher meaning and wisdom from the startling visual and aural experience that you’ve been subjected to. Either way, it’s okay – because even the fundamental differences between right and wrong are but subjective in nature.To even briefly talk about the ‘story’ of the film would be to do thorough disservice to it; although the film’s one line premise would read much like Tagore’s play – a Prince and his friend (sidekick, conscience, alter-ego, who knows?) attempt to break free from the questions that plague them, ending up in a distant land across the sea – a land inhabited by the Card people; a race bound by rules and order. If you think this description is mysterious, wait till you watch the film.The first thing about the film that instantly grabs you is the three distinct colour tones used in the first hour of the film – a black-and-white look that has a narrator who wants to put up a production of Tasher Desh; washed out colour showing the Prince, his friend and his mother, the Queen, who are characters from the play; and the trippy, outlandish explosion of colour which seem to show the states of mind of the characters from the play. (This third colour tone was reminiscent of the hallucinogen-induced imagery from the 2012 film Dredd – enough to spawn at least some amount of clarity amidst the befuddlement.) The appearance of these three colour tones is seemingly random; images are cut and juxtaposed with alarming alacrity. The film will either draw you in right then, or you will reject it as indulgence (an innocuous, frequently-bandied term that few realize is far more subjective than simply ‘good’ or ‘bad’.)In the second hour, in trying to show a land with order, the film descends into absolute chaos. Even the subtitles assume a life of their own, visually as well as in meaning. And yet, within this chaos, one can see the beauty of pure, uncorrupted anarchy – of self-governance and of self-censorship. Indeed, wouldn’t the world be a far more tolerable place if every person has sense enough to control and govern his or her own behaviour?Here, in this second hour, is when the film comes into its own. It is no-holds-barred in its approach towards the narrative and the message it gives out; and yet it refrains from being sermonizing. It asks as much as it tells, and it urges you to see for yourself the glaring, dismal truth of the land it portrays. The images and sounds are rapid and urgent; the unraveling of these images and sounds, however, is leisurely. After all, it is ultimately a film – a world-view, a state of mind. The music of Tasher Desh is another tale of trip altogether. The songs are supposedly from Tagore’s play itself, but the eclectic, fusion rendition of the songs, combined with lyrics that are all Tagore, truly propel the narrative; the music is easily the soul of the film. To put it mildly, Tasher Desh is daring for an Indian film. I don’t know about the rest of the world, but I sure won’t judge you for not liking it. In fact, I would go so far as to request you to stay away from Tasher Desh; because it is likely the kind of high you won’t be able to handle.

It could have been. Had it not folded the game's nuances out of sight or been blind the psyche of the players. A wonderful performance by Amitabh Bachchan and his stooped shoulders can carry only so much weight of the other non-actors. ,"I've a problem with films that so heavily bank on a particular theme but provide no technical background about it and do not make an attempt to weave it into the main plot. In this case, it’s the game of ""Teen Patti"" (a reduced form of Poker, I believe). Replace the gambling background with any other field in which the protagonist is an expert and voila we have another film - Fixing of games in sports, organ trade…o-kay I'm getting crude, but you see what I mean. There is absolutely no attempt at showing us how the game or the system around it works. I'm not asking for a lesson, but I should know the writers are actually interested in their film's premise. Without those details, to me the master plan just looked like peeping into other people's cards and figuring out who has a better hand. Some genius. There is ample attempt at making it look and sound interesting, with rugged and glamorous sets as needed. And with psycho-babble about life, happiness and sundry. But that's all it remains a trial - which did not work. The only thing which worked is Amitabh Bachchan's acting, but then, when is the last time it didn't? And why would I want to watch a film for that when there are so many other options with the same feature. The rest of the cast including R. Madhavan who usually does a very good job of convincing us of his character, is shudder-inducing. Anyway, it's not like there are very well-written characters. And this, despite all of them being gray. None of them are outright villainous and they surely don’t aspire to be heroic. They are each given a non-caricature-like distinguishing feature, but this isn't taken any further. No details, no nuances. They did know we are going to take objection to the woman being used only for her form and be treated as more or less brainless. Thankfully, the team of students who are making careers in gambling aren't shown as professional thugs who get it right from the word go. They try to maintain balance, with each of the team members going wrong in their plans and getting them all in trouble. But it soon becomes a pattern that you can easily see through. And the whole justification of carrying on one silly scheme after the other is pretty bonkers too. The basic, basic premise is taken from 21. Of course, the makers wanted to feel creative, so the protagonist and the sub-plots are changed around. Too little, in the early, the middle and the latter parts too. Only it gets more and more fragmented and ridiculous as it progresses towards the climax.There ain't no meat in the concept, the story, or the sub-plots. The only thing that keeps it going from being a complete write-off is Amitabh Bachchan's acting. Is that enough? This once, it doesn't look like it.

Slapstick is slapstick is slapstick - especially if it is distasteful. A fart won't be funny just because it’s a fart even if it is Om Puri's. Even our Pune roads are flatter than the lines, situations and the film in general. (That's not saying much, but even so!)","I don't know what the filmmakers felt while making the film or even while watching the film in its entirety for the first time. Teen Thay Bhai was certainly embarrassing to watch. And this is despite the film being devoid of sexual humor. Just watching three great performers going from one unfunny gag into another is extremely uncomfortable.You still remember Om Puri's brilliant performances despite some really awful scripts he's picked; Shreyas Talpade doesn't need to prove his comic timing anymore; and Deepak Dobriyal is someone who has graduated from smaller, indie films into a performer you look forward to, however tiny his role. And they have a perfectly funny situation laid out before them. They are 3 brothers who hate each other but are forced to spend time together. Unfortunately, the only few times you do laugh/smile is owing to the actors 'rising above' the script and lines they are handed. At other times, all you want to tell the makers is ok, we get the whole shirtless Salman mockery you are trying to pull, but it's not funny just because Dobriyal is doing it.You know how any 'respectful' Hindi family film is going to end when it starts with hatred. And the writers try to show how we try to find someone to blame for our weaknesses, but it's too plain and too in-the-face, they try subtlety and then give up, just in case the audience doesn't 'get' it. Besides you cannot have a story with no ups and downs, just one flat tone that the audience can choose to ignore and doze off. And no, an irrelevant sub-plot involving foreigners and cops doesn't help!Interesting though, the movie starts and maintains some very good production values. Especially the lighting. They used very low lighting and maintained grays and browns despite the genre of the film. But then flashbacks are uses as an excuse to go into a contrast in tone - loud colors, background music. They are also used as an excuse to infuse romance, song & dance, and drama in the plot. This change in ambiance is disorienting. But that's immaterial because it's not like brown/gray/low-light 'style' make the writing or the lame jokes better. I'm confused. What do I feel worse about? High-budget films without a story or low-budget, indie films produced by the likes of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra paying no attention to the writing.

But, they are sniggering amongst themselves. It's one thing to laugh at anything and everything from - the umbilical cord to patriotism - and it's a whole other thing  NOT TO make us laugh with them. So obnoxious is the film along with its stars Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif  that the subtle points that Tees Maar Khan seems to make, come across as completely accidental.","As hard as it is to believe, Tees Maar Khan subtly remarks about the state of the country. National treasure being passed on from the administrative authorities to thugs. What else is it, if it is not a commentary, when the same thugs make a mockery of the law and order system - standing smack in the middle of a courtroom? All this by a ""con artist"" pulling off a heist almost as if he has the blessings of the police. Trying to make sense out of the non-stop chaos that the rest of the film is, these subtleties may seem like accidents. But, you have to give this one to them. Using a village full of village fools as representatives, the filmmakers are certainly pointing a big fat finger at us, the audience who laps up this stuff in the name of masala.I didn't grow up watching Keislowski and Fellini. Far from it. I was brought up to love masala-makers turned filmmakers.  I laughed and cried with the actors and the characters they played. Then too, it was a world ruled by stars. But now I laugh with contempt and weep at only one person - me. A part of the audience. How and when did definition of masala entertainment change from a coherent story to a broadly set-up plot strung together with the most plainly written sub-sequences? When did strong romantic undercurrent transform into Sheila romancing her own jawaani or the hero overtly and superficially caring about her modesty? The only thing that seems to have come through the decades is the random breaking into song and dance. Oh well, Jai Ho? I agree Katrina Kaif played the annoying bimbo to perfection, but then, was it acting at all? I don't mean this as an insult, I just question her choice of a role. I cannot even bring myself to comment on Akshay Kumar's loud utterances of words that seem to be getting at a sentence. Because most of the time, he's either saying ""ta...f ki izzat ..something..tees maar khan...something..."" or is just narrating what's going to happen in the story in the next 20 minutes. Incidentally the word ""tawaif"" (haaaw, I said it!) is beeped out as per censor requirements. And I think Farah Khan has the last laugh on this one because what we end up hearing is ""beeeep..f..ki izzat..."" That one cracked me up. And a couple of other jokes. I know you are supposed to laugh at the silliness. But I demand that the silliness be funny not lame. I'd like to respect the woman (Farah) for making a film, it's a difficult process, I admit. But, I'd like a little respect in return, for my sense and sensibility.

And as the film progresses the story keeps getting more and more ridiculous. ,"What does it say about a film if you can't shake off the feeling that it is only a vehicle for the mother (Hema Malinito re-launch her daughter (Esha Deol), just like the father (Dharmendra) keeps doing that for his sons (Bobby Deol and Sunny Deol). Watch the closing song which is about Esha and not Tanya, the character she plays! I doubt even Salman Khan's item appearance here can do the trick though. Someone needs to tell the family, that its not working. They should all move into side-character roles soon, if they are going to stick to acting that is. They don't look good, they don't emote well. Anyway so, what does it say about the film if you can't shake off the feeling that Tanya is looking for her biological parents only so that she can go to different exotic locations with her boyfriend and friend who is a boy? It tells you a lot when you are constantly aware of the biological relationships between the crew of a film while watching it. Tell Me O Khuda fails to engage, it fails to make you identify with its characters, it fails to keep you interested through the duration of the film. The only good thing that can be said about the film is that the protagonist sets out on an interesting journey. But the narrations is so lackluster, that even though she turns into an activist and a psychologist on the way, you don't feel like laughing at it. And for that one good thing, I cannot ask you to watch the film even if its playing on TV, while skimming through channels may be you can stop for a bit. But, that's about it.

A narrative that is in a constant state of exposition – a voiceover of the hero, Raghu (Himesh Resammiya) tells you what hero is doing while it is happening on screen. Let alone “show, don't tell”, this seems clearly to circumvent the need for the hero to act. As ironical as it is, that Himesh Reshammiya takes himself so seriously is mighty amusing. He has this intense look which works well when there is a need to be intense, but the rest of the time it is just funny. It is like his character is expecting doom. All. The. Time. Even while he is falling in love, he looks like he is readying himself to mourn for the break-up. Farah Karimaee would need to start from the basics if she wants to act in more films – like say, dialogue delivery. Here it is not too bad because, she is required to play prop. What else can you make of a song that has her change into skimpier clothes with every eighth beat? This when the rest of the people on the streets of Dublin she is walking on, are covered head-to-toe to counter winter. That is the attitude of this film towards film-making - over-styling, over-acting, over-exposing; under-writing, under-directing, under-wanting-to-make-a-film. Truly, Teraa Surroor feels like a film that was made with the sole intention of adding to work experience in LinkedIn profiles of everyone who was involved with the film.The interesting bit is that if you sit back and try to summarize the story of the film, it is not too bad. With a little more work on making it real, it could have been a half-decent film. But see, that was not what they were aiming for – a watchable film.

You'll miss out on loads of fun if you miss this one. When you are helpless and can do zilch, the least you can do is present a laughable solution to a hopeless situation.","3 issue-based films in a day - Two related to global political situations (Lamhaa and Tere Bin Laden ) and one addressing a social issue that needs immediate attention (Udaan). Lesson at the end of the day - there are two ways of looking at any matter of importance. Bear me for the colloquial usage - one is 'load leke' and the other 'chill maar ke' (seriously and the other lightly). Tere Bin Ladentakes the chilled-out route and how!! The snotty attitude that I have towards both slapstick and satire, I'd never have imagined I'd laugh even once at a combination of both. And when I wasn't laughing out loud, I was forced to wear a wide smile at the subtle references to current affairs. The tongue-in-cheek remarks hardly ever stop. If not words, some prop, or something in the background is vying to reach out to your funny bone. The sequences and situations also are one fun one after the other. And all this is happening while constantly making a remark on the futility of the war and the unashamed mask of righteousness people wear to justify killing each other. If not that the remark is on some stereotype. Every bit makes you realize how much thought has gone into making the point but without making it dramatic. While the first half is setting the situation, the second half becomes surreal or what we can easily call a Tom & Jerry affair. The transition is a bit disorienting.  But the so-silly-and-farfetched-that-you-have-to-laugh situations use dark humor, spoof stereotypes, mock media, and ridicule reality shows. They tickle, make you think, and get you worried about the characters, all in one go. I wish I could give out some of the brilliant understated statements made. I just wouldn't be able to take it on my conscience if I spoiled even one gag for you. All I can tell you is Ali Zaffar, a Pakistani reporter lands himself in a situation where he makes an Osama look-alike make a statement to the US. He puts together an entire crew - make-up artist, voice artist, editor, actor, and an executive-producer. You can only imagine how crazy it can get if it is done right. And done right it is.May I thank you Mr. Abhishek Sharma for doing exactly what you believed in without heeding to supposed commercial requirements. No hero who has a heroine to woo, no over-the-top garishness just for the heck of it. I know it's a shame that we live in times that make us appreciate the things avoided in a film, rather than what it contains. But this once, we have a winner that has achieved both and more.

Interesting situations get repetitive, jokes unfunny and film bizarre.","What if a Osama look-alike is needed and found by both the US and some Mujahideen? Such an interesting premise for a story. And you have the intention to make it comical – a spoof on terrorism, war, international politics, film industries and more. As engaging as that sounds, Tere Bin Laden – Dead or Alive gets into repetitive situations and ends up making 110 minutes seem way longer than they are. From the beginning the movie is loud and doesn't try to mask the fact that it is aiming for slapstick. Even so, it is acceptable because the satire is amusing. Unfortunately, the well of satire has little water and dries up soon. What is left then is the ridiculous situation that our characters have found themselves in. Ridiculous doesn't always equal funny though. You could laugh at how silly all of it is. But, each of those laughs is wiped out by stretching the scene way longer than its viable life. The actors can only do so much. They are asked to be loud and loud they are. Of the lot, Pradhuman Singh stays as restrained as it can possibly be making his character quite adorable, as it is meant to be. Interestingly, Ali Zafar is annoyingly insuferable as he is meant to be too. Manish Paul overplays the comedy but again it is difficult to comment on his over-acting without blaming the writer-director. With little in the story beyond the basic premise, Tere Bin Laden Dead or Alive ends up just killing its potential to be lively. See, I am bored enough to do bad puns too.  Better stop here.

There are a few laughs, but they come too late in the film and even so, are few and far between.","Who would have thought that in a film starring Vinay Pathak, I'd be complaining about limited talent? But, that happens when you are fooled into believing that it is a Vinay Pathak film. Tere Mere Phere is almost 75% about Rahul (Jagrat Desai) and Pooja (Sasha Goradia) than it is about Jai played by Vinay Pathak. And boy, do Rahul and Pooja annoy! It's cute to see arguments that you have at home, on the big screen. You sort-of, kind-of can identify with the characters. But the issue here is Rahul and Pooja are bickering as a newly-wed couple. And most of their rows reminded me of the kind of tiffs I had with my brother, when I was 10 and he was 5! - That is the kind of amateur writing we are talking about. It's a little unsettling then, when you see sudden insight in the dialogue spouted by an unlikely character or even a subtle suggestion in terms of what a character does. For example, the thing that a newly-wed wife wouldn't want her husband to be exposed to her natural processes, things that make her too human. Or like the mom of a newly-wed son wants to be a part of his life. But then there are things like a character is so childlike two scenes ago, suddenly gains wisdom. So, you have a character who aims at having perfect relationships, be it with her husband or her mother-in-law, but at the same time breaks glassware when angry.I understand lovers' spats are like that, you fight and you make-up, you quarrel and you try to understand. But here, there seemed to be no pattern other than convenience for the writer. I mean, how can a HUGE fight about a reasonably huge error on the part of a spouse, be forgiven within minutes? Like the said insights, there is a dash of humor that shows up as a surprise. Surprise because the laughs come after the interval and even after they start, the quips are too far apart. I liked the relief in the form of Rahul's family played by Darshan Jariwala, the actor who plays his younger son (?) and even Sushmita Mukherjee, but wouldn't watch an entire film of a couple squabbling for that.Other than that though, it's mostly screeching and shouting. I was astounded that a woman director would portray ALL three of her women characters as high-pitched, bossy-pushy women. And it's not like she was not involved in the writing, Deepa Sahi is a co-writer. And yet, it would be unfair to judge Deepa Sahi's directorial capabilities based on just Tere Mere Phere. A huge part of why the film comes across as a shoddy product is because of the budget constraints. I'm assuming, that had there been a better budget, there would have been better actors. And with different actors, this is one film which could have been very different. And of course, at least 20-25 minutes edited out. I push a lot of the blame on the actors because you can understand that the ""look"" of a film suffers at the hands of a low budget. But, some things are quite in control of an actor. For example, Sasha Goradia's  dubbing was that like of a English film dubbed in Hindi. Very distracting, very irritating. Especially when she laughs or screeches - which is a lot. And yet, the film is not a complete loss. That's because of the relatable subject, a little humor, a little hope of watching Vinay Pathak. Basically, something to stop by for a bit while skipping channels.

Very Loud. Yet if you are in that giggly/exuberant mood can be an enjoyable 'nothing better to do' watch.,"The moment characters in a film begin reacting to everything by yelling at the top of their voices, I'm put off. Invariably, there is insistent background music as accompaniment too. Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya hits that nail on the spot. That besides, there is nothing much going for it in terms of story or logic.Well, there is nothing logical about a strong-headed woman who has her own mind and knows what she wants not being able to avoid marriage till she finds the right guy. At that very basic level, Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya fails. But, I guess, you could give it to them, at what they were trying to do by the end. It's miraculous how the entire film seems to revolve around Minnie (Genelia D'Souza (Deshmukh(?))) and yet it ultimately is up to the man of the film, Viren (Riteish Deshmukh) to show who wears the pants. Of course, the climax is something we should have given up on, after the first time it was used in a film. But, oh well, all is fair in love, war and Bolly-com - is what the audience has to come to terms with. The only thing going for the film then, is the lead pair - Riteish Deshmukh and Genelia D'Souza. Genelia D'Souza is no doubt very pretty and one could just alternate between her glinting eyes and charming smile for a couple of hours. You'd enjoy it even more if you are not distracted by her exaggerated hand-gestures and shrill voice, like me. And if you actually like that kind of body language and dialogue delivery, I wouldn't even venture into how much it'd mean to you. But, I tire easily of over-enthusiastic characters, in real life too, and we've seen too much of those in recent times, anyway. Riteish Deshmukh on the other hand plays the perfect lad-in-distress - helpless, clueless yet surprisingly sure of what he wants in life. Yet, many a time, you just want him to act normal and see if that works for you. The rest of the cast is a loud bunch, which is why the 2-3 glimpses of subtle understanding that you see from Om Puri come as a surprise. They remind you of what he is capable of. Unfortunately, Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya is so caught up in being exuberant and funny that it does injustice to the 'message' that it wants to send. Even so, when the underlying motivation does come across, it is a pleasant surprise and you wish you had more. That was my problem with Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya. It tried too hard to keep that smile on my face. Fine, I did enjoy a few moments, but then there were others that got annoying. And, anyway, ultimately the boy-meets-girl story had no other meat in it.

But, remains just that. Beyond girl meets boy and the ‘aawww’ that goes with that – thrice over, Teri Meri Kahaani has no hook to make it even a near-unique experience.","Love transcends generations. True love transcends logic. Romantic relationships were the same a hundred years ago and will live their viciously circular life for ages to come. Most of us know this first-hand, yet there are some parts of our lives we don’t mind watching Priyanka Chopra and Shahid Kapoor enact. But, three times is two times too much. Teri Meri Kahaani takes the concept a little too seriously and offers no variety in the sameness of love over a century. One of the things Teri Meri Kahaani tries to convey is that when love is at first sight; when connections seem magical; when vibes run too strong to ignore – it could imply a deeper bond. A bond that crosses life-times. A beautiful thought that. But writer, Kunal Kohli doesn’t  do anything exceptional with this lovely theme. Teri Meri Kahaani ends up being the same ol’ love story repeated in a span of two hours.One would then think that the way the three stories tie in would mean something more than just, ‘it’s meant to be’. Unfortunately, the climax which builds up nicely is a damp squib. Yet, the film holds up because of the performances, some sparkling dialogue and the inherent sweetness of romantic relationships as they are when they start.We see Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra disarm each other with their charm thrice and if it doesn’t get tiring it is only because of their performances. Many moments and lots of chemistry keep you engaged in them as actors, even if the story and characters aren’t all that interesting. This is despite the fact that all three characters that each one of them play are almost the same, except for Ruksar who is a meek yet popular film star. Both Radha and Aradhana are strong personalities who know what they want out of life. On the other hand, Govind, Krissh and Javed are all arrogant smart-Alecks. It’s amazing then that Priyanka Chopra and Shahid Kapoor manage to emote with a wide variety and bring some flavor to their three almost similar characters. I especially enjoyed what Shahid Kapoor does with Javed. Prachi Desai in her short presence leaves you feeling for her, more so because of the way she portrays the way her character faces the truth. Neha Sharma annoys well as the ‘typical girlfriend’ character. The rest of the supporting cast has nothing that makes you notice them, but I just don’t get why such awful actors are chosen to play the British officers.The period setting of the 1950s is cute – it doesn’t look authentic at all, but the textile industry from the times when Phoneix Mills was actually a mill does give you a flavor of the era. So does Shahid Kapoor’s  tribute to Charlie Chaplin and Kunal Kohli’s tribute to the silent era. On the other hand the culture depicted from those times in terms of say how a girl would behave in a small village in the 1910s or dress in a Bombay chawl in the 1950s is very difficult to digest. And lovely poetry aside, is nothing sacred about the freedom struggle – an energetic, completely romantic  song in the middle of a jail!? Really?There is no difficulty on the other hand in accepting the role technology plays in romance of the 2010s. Neither is it difficult to accept the nastiness of the woman scorned. Bits engage you; parts make you smile, laugh and LOL; and many chunks make you wonder why this film couldn’t be at least a little different from just three love stories hurriedly put together.

That's all there is to say about it.,"All I'd have liked to say about Tevar is that it is a typical action masala film. It's up to you what to make of it. If you like the kind of action where story is ancillary and more a matter of convenience than the core of the film, then you will enjoy this one. If not, you won't. It is in fact as simple as that.Given the film's title, by default, every character in the film carries an attitude about them, including the villain's sidekick. Except, except the lead lady. She is one who needs constant protection and taking care of. The tiny bit of attitude that she is allowed to carry for one-tenth of a second is instantaneously over-powered by someone else's attitude. The one-liner boy meets girl story has an extension - boy meets girl when she is running away from a crazy and powerful thus dangerous admirer. You would think that the extension adds just the right amount of salt and pepper to give you a decent film. But, all this is a set-up for the other kind of masala. The one which has random fist and sword fights; some long and some longer chases and a few songs to complete the circle. Though conceptually, the romance seems to be central to the plot, in reality it just feels like a fallback option, ""if we don't have them fall in love with each other, what will we do? What will they do?"" Fortunately, the actors themselves take their jobs seriously. Arjun Kapoor says his dialogue with a way too much style for my taste, but then that is what the title of the film demands. I like this avatar of Sonakshi Sinha better than her boisterous, loud-mouthed version in this genre of films. What would really be nice though, is she break through to something completely different. We will wait for that film. Manoj Bajpai, as expected, is in complete element as the eccentric, egomaniac, obsessed lover. Unfortunately, it is not because how well the character is written. It is only his doing and commitment to the character. But, it is blatant. It can be considered as a positive - that a film is very aware that it is not trying very hard to tell a story as much as it wants to show some action and that is pretty much its purpose. It doesn't quite work for me though.Which is why, Tevar is one of those. Those who want to like it, will enjoy it come what may. Others can fret and fume all they like.

Sloppy visual effects, lamest lines of all, a bizarre plot which wishes that I empathize with an anti-hero who threatens to blast trains don't make a couple of good chase sequences worth it. And you meet some of the most unplanned terrorists on the way. ","Tezz makes your brain go numb - with loud action sequences that accompany shoddy VFX, with its inane dialogue, with content that is mind-bogglingly dim-witted. An illegal immigrant gets so offended for being thrown out of UK that he comes back to threaten, takes along other illegal immigrants  to blow a couple of trains off and make demands of the government!? And the hope is that the his backstory is going to make the audience see the justification behind the actions of this ""anti-hero""?! Even if a part of the audience, like me, thinks of Aakash Rana (Ajay Devgan) more as a villain than an anti-hero, he's not loathsome enough to make Tezz watchable. And it is a huge disappointment in that villains who aren't absolutely nasty have such potential to make interesting characters. But here, Aakash seems as misguided as the writers, assuming there were writers involved in this project.Yep! Beginning to complain about the plot holes implies that there was a coherent plot. All I know is, if I start filling in the 'didn't work' section of the notepad in the opening sequence of a film, the next two hours are pretty much written off. While the film is more or less one chase sequence after the other - some of them well-choreographed, others interrupted by childish graphics and special effects - you wish text on screen said 'The End' when it reads 'Interval'. None of the main characters have roles that require too much emoting or even speaking - the latter is a good thing. Especially, when the potential speakers are the likes of Kangna Ranaut who made me cringe at her diction even for the two lines that she had. Actually both, she and Sameera Reddy, can barely be called ""lead"" characters. Of the lot, in fact Boman Irani followed by Anil Kapoor get some screen space that allows for at least some expressions. But, then they have such awful lines, that you wish they hadn't taken this film in the first place. Then you have the songs that are as out of place even if someone somewhere tried to justify it with some convoluted reason. Mallika Sherawat's 'laila' must be one of the worst choreographed and picturised item numbers of recent times. Tezz gives a weird sense of disappointment - the kind that you get even when you weren't expecting anything half-decent to begin with.

But when the film sets out to express itself, what clearly could be and had been registered through the visuals gets re-registered again and again till one feels nauseated by the events. ","A movie is often considered a symphony of the audio & visual medium; and sure enough the auteurs have always striven to tread on a path between the said & the unsaid in order to keep us in a trance. To achieve that feat in Thandavam, a self-proclaimed unusual revenge saga of a blind man, A L Vijay employs everything in the rule book & that could precisely be the reason for its inability to interest us.Looking at Thandavam on the whole, the crucial problem with the film clearly lies in its immature treatment. Sure the premise of the action thriller is something even an infrequent film viewer would appreciate. But when the film sets out to express itself, what clearly could be and had been registered through the visuals gets re-registered again and again till one feels nauseated by the events. As this redundancy gradually distances the audience for the silver screen, the age old formulas to invoke emotions becomes too tiresome & juvenile to warrant our attention. Close to the release of the film, a trailer was released by the Thandavam team. Splashed all over the media, it started off with a song sequence followed by a caption stating ‘a love story’. It was then followed by snippets of the film’s different scenes with subsequent captions like ‘a story of friendship’, ‘family story’, ‘revenge story’, ‘fun story’, etc; and at the end of the trailer, they claimed it to be ‘a complete entertainer’. As any Actor Vijay or Salman Khan film goes by, the trailer simply displayed varied ideas and values like how the 27 states displays its props during the Independence Day parade. As demeaning as it could be to call it entertainment, the trailer otherwise is a perfect showcase for what the film stands for.  The film begins as action thriller interlaced with unintentional comedy, at the midpoint of which it discards that & becomes a complete romantic film. Long past the expiry date of the romance when the movie limps towards the end, it suddenly gets the urge to be a revenge saga again. All this while the main selling point of the film that the protagonist is a visually impaired person, is used only as a second rate prop. With such obscurity looming large on the screen, one wonders who really is the visually impaired – the writer or the protagonist.

Anees Bazmee is not that one. It's not the cheating that bothers me as it is the crassness and the way my mind goes numb for hours after watching such films. So, I actually looped with joy when there was no line at the online ticket counter. And the queue for current tickets was empty too! (I promise this had nothing to do with ample parking space available.)  An almost empty theater - die senseless films, die! And just before the film started I said, ""come on Mr. Bazmee, make me regret my happiness."" Nope not this time.It's weird because the concept and where it's leading gives you the sense that it is anti-man and pro-woman. But, could it be any more derogatory to women if all main leads of the film have only one use for the fairer gender? Also, it wasn't comforting at all that only a man could bring a solution to all the women's problems. I'm no feminist (at least in the popular sense of the term) and don't mind seeing women as they are. But, a woman is either super-gullible or a piece of pretty furniture, seriously? We don't really expect much in terms of acting from Celina Jaitley and actually she isn't on screen long enough to prove either way. Don’t look at me boys, forward your complaints to Azmee. Sonam Kapoor still comes across as Bollywood's bachchi (kiddo), because the directors seem to be giving her one emotion per film. In this one she's made an unsuccessful attempt at sobbing to try and gain our sympathy. We are a desensitized lot, Baby Kapoor, you need to try harder and it better be quick, we aren't very patient either. And Rimi Sen can't blame herself. We have seen some awesome comic timing from her. She tries a fair bit here too, it just doesn't work. Well, if Irrfan Khan doesn't work, what else can? It's almost as if the director didn't want his actors to perform well. Suniel Shetty does the slapsticky bit (he made me laugh a couple of times) and Bobby Deol does the Bobby Deoly bit. Yes. That's it. That's all I have to say. Yes. That's my attempt at refusing to acknowledge any other ""star"" in the film who continues to assault my intelligence and gets support to do it again and again and again. This is my sign of 'non-support'.

Even if what she is looking for is an image of a father she's never had and always wanted. Whether or not she finds the father is as important as what she goes through to find him. The gritty nature of the film and the subject is not something all of us can handle for it takes guts to accept the truth about the society that we are a part of. It's an important film but not one I'd want to watch again.,"That Girl In Yellow Boots isn't a film you can enjoy. It's dark and forthright film, making it an uncomfortable watch. It makes you care for its protagonist and you don't want bad things to happen to her even as you see her make herself go through horrible actions. You feel worse for her because she goes about the moral evils from bribery to sexual acts, in a very matter-of-fact manner. (which also means, you don't watch the film with either your kids or your parents!) Anyway, you can see through her immorality from the things she refuses to do. She's street-smart; she has found her way around mean-machine Mumbai even though she's from UK. And yet you know she's fragile under that cold stare. The writer dug so deep into this one character, that we know her. And that has to be the beauty of an actor being the writer of the story. Kalki Koechlin knows her character Ruth so well, that she takes no time in convincing us that hers is a story that needs to be heard. It also needs to be heard because of the taboo subject it approaches. A topic that needs to be talked about liberally, but is wrapped under covers making the victim feel guilty. In fact, had Ruth's family talked about it, we wouldn't have had this film. (Funny this, I can't talk about it here, because I'll be giving the movie away :)) About ninety out of the hundred minutes are spent with Ruth, trying to find her father. And yet, you don't get bored. That's because of the bunch of characters that Ruth encounters, tolerates and gets past. Almost as if telling us, that the life lessons she is learning will make her a stronger person. And somehow it will all be worth it. From Chitiappa Gauda (Gulshan Devaiya) the much-needed comic relief in the form of a goon to Prashant, Ruth's drug-dealer boyfriend (Prashant Prakash). Amidst this mix of common but not-so-normal characters played by new actors is the reassuring presence of a father figure and familiar face of Naseeruddin Shah. Of course, the fact that I remember the character as Naseeruddin Shah is a tiny failure. But, not a folly that gets overwhelming.Sure, there are a couple of times when the repetitiveness begins to get at you. But at that exact time, a character in the film tells off the annoying character. Bottom line is the film engages you throughout. The dialogue is smart and the delivery by one and all is perfect. I also like how the characters unfold. We come to know about them through the things they do and how they interact. I'm sure most directors would have chosen the voiceover route. This is not the kind of Anurag Kashyap film we are used to. That Girl In Yellow Boots is subtler and calmer. He's not rushing to make his point as if he's not sure he'll get another chance to make it. His angst against the society which wouldn't allow his kind of films to be made has settled a bit. And that has only added to the overall package that the film is. That doesn't mean it doesn't shock you like a trademark Anurag Kashyap film. The ""shock therapy"" could be held against him, but there are some facts about vermin in our society that cannot be told without shocking. Even though I guessed the climax, because of one passing line Ruth says somewhere in the middle of the film, the climax shook me a bit. It could be just because I didn't want it to be how Ruth's story ended. An issue that is close-to-heart, a cold portrayal of the world, and the straightforward as-is style made me uncomfortable, which is a big plus for the film because that was its intention. Yet, unlike other Anurag Kashyap films that I'd urge you to try even if they are not your type, I won't be able to recommend That Girl In Yellow Boots. Because ironically, That Girl In Yellow Boots is not for those who are looking for happy endings.

453,1153,1153,1153,1153,The Adventures of Tintin - The Secret of the Unicorn,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review4 Reader Reviews 5/5.0 20 Tweet Reviews 4.6/5.0,/movie/adventures-tintin-review/,,5/5.0,4.6/5.0,4.4,"The Adventures of Tintin, directed by Steven Spielberg, is a visual treat for lovers of animation films and fans of the comic book series. Though the story isn’t particularly great, the character quirks and perhaps the best animation seen to date ensure that the film keeps you entertained. The iconic comic book characters are brought to life in a way that the big screen hasn’t yet experienced. The dialogue will make you smile, and the action set pieces are thoroughly enjoyable. Purely for its visual appeal, this is a film that you might just enjoy on the big screen with family and friends.","When a little middle-class boy with big dreams in his eyes proclaims that he wants to make films, the first gentle rebuke he will probably hear is, ‘So, you want to be Spielberg?’ Such is the influence of the man – a man praised and criticized in equal measure. However, irrespective of which side of the fence you are on, there is no denying that few men have had the kind of influence on any facet of human history, as Steven Spielberg has had in the field of audio-visual entertainment. Spielberg’s latest, The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, is exactly that - an entertaining  film that is perhaps the closest that a big-screen adaptation has come so far, in capturing the essence of some of the most endearing and enduring comic book characters of all time.That Tintin, Captain Haddock, Snowy, and of course, Thomson and Thompson will bring a smile on your face is a given. Their quirks, their dialogue and their ‘unquenchable thirst for adventure’ have been brought alive by producers Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson in a revolutionary new way.Motion capture combined with incredible detailing in VFX brings the animation to life in a manner never seen before. Every reflection, every droplet of water, every tiny movement of human hair is unbelievably life-like. Only the characters’ faces (and at times their actions) betray that what one is viewing is indeed animation.Be it an incredible mid-sea battle amidst a raging inferno or a superb bike chase through the streets and homes of Morocco, the film is riddled with enthralling set-pieces that will make more than a few jaws drop. The film is rich in colour and more importantly, it is rich in atmosphere – something that goes a long way in sucking the audience in to the story. John Williams’ music score more than plays its part in enriching the atmosphere that the film manages to create.While the 3D in this film isn’t as big a waste as it has been in so many films, one still suspects that watching the film in 2D will not detract from the visual experience in any way. If anything, the colours are bound to be richer once the dark glasses are off.The department that the film suffers the most in is the script. The mystery itself isn’t as mysterious as one would have liked. The twists and turns are there, but there is really nothing that will make you sit at the idiomatic edge of your seat. However, the quirkiness of the characters, particularly Captain Haddock, makes up in part for the deficiencies in the script. The characters keep you entertained at all times.Yes, that aspect which Spielberg is criticized the most for is present all over this film – the manner in which it is moralistically sanitized. The edginess, the layers, the nuances of real human behavior and the shades of grey that someone who is not a Tintin or an animation fan would want are noticeably absent. This is the one area where this film would fall behind iconic Pixar films like Finding Nemo, Toy Story and Wall-E. Ultimately, The Adventures of Tintin is an entertaining film for children as well as adults, particularly those who enjoy animation. The realistic animation is a visual treat, and there would be few who would not feel an adrenaline rush at least once during the film. Make no mistake, as far as animation technique in cinema is concerned, the envelope has been pushed. Even we who feel that audio-visual entertainment and cinema are often worlds apart would have to agree.

However, he brings to the film an emotional and comic sentimentality that allows one to walk with Andrew Garfield, as Peter Parker, through his journey. You laugh with him, have a lump in your throat as he cries and sit on the edge during his action sequences. This makes The Amazing Spider-Man a novel and stirring viewing experience inspite of the storyline being more or less the same. ","For those of you who still remember Sam Raini’s Spiderman trilogy vividly, (considering the last film was out barely 5 years ago) Marc Webb’s The Amazing Spider-Man (director of well-acclaimed indie film 500 Days of Summer) might not have anything new to offer in the larger picture. But don’t we all love superhero films for its portrayal of the underdog-nerd who turns into a crime-fighter? While The Amazing Spider-Man doesn’t toy with the basic graph of the film, it has enough to grab your attention and ensure a thrilling, enjoyable viewing experience.The story is more or less the same: Of a gawky-lanky Peter Parker as he discovers that he is meant for greater things. After many years of questioning his parent’s mysterious disappearance, we are shown his warm surroundings with Uncle Ben and Aunt May (played by the charming Martin Sheen and Sally Field). He then encounters his father’s former partner Dr Curt Connor’s (Rhys Ifans) genius genetic research and lends a missing algorithm to complete the research.By then he’s already been bitten by the spider, and is trying to grapple with his superpowers. He’s also going through a teenage puppy infatuation with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Their chemistry is much more developed and crackling, which is a vast difference from the sense of achievement that you feel with Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst’s (from previous Spiderman films) heart-warming union. It works, regardless of the differences, because of their performances. Emma Stone is sparkling and plays the kind of girl that young boys write sonnets about (or at least the poetically inclined ones). It makes their coming together that much more magical because their chemistry has a solid build up, devoid of any meant-to-be-together undertones. Rhys Ifans as the Lizard is menacing; although you recognize the need for a more sinister villain. The scenes between Spiderman and the lizard are visually gripping though, mostly due to John Schwatrzman’s swift cinematography and James Horner’s grand-crescendo type background score.Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker is a more nervy, nerdy teenager which works extremely well in this re-telling because the film becomes a coming of age story more than anything. While he’s not a spectacled, dorky nerd, he plays the part of an outsider (the kind that prefers his skateboard to actual human company) with precision. It’s the kind of performance where you’re nearly expecting him to collapse with the pressure he attains after successfully transforming into Spiderman, but you know his sense of responsibility is large (You don’t miss the iconic line, “With great power comes great responsibility”, and that is a big win for writers James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves)The Amazing Spider-Man works, mostly because of the minor nuances that have been paid attention to, to make for a fresh viewing. Be it in Parker and Gwen Stacy’s smile-inducing chemistry, a brief viewing of Parker’s parents, the homemade costume and the fact that the spider-web in this film is web-made as opposed to the organic web from Raini’s Spiderman - all only add to the charm of the film. You’re able to watch the film without making compulsive comparisons to the earlier films and you’re able to love it all the same. For that reason, The Amazing Spider-Man is a must watch.

Still, there's some fun to be had if you don't mind a lot of romance and backstory along the way.","Wait, another Spiderman film is back already? Well, yes it is. The sequel to the reboot of the adaptation is in theatres, and it is as winded as this sentence. When the fortuitously named Marc Webb helmed the first film of this series, one felt that Spidey was in safe hands. With this film, you won't change your mind just yet, but no one will judge you if you pause for a quick rethink. Heavy on romance, pauses and nothingness, but also sprinkled with some amount of action (not to mention tongue-in-cheek humour), The Amazing Spiderman 2 continues in the same vein as its predecessor, which essentially means that it will entertain a few, bore some others, and leave the rest waiting for the next big Marvel film (X-Men: Days of Future Past, which is just around the corner!)Interestingly enough, that firecracker of a lady, Emma Stone, is the best thing about this enterprise, as she lights up the screen with her Gwen Stacy everytime she shows up. She more than makes up for a rather rough-around-the-edges Andrew Garfield, who seems in his element only in the Spandex Spidey suit, where you can't see him emote anyway. In fact, considering how much time Marc Webb spends on the Gwen-Peter romance in this film, you almost wonder if he was making a film called, say, 500 Days of Gwen.That isn't to say that the romance isn't sweet; it quite is. Still, you spend way too much time waiting for Electro (and the Green Goblin; and Rhino) to show up, and when they do, you're served with action that isn't quite as imaginative as you'd have hoped. True, Spiderman has clearly gotten the hang of webslinging now that he's into his second film, but you can't just resort to showing cars stopping mid-air just above an innocent victim's head all the time.  Electro's backstory is treated with kindergarten naiveté, and is another subplot that is devoted longer screen time than it deserved. When he does eventually show up, he does the bright and shiny things you expect him to do, set to an unusually screeching background score. The action set-pieces between him and Spiderman are more fun for the chemistry between the characters, than for any actual brilliance in execution.What you're left with are a few periodic smart-ass one liners from Spiderman, and a gut-wrenching climax; albeit one which fans of the Spiderman comics would have been expecting anyway. Expectedly, tantalising hints about the villains in future films are present in this one.What it boils down to, then, is this: Like the first film, this one too has Spiderman play out a scene with a little boy. The point of these scenes, I suppose, is to bring out the hope that Spiderman instills into the hearts of those who believe. It is that hope that will have people waiting for the next film with equal eagerness. There isn't much of that hope that this current film can stake claim over, though.

456,1156,1156,1156,1156,The Artist,Owner's Pride!,wogma review,/movie/artist-review/,,,,4.066666667,"If you answer this question – How do two heavily French-accented actors pull off a silent film as a homage to the cinema of the 1920s – with an, “Wow, I have to find out”, you know The Artist has won its battle. Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo play George Valentin and Peppy Miller; the most charming lead pair you’d have come across in a while. Watch the film for its ability to make you feel nostalgic and genuinely smile, at almost every second. ","It’s a bit overwhelming to write a review of a film that has won 3 Academy awards barely 4 hours ago. Every person around me is throwing their opinions on The Artist – ""Did it deserve 3 awards?"" ""How it’s preposterous that so-and-so did not watch the film over the weekend."" ""How it’s actually an overrated rom-com""
 and the likes. While the Academy awards usually bring about healthy debates post its early morning broadcast, this year The Artist has been favored by most. Allow me to reason out why. The Artist is set during the mid-1920s. The plot seems adapted from films like Sunset Boulevard and Singin’ in the Rain (which talks about the rise and fall of a silent superstar with the introduction of the talkies), but where the The Artist stands out is in its lead pair’s ability to convince you that you’re actually back in the day. Not once does it give you the feeling of watching a homage film and primarily for that, The Artist holds your complete attention in its first 5 minutes. Jean Dujardin plays George Valentin, a famous silent star with the charming smile. It’s one of those pre-requisites that the lead actors walked around with: a charming smile, a thin mustache, a tap-dancing ability and you’re good to go. In Valentin’s case, he also has a pet dog, Uggy, who remains faithful to him till the last breath of the film (admittedly also my favorite character in the film, as he reminds me so much of Odie from the Garfield series). Anyhow, Valentin bumps into Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) at a movie and they have a moment. What follows reminds me severely of a scene in The Social Network
The Social Network, Eduardo mentions how Sean Parker made his biggest contribution to Facebook by excluding the ‘The’. Valentin in all his star wisdom adds a mole above Miller’s lip with a pencil. It’s this same mole that takes her places, that turns her into a superstar just when talkies have started to trend.We then see the fall of Valentin, his charming smile stands as nothing compared to the epidemic of hearing one’s favorite superstar speak. Every dramatic emotion is played out beautifully with orchestrated background music – from Valentin’s silent fears manifested in his dreams, to his tragic loss of fame as compared to Miller’s instant shot at success. And yet, every time they both appear on screen you wonder when all troubles will come to an end, and when life will only be about the dances. Berenice Bejo is downright lovable; you can see why the audiences adore her. She appeals to all also because she’s not the typical poofed-blonde-hair, curvaceous, uptight heroine (although a rarity now). Peppy Miller, on the other hand gives every woman who aspires to be a Hollywood star the permission to dream. The real winners of The Artist, then are not Dujardin and Bejo but the characters George Valentin and Peppy Miller, because together they make you fall in love with the movies. They make you forget you’re being told a story that is not new, and make you concentrate on the medium that is being chosen to tell it. Together they make you believe no matter what the mode The Artist, cannot be made without a charming lead pair. Where The Artist holds a disadvantage is addressing an audience that is so used to verbosity. It does tend to drag a bit, in parts where you have managed to overcome the awe of experiencing a silent film. That is so because even in similarly plotted films, the medium is contemporary and the silent era is only being referred to and discussed. Whereas, The Artist uses the very same medium to tell its story – the 4:3 aspect ratio reminds us of noisy projectors through which the movies were screened, glow lighting that created a unreal halo around the superstar of the film and heavily orchestrated music that serves as your cue to emote. For its sheer courage and innovation then, you willingly keep debates and speculation on hold, and MUST watch The Artist on the big screen – because anything else would be a crime. But more importantly because The Artist makes you fall in love with the movies all over again.

And can we face their terror with anything but helplessness? A little tact, a few fumbles. A little beyond the obvious, a few facts edited/changed. ","""What...are these people? What kind of hatred...is this?"" Jt Commissioner Maria (Nana Patekar) is as baffled by the inconceivable ruthlessness of the 26/11 attacks as we were on 26 November, 2008. In another scene he's seeking help from the Central Government while the attacks are on, and his helplessness comes through with an exasperated, ""I don't know what to do."" The thought behind these two sentences reverberate within, even before they have been said out loud. The large space between these lines is what makes any terrorist attack what it is. Its attempt to address these lines is what makes The Attacks of 26/11 a movie worth watching. Unprepared, untrained, unequipped - that's how any police force would be when facing a terror attack of this nature. It's not that nothing should be done to prepare, train and equip ourselves better, but an attack without any tip, is bound to catch local law enforcement off-guard - people walking around with limitless ammunition, willing to kill or die. Just like when an airplane crashes into a building or several cases of serial bombing. The first half numbs you with episodes of the 26/11 attacks one after another. In this half though, weird camera angles, ridiculous focus on various statues (Laughing Buddha being the favorite!), loud screeching violins in the background - all annoy and distract. But the content is so close to home that you can mostly ignore them. The body count too seems exaggerated, be it at CST station or at the Taj Hotel (even if the film uses the Taj lobby as a symbol of all who died or were injured in all other places on that day.) But, throughout you make small connects with people who you could care for - children of course, but police officers and regular by-standers. The connect is obviously because it could have been you or me or someone we know. And Ram Gopal Verma appropriately cashes in on this connect, even if with little finesse. Whether or not the film would be more human, more engaging, if in the hands of another director - I don't want to know. In fact, that issue remains throughout. Am I connecting with the film because of the characters and how the film is narrated or is it inherent with my connect to the incident itself? Unfortunately, this is something I will never be able to answer. And this will work in the film's favor forever. Also, I am sure there are many unsung heroes in this incident that didn't make their way into the film. Surely, there are many changes and additions to the events to provide for that bit of drama needed to make a story into a film. Way too many times in the first half, you wonder, ""How do they know that happened?"" because everyone involved died. Also, the film covers only the events of 26/11 and not the two days after. Yet, that is the cinematic liberty we can allow to a maker who is trying to go beyond just the occurrences of this one event. The second half has two main scenes which bring about a balance that I didn't think a film on this event could bring about. It would be safe to say that we as a nation are not in the mood to understand the psyche of the terrorist who has the audacity of holding one of our cities at ransom. So, to try to bring about a sermon setting the right from the wrong might be considered a cop-out or brave; filmy or wise - depending on what your stand is. Surprisingly, I found myself in awe of (lapping up) Jt Commissioner Maria's word-for-word, thought-for-thought, concept-for-concept response in his spiel. All credit to some awesome dialogue writing and an overpowering dialogue delivery. Not to mention, the thought behind the said monologue, resonates with my attitude towards any strong religious sentiment used out of context and as a justification for hideous acts. Someone said it out loud. It doesn't matter then whether or not the Jt Commissioner actually had such a conversation in real life. Here the director is talking to us, the citizens of this country. And maybe he hopes to reach out to the oddball Jihadi who ends up watching his film. And if that does happen, the manner in which it is done reaches the viewer's gut and Nana Patekar's performance in that one scene could be enough to warrant a watch. What a relief it is to see him not resort to his typical style, but take a more restrained route. Even without the monologue, one shot where he is offered water shows you he needs no histrionics for a good performance. Here, the close-ups are used brilliantly.Sanjeev Jaiswal as Kasab induces enough hatred to not want to watch him in any other film again. Then again, that is more because the character is not fictional. Only a few more films will determine whether or not he is a good actor. For now, that the audience was restless whenever he was on screen and abused strongly shows that he didn't goof up.Despite all that was good about the film, it is difficult to shake off the disgust felt when I heard that director, Ram Gopal Verma had visited the site of the attacks the day after. Insensitive of him, irresponsible of the people who allowed it to happen. The negativity that his visit had brought about, will stay forever and will always be a black mark against his product. Yet, such films are important. If not to remind us of the difference between the fundamentals of religion and being a fundamentalist, to remind us of questions we should not stop asking our resilient selves, ""Are our shores secure today?""

I could overhear Marvel comic fans discussing the move rigorously during the interval, and surprisingly, I also overheard a bunch of new-comers talk about how they’re going to buy the comics and read up on the film. We all collectively, however, walked out of the theatre starving for more. Don’t miss The Avengers!","Forgive me as I’ve not been an avid reader of the Marvel comics, so this review might be one of just the film. That said, I found myself hooting, cheering, laughing out loud and enjoying every minute of The Avengers, without being the comic-book fan. I did, however, read up at length about each character and their graph before the film, but even without a background study, The Avengers is a must-watch: for sheer indulgence into a world that is action-packed, entertaining and thrilling all at once. The Avengers intertwine the lives of previous superheroes (with their own movies): Captain America, Thor, Iron Man and Hulk. With Black Widow (Scarlett Johanssen) and Hawk-Eye (Jeremy Renner), they are brought together to prevent an event of global danger. Our heroes (and heroine) are tracking down the Tesseract, a cube of cosmic super-power, which was also present in the movies Iron Man 2, Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor. The Tesseract has landed itself in the wrong hands of Loki (Tom Hiddleson), the film’s wily villain and also Thor’s step-brother. Loki’s intentions are clear - to rule to world and subjugate as King. Director of the secret international peace-keeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D, Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) is worried and desperate. He rounds our super-heroes to save the world from this feudal monster – and it’s a cliché that works superbly. It holds you, makes you sit on the tiny, uncomfortable edge of the seat and rejoice/scream/cheer. The film takes no time to establish each super-hero, and through the film makes sure every characteristic of the heroes are brought in. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is sassy and suave as ever, Chris Evans as Captain America is brave and confused as the defiant World War II veteran.  The new entrants are as charming: Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk fits the part to a T, and Scarlett Johansson plays the sly Russian Spy Black Widow incorporating her personal flair to the character. Oh, but you spend roughly 10 mins of the film analyzing the characters. Before you know it, you are picked up from your seat and taken on the epic adventure that these Avengers take. Director Joss Whedon maintains an engaging pace, while the film shifts between blasting action sequences and witty repartee between characters. Ofcourse Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is at the fore-front of the humor, but surprisingly every character follows through. You are given enough moments in the film to laugh out loud and generally, have a good time. It’s a balance that has been struck to perfection. Although the plot-line is formulaic and a tad bit predictable, the film does leave you spontaneously wide-eyed with its compelling chemistry between each character and the witty-dialogue/grand-action routine. The Avengers is a mammoth spectacle. And yet, in retrospect you don’t feel deceived by an overdose of mindless action. Each character holds their own in the film, and is therefore a treat for those who prefer one particular character over another (Iron Man!). The 3D version adds to the grandeur of the film, with fluid camera work, you feel like a part of an adrenaline-pumped videogame. At 146 mins, The Avengers is worth every minute of your time.

459,1159,1159,1159,1159,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/best-exotic-marigold-hotel-review/,,,,3.6,"On their first visit to India, Judy Dench’s character, who also plays the narrator of the film, describes her feeling with an extremely apt line: “An assault of the senses”. Director John Madden shows us a clichéd, but comfortable India filled with colors, sounds and a large handful of people, but also manages to strike a chord with the stories of the seven characters. Watch The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for its performances and a well-written unfolding of intertwining stories. ","Youth is celebrated in the Hindi film industry – where else would you find 40-year-old actors, play college-going students? It’s an industry where a female actor is gracefully expected to retire from being a heroine at the age of 35, tops. In contrast to this, what strikes most about The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is that the movie involves the unfolding on the lives of seven elderly British people and their journey to India. For its abashed take on human experience, regardless of age, The Best Exotic Marigold is a delightful watch.The film begins with an introduction of characters, and spends not more than a fast-paced minute or two to wittily describe their current lives. It’s a concoction of a cast that you assume (correctly so), cannot go wrong. The ensemble includes Judy Dench as a newly widowed housewife, Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilkin, a married couple of 40 years, Maggie Smith as an uptight ex-housekeeper, Tom Wilkinson as an ex-court Judge, Ronald Pickup (true to his name) as wannabe Casanova longing for companionship and Celia Imrie as a hopeful husband hunter. They all find themselves on a flight to Jaipur to a hotel/retreat for the “Elderly and the Beautiful” – where they meet an effervescent Sonny (Dev Patel), the manager of the hotel who tries to sell the dusty, out of order place as an upcoming palace. Evidently, their hopes and dreams of an exciting old-age experience is on the brink of shattering. We see the film take a route of discovery; an interesting mix of self-discovery and a sense of wonder and amazement towards this culture shock. Director, John Madden is able to place the personal stories and the wide array of public experiences with a captivating sense of visual beauty. Within the first half of the film, you get absorbed into the lives of these characters; even Patel’s life as the manager of the hotel; he has his own baggage. You find yourself hoping the Hotel will have a makeover soon, and that it looks as beautiful as Patel’s Shakespearean mumbling to potential financers. Soon, you find yourself falling in love with the surroundings, even though the choice to portray an ever-Indian aspect in the film is largely clichéd (with stress on the heat, stench, over-population, and our obsessive curiosity towards foreigners), you find that an effort has been made. The background score through the film is overwhelming, with its soothing classical Hindustani tones. Most of all, it’s a relief to see the Indians in the film talk in Hindi and not with an accented English. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is not a fast-paced film with too much to absorb – it allows you to slowly take in every experience that the characters are experiencing, and every visual that over-powers them. The Indian clichés are calming, and remind you of surrounding that you are used to. Sometimes, the film does ponder over a situation for far too long, trying to bring out the abstract beauty of the scene, but for the most part, the performances, profound dialogue and comical/wondrous perspective of India make the film a worth-while watch.

The Big Lebowski reveals much about the Coen Brothers’ penchant for making films that stand out because of the comically dark treatment of their stories. With near-iconic characters that stay with you much after you’ve watched the film, it’ll surely make you go, “Dude, what in the world was that?” A word of warning: The film may just convert you to Dudeism – try googling that. ","Every once in a while comes a film that clearly demarcates its success into extremes. It’ll bomb at the box office and no more than a couple of years later you’ll see it gaining immense cult status. Films like 
Blue Velvet, 
Reservoir Dogs and, closer to home, Andaz Apna Apna, failed at the box office but gathered fans through their home video releases. Some films are destined to be a bigger success through underground appreciation. If the filmmakers got a penny for every time someone highly recommended these films over a casual conversation, they’d be calling themselves James Cameron. And that’s the beauty of watching a film like The Big Lebowski.Even though Fargo  and No Country For Old Men  are considered the gems, The Big Lebowski adds to their credit like a trigger. From the casting to the dialogues to the surrealistic depiction of what can only be summed up as being inside a stoner’s head, the entire experience makes you go “whaaaa?” in a salutary way. The film surrounds Jeffery Lebowski (Jeff Bridges, also 2010’s Best Actor Academy Award winner) or the Dude as he refers to himself and prefers everyone to refer to him as. He gets caught up in a series of events because he shares his name with a millionaire. All of it is hilarious because here’s a bowling enthusiast who couldn’t be happier smoking weed, drinking White Russians and calling himself a pacifist, who gets unnecessarily involved in a tumbling situation. Accompanying him are his two friends, John Goodman (Walter Sobchak), a Vietnam veteran and Donny (Steve Buscemi) his bowling mate. The best part about the film is the funny and edgy nature of the characters. Goodman is everything the Dude is not, with a violent temper and his willingness to settle everything with a gun. Donny is thick-headed and gullible, and they provide for admirable side characters for someone like the Dude. Apart from these three, you have Julianne Moore playing a feminist artist, Tara Reid playing a nymphomaniac wife, Philip Hoffman playing a secretary who acts as the mediator between the two Lebowskis and the sassiest of the lot, with his Italian mafia-esque accent and loud dressing, John Turturro. Referred to as Jesus, Turturro (one of the Coen brothers’ stock actors) plays a bowling opponent to the Dude and his friends. Each character has been depicted with a hilarious background score, and all of them come together to make for a series of bizarre, amusing scenes. Also watch out for the cowboy narrator who refers to the story as some age-old legend, with epic characters. The special features on the DVD are not that exciting, apart from a set of photographs by Jeff Bridges and a 25 minute making of The Big Lebowski. Also featuring are short interviews with Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, and of course Coen staples Steve Buscemi and John Turturro. But if you need one reason to go buy the DVD, it is the fact that a whole religion has emerged out of a character from the film. Dudeism is now a full-blown religion, with Dudeist churches and priests spread across the US, all advocating The Dude’s philosophy and lifestyle. Dude, now that is cult status!

Michael Oher is a 17-year-old black boy brought up in foster care all his life before he finds home at the Tuohys. With amazingly touching performances from Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron, this film is bound to make you cry.","The Blind Side is a real-life drama about Michael Oher, a football player and his struggles from being an abandoned kid growing up in foster homes to an NFL player. Starring Quinton Aaron as Oher and Sanra Bullock as his adoptive mother, the film has been nominated for Oscars in the Best Actress and the Best Film category.What makes The Blind Side such a compelling movie is the fact that it tells a true-life story of a boy with little or no prospects. The Blind Side however, is not just another underdog movie. It is a film about human relationships, the need to reach out to the ones less fortunate, but most importantly, it's a film about believing in oneself and following one’s convictions even when the whole world might be booing you. The fact that the film is a real-life story makes it an even more compelling narrative. During its two-hour run, the screenplay of The Blind Side shows no signs of flagging; nor does it get into unnecessary details even when there are at least a quarter dozen stories that are dying to be told. Instead, writer-director John Lee Hancock chooses to focus on one and one story only -- that of Michael Oher. Everyone else’s personal tales fade out in comparison. Sandra Bullock who plays Leigh Anne Tuohy surely does a great job. But if there is someone who the Academy has left out it is Quinton Aaron, the six-feet something huge actor who has played the role of the underdog with such conviction your heart goes out to him. In the first part of the movie you see him with just a polythene bag -- the kinds you use for buying fish -- and set of clothes on his back spending nights at the Laundromat or the gym simply ‘because it’s warm in there’. Believe me there is nothing more heart-wrenching than those scenes. Last year the Academy took note of a somewhat unknown actor Richard Jenkins and his role in a little-known film called The Visitor and nominated him in the Best Actor category alongside Sean Penn and Brad Pitt. Looking at this year’s nomination list you wonder why Aaron never made it to any of the categories. We all know what a wonderful actress Sandra Bullock is -- she’s given us very many memorable films over the years. But if you must watch The Blind Side, watch it for the performance of Quinton Aaron.

462,1162,1162,1162,1162,The Bourne Ultimatum,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma reviewNotepad1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/the-bourne-ultimatum-review/,,5/5.0,,3.6,,"After the considerable success of The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, it’s time for the third film in the series - The Bourne Ultimatum. Thankfully, it’s arguably the best so far.Where Ultimatum really comes into its own is the sheer pace at which the story unfolds. Director Paul Greengrass maintains an extremely high tempo throughout the movie. As Bourne attempts to keep one step ahead of his pursuers, Greengrass employs generous helpings of handheld camera shots and ultra-quick cuts to keep up the breathless ride. Every now and again, he’ll give the audience a few minutes’ respite, before revving up again.And Bourne certainly gets around. Even as the plot races through Moscow, Paris, London, Madrid, Tangiers and New York, each city is given room to shine. The Waterloo Station and Tangiers scenes are particularly memorable. Damon plays it straight down the middle. There are no cheesy one-liners here. There’s a strong supporting cast, with solid turns from David Strathairn as his CIA nemesis Noah Vosen, Joan Allen as a more sympathetic CIA director, Paddy Constantine as a British journalist and Albert Finney as the scientist mastermind behind the Treadstone programme. Of course, comparisons with the James Bond series are inevitable. In fact, the Bourne and Bond franchises have more differences than similarities, although it’s interesting to see how the latest Bond film – Casino Royale – cuts back on the gadgets ‘n’ girls formula and has a more Bourne-like, gritty feel. Perhaps they’re inspiring each other – certainly a couple of scenes (a rooftop chase and bathroom hand-to-hand scrap) crop up in both Casino Royale and Ultimatum.Greengrass keeps the violence focussed. This is no gore-fest. The bodycount is surprisingly low for a movie of this type and there’s little blood to be seen. Which is not to say the fights aren’t brutal: Bourne often gets stuck in and works hand-to-hand, with the camera so close it’s often difficult to see what’s going on. The quick cuts are deliberately disorientating – but not annoyingly so.The film serves up some interesting issues. Who is the real enemy? Where are the safeguards against an unaccountable government? In a ‘war against terror’, do the ends justify the means?Other movies have touched on similar themes. But what seemed fantastical in 1998’s Enemy of the State now seems worryingly more plausible in the post 9/11 era. Particularly, one scene in Ultimatum has eerie parallels with the July 2005 police shooting of a Brazilian electrician at a London underground station, in what turned out to be a calamitous case of mistaken identity.Of course, with any action thriller you have to suspend your disbelief. Fortunately for the screenwriters – and the audience – the frenetic direction doesn’t leave much time to pick holes in the plot, although one does wonder at Bourne’s miraculous ability to find unbarred windows to leap through in even the most maximum-security installations. Clearly, neither Bourne nor his CIA pursuers seem to believe in the adage ‘look before you leap’.And despite producing dispassionate and unemotional operatives via the Treadstone project, the CIA clearly hasn’t kept that philosophy for senior management. Straitham’s Vosen, in particular, takes every opportunity to make snap decisions in times of crisis rather than first considering his options. Sin in haste, repent at leisure. He doesn’t learn.By his nature, Bourne is a loner. There’s no romance in the movie, though fellow CIA employee Nicky Parsons (played by Julia Stiles) pops up to give Bourne someone else to look after. Refreshingly, the character of Pamela Landy (played by Joan Allen) gives one female a strong role at least.The soundtrack is functional and unobtrusive, helping pitch the mood without being overly noticeable. And that’s the way it should be – there’s enough going on already without additional distractions.For a Hollywood blockbuster, Ultimatum is sharp, fast-paced and tight. If you do go and see it, pay attention and enjoy the ride.

463,1163,1163,1163,1163,The Call,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/call-review/,,,,3.6,"Brad ‘The Machinist’ Anderson’s latest film, The Call, is a fast-paced thriller that thrills only in bits, and ends quite weakly. The setting and characters of the film are interesting, but in trying too hard, Anderson ultimately fails in dishing out a gripping thriller. The Call is not unwatchable, but is also not even close to being a must-watch. ","How many times have we watched an American film, where a character dials 911 and cops come bursting through the door soon after? While scores of films have shown cops to be the heroes, often laying their lives for the sake of justice, very rarely has anyone ever a peeked into the lives of the people who actually answer that 911 call. On the surface, it seems like any other call centre – continuous calls, mostly silly, with a caller who is almost always unreasonably agitated. But then, on a lot of calls, also hinge matters of life and death. Anyone who can read, can fix your problem with your cellular operator or your toaster. But a 911 call can be a different story altogether.It is perhaps this aspect of Brad Anderson’s The Call that is most fascinating, because you get to realize the worth of anonymous heroes, who fade into oblivion after answering the call that probably saved lives. Starting off by humanizing these anonymous voices, then moving on to what is actually quite a taut thriller before ultimately descending into near-absurdity when it tries to move in for the kill, The Call is an uneven film that engages you often, but ends up leaving you quite disappointed as you walk out.Halle Berry plays Jordan, a seasoned 911 operator who is damn good at her job. One of her calls, however, doesn’t go quite as expected. Brad Anderson knows how to craft a thriller, that much you have to concede. And what he seems to enjoy a lot is lacing his thriller with just that slight tinge of a horror element. His 2004 film is almost seminal in this regard, frequently flitting the boundaries between thriller and horror with utmost ease. He tries something similar with The Call, though toning down the horror element quite a bit, making it very subtle and visceral. Full marks to him for trying, but the end result isn’t nearly as thrilling or horrifying as he had hoped. The big problem with the film lies in the last half hour of the film. The most important aspect of writing and directing a thriller is knowing when the thrill has reached a peak, and easing the audience off that peak with assuredness. The disadvantage that an out-and-out thriller has is that the audience invariably catches up, making it hard to leave them on a high, unlike other genres. Also, the very premise of the last half hour is absurd, because it goes against the fundamental concept that the film starts off with - the life of a 911 operator. Halle Berry, in a role that she can sleepwalk through, expectedly does a fair job. The rest of the cast pretty much has to stand by and watch her do her thing. Michael Eklund hams it up a bit as a psychopath, overdoing the crazy quite often. However, and this was quite a surprise, I quite liked how his character was written. The reason for him being the way he is, intrigued me quite a bit. His character has a gamut of emotions and layers to it, and is revealed only bit by bit, making it an unexpected facet in this genre of film. Very rarely does a film attempt this. But this eventually also adds to why the climax of the film doesn’t work; it also goes against the fundamental concept of his character. With its crisp 94-minute runtime and brisk pace, The Call often engages you, but it ultimately disappoints. It is never unwatchable, but it just never gets as compelling as it could have been, with the absurd climax being the final nail in the coffin.

Special effects make this movie a visual treat.","We all know Aslan, the White Witch and the Pevensie kids pretty well after the last two Narnia films. This movie brings only the two younger kids, Edmund and Lucy, and their intolerable cousin Eustace to Narnia to help Prince Caspian find the seven lords of Narnia on his ship, the Dawn Treader.A fluent flow of story and regular doses of excitement keeps you rooted to your seats through the run-time. Unlike the previous episodes, where they rushed to cover the plot points of the story, this movie brings out depth to the characters of the film. The music intensifies the terror and matches the unhurried plot development.
 
A good thing is that you don’t need to read the novels to understand this movie. Of course people who’ve read the series will argue differently because of a couple of changed sequences, but that is true of every classic fantasy novel adapted into a movie. I could see kids in the theatre tremendously enjoy themselves, and adults to seemed to genuinely like the world of magic and wonderment. The dialogues are awesome, but I bet they are right from the book. The actors playing the Pevensie kids haven’t improved much over the previous films. But casting Will Poulter in the role of Eustace Srubb is one of the better decisions. He does a brilliant job of being a whiny, unbelieving and obnoxious cousin. His encounters with Reepcheep, the talking mouse, give many a laugh with excellent timing and dialogues. Ben Barnes plays a good Caspian portraying his buried doubts of ability.The action sequences are really good, especially considering that the target audience is school kids. Though the emotional scenes were a bit lengthy and boring, I am sure kids will love them. The special effects are superb too. The talking mouse Reepcheep, the invisible castle and Monocolis (one legged dwarfs) are awesomely made. Things like showing fog issuing from invisible and magical mirrors' mouths were great ideas to make the film believable yet magical. That Aslan looks old and less majestic, was a major disappointment for me because I love his character the most. Thankfully, his reverberating voice is as captivating as ever before. And they tried their best to make the scariest serpent and the most beautiful dragon. 
Though the climax feels like a mix of Pirates of the Caribbean and Harry Potter, it has its own charm. 3D sure helps, though they could have made it much scarier and more appealing. With a little more maturity in the story than the previous films shows, direction takes the cake for this film. Like any other book adopted into a film, this one has loopholes too. So if you have read the novels, you surely not going to like the way they twist the story to their convenience. But the visual treat compensates for it. In any case, this film is a good watch for kids as well as adults, - 3D or 2D.

That is pretty much all there is to the film. And those of you who do not go queasy at the sight of gore, you must stay away from this film even more, because the only people who are truly subjected to torture in this horror/torture flick is the audience. As mindless as slapstick films named after the progeny of turbaned folk, but far more difficult to sit through, The Collection is as avoidable as it can get.","I like to look to draw positives from every movie; the positive I drew from The Collection is that at least the worst film I’ve watched on the big screen this year isn’t an Indian one. The Collection, by sheer virtue of its genre, caters to a very niche audience. After all, not many people like to spend an hour and a half watching body parts being dismembered, human beings being tortured with sharp steel jaws and spikes, hairy tarantulas walking over a girl’s face and the likes. Such people should any way stay away from films like this and others of its ilk. But films of this genre do have their hardcore, loyal audience. Though I don’t particularly belong to that category, I do enjoy blood-and-gore on screen, when done well. In fact, I actually liked the first installment of Saw, a 'seminal' film in this genre, if I could say such a thing. The further films in the series went from bad to worse, but that is another story. Or Eli Roth’s Hostel for that matter, another film that I quite enjoyed for its B-movie indulgence. From Dusk Till Dawn is another film that comes to mind - though it was about vampires, it was equally gory.Here though, I doubt even hardcore loyalists will draw anything at all from The Collection. A random assortment of torture and murder scenes with no regard for space, time or logic, this is the kind of film that makes 82 minutes seem like eternity and then some. And it isn’t just the wanton castration of human bodies that is the problem. The excruciating non-imaginativeness of every scene and situation without even the semblance of an effort to inject the slightest credibility into the treatment makes you almost wish that someone drove a rusty steel spike through you instead. At least your own torture would end then.All films, good or bad, have a ‘story’. This one does too; a particularly silly one. Through a montage of newscasts, we are introduced to the fact that a violent serial killer is on the prowl – one who kills in numbers at random locations and then abducts people from the scene, their whereabouts completely unknown after that. Inevitably, he abducts a girl, which then sets off a chain of events that lead to a group of men and women trapped in an abandoned hotel that is actually a maze-like deathly lair belonging to our masked serial killer. His barbaric instruments of torture and death are all over; tripping over a tiny thread can cause god-knows-what horrific contraption to skewer you.It doesn’t help that firstly the writers and director, and then the cast, take themselves way too seriously. Had they chosen to go Robert Rodriguez on this film, it could actually have made for a hangout movie; where friends can laugh and snigger while the people involved with the film laugh at themselves as well. No such luck here. Everyone clearly believed that a masterpiece was in the making. The cast is full of familiar faces, but not familiar names; they are all bit actors who’ve made fleeting appearances in big movies. On1 some level I actually felt bad for them. They clearly were under the impression that this is their big break to stardom, which it is most certainly not. The Collection is supposedly a sequel to a cult horror film, The Collector, which was also directed by Marcus Dunstan, director and co-writer of this film. I haven’t watched that, and if it is anything like this, I’m glad I haven’t, because The Collection scrapes the bottom of the cinematic barrel.

The film makes will have you hooked and rooting for the characters; if you’re the kind that scares easy, I assure you you’ll have some good fun.","I was slightly disappointed that the DVD of The Conjuring (a single DVD pack, as usual), had only one special feature - a roughly 8-minute segment titled 'Scaring the @$*% Out of You'. Pretty much a 'making of', the video does give a glimpse into director James Wan's style of work, but it leaves you wanting more. Considering how much effort went into the look, feel and the design of the scares, a more comprehensive featurette would have been wonderful. Also, the DVD doesn't have audio or subtitle options in any Indian languages, which is a pity.It is left to the movie, then, to make the DVD of the film a collectible. The Conjuring, for me, is one of best horror films in recent times, and that becomes even more apparent while watching it for the second time on DVD. Despite knowing exactly how the film is going to pan out, it still manages to involve you in the period, the location and the characters. James Wan is an exciting director to watch out for in the horror space, because he knows how to use familiar tropes well, and he really paces the horror elements well. The Conjuring is must-own for fans of horror!A film that announces, right at the start, that it is based on a true story, always tends to make you shift in your seat with some anticipation. And when that film delves into the supernatural, you are bound to be even more intrigued. One of the big tragedies of the life that I have spent almost wholly sucked into the world of cinema is the fact that the one genre which hasn’t been able to penetrate deep into the corners of my soul is horror. I’ve never been terrified while watching a horror film, which also means that I’m usually the wrong person to be doling out opinions on whether a film is scary or not. Horror, for me, is an extension of the thriller genre, and that’s usually how I judge every horror film. The Conjuring, then, draws you into a dark world, hooks you and lets you go feeling quite, well, thrilled.Based on a hitherto untold true story from the case files of famous paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren – who were also involved in investigating The Amityville Haunting, amongst other ‘famous’ real life supernatural stories – The Conjuring sets itself up with a familiar premise – a family of seven (a couple with five daughters) moves into a new house and begins to experience strange occurrences almost as soon as they do. The Warrens are brought in to look into the matter, even as the haunting begins to assume proportions they hadn’t experienced so far in their professional lives investigating paranormal phenomena.In the hands of genre expert James Wan – Saw and Insidious are the two films of his I’ve watched earlier, and both are good fun – The Conjuring doffs its hat to The Exorcist, but uses silences and pauses as its greatest weapons in attempting to scare the audience. It uses minimal music but familiar startling visual tropes that keep building up in frequency and intensity through the film. What I really liked about The Conjuring is the fact that it has a nice graph – a slow build up, a gripping middle and a conclusive, definite resolution. Also, the film is set in the early 70s, and it manages to create a nice feel for the time period with its grainy look, colour tone and production design. What also sets The Conjuring slightly apart from most other recent horror films is that it makes you invest emotionally in not just the family that is being haunted, but also with those who are called in to help the family in their distress – you root for both parties equally – because there is always the unshakable feeling that both parties have something at stake.However, it is Vera Farmiga, who plays Lorraine Warren, that’s easily the best thing about the film. Blessed with the most charming, pleasing and warm screen presence, she is almost like the shining beacon of hope in The Conjuring. To borrow a term from the Harry Potter series, she’s almost like a Patronus – a guardian against negativity and evil. Patrick Wilson, a frequent star in James Wan’s films, creates a credible aura of support as Ed Warren. Mostly though, The Conjuring is the kind of film that works because of the ambiance it creates in the cinema hall. Barring those who attempt to mask their fear by indulging in loud commentary and lame humour, the film unites the audience in its gasping reactions to what is being witnessed. For that experience alone, The Conjuring is best watched in the theatre, in the last possible night show that you can find. Go for it then; I envy you for the fun you’ll have, while I deal with my own ironical curse of non-scary horror.

467,1167,1167,1167,1167,The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/the-curious-case-of-benjamin-button-review/,,,,3.266666667,"A satisfying drama with an unusual premise that allows the viewer to reflect on life, love, and loss.","David Fincher is known for his films that tend to be ruminative, bleak inquiries into the human condition, as seen through the eyes of the chief protagonist. His earlier Seven and Fight Club both starred Brad Pitt and were extremely grim. Here he teams up with writer Eric Roth (of Forrest Gump fame) and Brad Pitt for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and gives us a film which is in parts hopeful and uplifting, with respect to its take on life and living. One essential feature of being human is our capacity to reflect on our lives; we try hard to make some sense out of all the chaos that we experience. We are bound by Time; we are born young and are inexorably doomed to age, and die. That is something we cannot defeat. One tends to visualize life as a journey; a journey where we acquire companions and lose them, knowing fully well that there would come a time when we would be lost to others too. 
But what if it all happened in reverse? Just supposing that one is born old; then the journey would start with old age and end with baby hood. This would provide us with a completely different perspective; we would be born looking at the world with eyes that are old and rheumy and die in the cradle. This is the angle that the film adopts, and the director and writer use this outlook to fashion a story about the chief character’s (Benjamin Button) life. The similarities with Forrest Gump are immediately obvious; Benjamin is born with a debilitating physical condition, there is a woman who remains the love of his life, he moves through well defined time periods in American History, and tries to make sense of it all and in the process gives some pithy sayings about life. The key difference is that in Forrest Gump, History was one of the main characters, Gump existed as a prop for History; here History is given short shrift
(though we are constantly aware of it as an addendum to the frame). The movie is not that cheesy either (remember that line about life and a box of chocolates in Forrest Gump?), it instead comes across as a rather detailed portrait of Benjamin Button. The movie has three stages: Benjamin’s childhood, his coming of age as he leaves home to learn a trade, and his eventual return and death. Brad Pitt is Benjamin Button and his portrayal is satisfactory Special effects technologies are employed to transform Brad Pitt's physical appearance at various stages in the film. The special effects are very well done, including the makeup for the face and skin, that blend completely into the frame. But Pitt's acting somehow falls short; as a child Pitt does nothing that would demonstrate the limitations that his body has with respect to his mental age.  We see no glimpses of mischief, nor of childlike curiosity barring a couple of fleeting scenes. But that is it, and somehow this tremendous opportunity to reflect on how a young child (mentally) trapped in an old and aged body would respond is completely lost. Benjamin Button’s character also comes across as too goody goody, there is nary a bad bone in his body and he is constantly polite and clear of heart. That is something difficult to digest, and especially with his physical condition. We see no signs of frustration, irritation, or anger; he is as sweet as an angel throughout. Contrast this with Daniel Day Lewis’s performance in My Left foot for example. The supporting cast is tremendous. Taraji Henson as Queenie is very good and so is Tilda Swinton as Elizabeth Abott. 
The portrayal of the tugboat captain, Captain Mike, who considers himself an artist, by Jared Harris is brilliant. 
Cate Blanchett is adequate throughout; she looks particularly radiant when she plays the younger Daisy. David Fincher maintains a steady tempo and sticks to old fashioned story telling; no sudden shifts in time, no fast cuts, and no handheld cameras either. The tale unfolds at a leisurely pace, and is packed with incidents, and hence the pace does not flag. The period feel is beautifully recreated; the opening footage of the clock maker who makes a clock which runs in reverse, the scenes of Benjamin’s childhood in the old age home, the meetings with Elizabeth Abbott in the lobby of the Russian hotel, all look and feel natural. The movie seems to suggest a subversive message – that old age is not all that bad and that growing younger is something to be feared and avoided. This is in complete contrast to the youth obsessed consumer culture that is prevalent today. The movie also possibly points out that both old age and childhood are nearly the same – something that the Bard of Avon also pointed quite some centuries ago. This is a film which flows gently; there are no sudden surprises, no fortuitous acts of God either. Overall the film is rock solid without being outstanding, and is definitely for those who would want to think about their lives in the dark comfort of a theatre.

468,1168,1168,1168,1168,The Dark Knight Rises,Owner's Pride!,wogma review8 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/dark-knight-rises-review/,,5/5.0,,3.6,"The Dark Knight Rises is closure at its best: wise use of classic components like a brute villain, a slowly growing film that takes its time to revel in it’s linear structure, establishing every detail for you to absorb and an explosive yet comforting end. Do yourself a favour and don’t compare the film to its predecessors. Watch The Dark Knight Rises the way it should be watched: not in 3D, and with an open, patient mind. You will be blown away.  ","Christopher Nolan really knows how to play with our minds. He sparked a whole new world of ideas in our heads with The Dark Knight in 2008, and of course, had a field day with Inception, but if you pay enough attention, you’ll realize that he isn’t trying to impress us with The Dark Knight Rises. Nor is he merely telling a story (or closing one, in this case). As a sensible filmmaker and storyteller, he’s left the best (read: eccentric, layered and mind-boggling) parts behind, with the peak of the trilogy, which was The Dark Knight.The Dark Knight Rises is what a finale should be; all-encompassing yet mysterious enough to hold one’s intrigue, mature, and not experimental in it’s treatment of characters and individual scenes and it builds up to a spectacularly fulfilling, almost calming climax and end. The film begins with a near-dystopian Gotham, a shattered Bruce Wayne and no sign of Batman, 8 years since the tragic night he took the blame for Harvey Dent’s wayward crimes. By now, Gotham has taken an economical and global hit (very well merged with real-life crises) and Bruce Wayne shows no sign of returning as the city’s “masked vigilante”.The slowly panned out first half establishes all it’s characters and the scenario with meticulous detail. This could have been an impatient viewer's grudge with the film, but Nolan gives you enough to bite on before an impending explosion of a second half. We are introduced to Bane (Tom Hardy), a muscular masked terrorist leader who intends on destroying Gotham City. While Hardy’s personality as Bane doesn’t match up to the sinister villains of the previous films (and it’s safe to say here that Ledger’s Joker is very hard to match up to), his sheer gritty look is enough to instill fear. Here his mask does the trick; often you can’t understand what he’s saying but you’re half expecting him to, at any moment, lose his temper and tear everything to pieces. His brute demeanor convinces you that he can break Batman apart, and that coupled with a looming fear is what classic villains are made of. Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) a jewel thief who robs for survival, and has several heated interactions with Batman. Tradionally, she’s known as Bane’s aid, but in the film she follows her own trajectory. Hathaway is strong, witty and plays her part of the Catwoman (although she is never called that) with much panache. Marion Cotillard plays the millionaire Miranda Tate who is a part of the Wayne Enterprises board, and a means of support for Batman as she encourages him to stand up to his responsibility. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake, the young police officer is a symbol of our voices as an audience. Through the film we keep expecting Batman to rise, and we never lose faith in him, and Gordon-Levitt’s character recreates the faith that the film continuously needs to fall back on. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman resume their characters as Alfred, Fox and Gordon respectively. All of this is familiar territory; a predictable build up to Bane’s terrorist plans and as an audience that has seen the first two films, we know what’s in store for us. However, as Batman rises and the film starts rolling into action, every moment that you witness is filled with the baggage of 7 years and 2 films, and Nolan presents every moment victoriously. He gives you what you want to see, triumphs what needs to be triumphed, and slashes what needs to burn. And therefore, unlike The Dark Knight (and my intention here is not to compare the films but our reception of them), this film doesn’t knock the ground off your feat, but manages to restore it back in place for your sense of stability. 
The Dark Knight Rises is mature story telling; it closes ends but also leaves a tiny mischievous slit open. It has a barrage of inspiring dialogue and superhero morals soaked in action-heavy sequences that are visually epic (kudos to cinematographer Wally Pfister and Hans Zimmer for the audio-visual treat). 
Essentially, the film gives you everything that you would need in a finale. You might have wanted more unexpected craziness and more edge of the seat moments (the expectations this film was riding on was almost unreal). However, The Dark Knight Rises is more about what you need as a viewer (and a follower of the trilogy), which is a fluctuating closure: one that’s classic and mature, and yet satisfies your need to be surprised. And for recognizing and executing that, take a bow Nolan.

469,1169,1169,1169,1169,The Darkest Hour,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/darkest-hour-review/,,,,3.6,"Fear and darkness is certain in a movie where the world is coming to an end. If the reason behind the end is aliens, you need a constant sense of fear, and newer, scarier antics to keep you moving. The Darkest Hour might not give you that consistency in terms of a moving, slowly unfolding film but the background score (more so in beginning of the film) and the visuals will spook you enough. ","For 89 mins, The Darkest Hour is a crisp, fairly-spine chilling film that gives you the necessary thrills, considering the only good part of the film are the visuals. But then again, a film about alien invasion banks heavily upon the visuals. It seems director Chris Gorak (also art director of Fight Club and director of Wanted) takes that pre-requisite a bit too seriously. The Darkest Hour has flat characters, almost no plot development, but you forgive and forget it as you submerge in the chilly background music and the scary pace. The film starts in Moscow, as two Americans Sean and Ben arrive to sell some high-flying technological software. They meet two American girls eventually (Natalie and Anne – the fact that they don’t have second names, let alone a back story should give you enough proof about the lack of depth in the film) and party the night away. It’s then that invisible aliens - what look like a lethal, dusty mirage - eat into the entire city, killing every single living being. We are shown the alien’s point-of-view as well – where humans look like walking tissues, and on coming in contact with them, humans get reduced to dust. The film then tracks how the survivors from their first attack (all four Americans and the handful Russians they meet on the way) battle their way through this apocalyptic mess they find themselves in.If you need a couple of reasons to watch the film, you’ll be happy to know the effects and scare-factor is at its maximum. It’s a phenomenon I find most of these apocalyptic films have in common regardless of their basic plot. You are going to find the idea of the world (as you know it) coming to an end, extremely creepy. It’s a must-have in any film with such content (like The Day After Tomorrow and 2012).The Darkest Hour banks on this factor. The first half hour is truly terrifying, and you learn to ignore the unexciting acting of the lead foursome (Emile Hirsch, Olivia Thirlby, Rachael Taylor and Max Minghella) but soon enough you realize the color palate, the plot development and the threat (aka the aliens) are all pretty flat. It’s simple; if the aliens are going to be invisible, the plot has the keep the viewer hooked on by topping the horror-factor every now and then. What you see The Darkest Hour is the same incident being repeated again and again. People dying the same way (barring one bus sequence which keeps you on the edge of seat), and only sporadically, you get spooked by some unexpectedness. The real winner of The Darkest Hour is the cinematographer, Scott Kevan, who puts in front of us an extremely gripping visual of a dark city under threat by supernatural forces. It’s this sight that will bring you chills more than dusty, invisible aliens, repetitive background scores and one-dimensional, predictable performances.

470,1170,1170,1170,1170,The Descendants,Owner's Pride!,wogma review5 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/descendants-review/,,5/5.0,,3.6,"George Clooney in the first 5 minutes of The Descendants says via a voiceover, “I am the backup parent, the understudy”, and immediately you know this is going to be a coming of age film, which is ironical considering the film spans over 10 days. To be able to turn things around convincingly, in a story that encompasses that time frame, is no easy job. The film manages to inculcate in you, the same values that the Rajshri’s have been trying for generations (coupled with a darling of a story). This time around, with The Descendants, Alexandre Payne makes the job seem effortless and manages to tug your heart. ","Forgive my comparison, but this year The Descendants has almost taken on the same avatar as last year’s little gem, The King’s Speech i.e. a feel good film that brightens your day and also, wins all the movie awards. While the films are widely apart in their premise, the one thing you can be certain of is that it will be one of the most emotionally captivating films you would have seen till date. The beauty of The Descendants lies in its exterior – the visual picture gives you no clue about the journey you’re about to take with the film. With the backdrop of the serene and beach-y Hawaiian islands, the film tracks Matt King (Clooney) and his family’s journey as the family tries to cope with a great loss. They are also left with a large plot of land from their ancestors: a non-touristy, beautiful piece of the island that King, as the sole trustee of the land, has to decide the outcome of. They lose the lease in 7 years. King and his two daughters set the ball rolling as a perfectly dysfunctional family. Along with the land decisions, a tragedy occurs in the family when his wife hits her head rather hard in a boating accident. This leaves King alone with his children while the wife is in coma. And that is not the only tragedy.Clooney as Matt King is emotionally defensive; however the elder daughter Alex (the radiant Shailene Woodley) has troubles with alcohol and a general adolescent angst. The other daughter Scottie (Amara Miller, also the cutest of the lot) deals with her own personal rebellion of the absence of a mother figure. Both young actors are sassy and have a cracking chemistry that serve as a funny sidetrack from the serious business. They are all running in different directions and you almost want to sit them down and comfort them separately. Such is the first quarter of the film, which fills you with concern and frustration as an empathetic viewer. It’s not a complimentary bond, and therefore you wonder about placing a film that deals with the sense of loss and rejection in a locale that oozes tranquility. However, the Hawaiian island serves as a perfect catalyst for such a setting. Director of photography, Phedon Papamichael brings out this conflict beautifully. For every emotionally heavy scene, the following cut-away has a sense of hope and calm. The background music is almost surreal; country music coupled with part soothing, part peppy Hawaiian vocals that you would imagine playing in a beach shack. This entire package plays out as an oxymoron, bringing out with even more conviction the brewing storm in every character’s head. Clooney is a charm, as the virtual torchbearer of the film, playing single dad in mostly a pair of plain polo t-shirts and colorful Bermuda shorts. He himself asks you not to take the get up seriously; most influential people in the city dress down and casual. We see CEOs in the same avatar; even in a scene when Clooney breaks serious news to his extended family, they’re wearing floral dresses and shirts. This becomes a beautiful routine in the film – between the windy palm trees, floral wear and Hawaiian music you experience a deep familial connect with the story. A shout out to the other characters in the film that grow on you immensely – Robert Forster as Elizabeth’s (the wife) father is temperamental and scenes between him and the rest of the family are all nerve and smiles. Another special mention is of older daughter Alex’s boyfriend (Nick Krause) who is hilariously annoying, and manages to win your heart with his goofy-ness. Clooney’s subtle character growth goes in tandem with the sometimes humorous, sometimes deep narrative. It’s a character-driven story that manages to beautifully weave into an intelligent and expressive film. Each subsidiary character brings something extra to the table, as you connect with their personal voice in the film (you cry along with Scottie when she is told about her mother, you want to tell Alex to be a bit more sensitive to her dad who is dealing with his own baggage and suchlike). Don’t miss The Descendants, as you accompany the film on its path to self-discovery with a warm story.

For its wit even if might seem a little over-written. For its nerve even if the after-taste is that of an under-cooked story. For Vidya Balan because she is entertainment! ,"sattaakkk A slap on the audience's face - The Dirty Picture. The lewd men that watch a film just so they can experience Silk's (Vidya Balan) performance are the one's sitting in the audience right now - you and me. Of course, not me as in literally me, because I'm neither a man nor a lesbian. And sure, not all men enjoy a bold woman. But there are enough of us in the audience for whom Silk Smitha starred in 400+ films! And that's just one sex symbol from the 80s. There were others like Nylon Nandini and Polyster Padmini whose lives collectively forms The Dirty Picture's Silk. Even their names make us smirk, and a second later, we snicker at what their personalities stand for. Yet a sizable number from amongst us watch their films. The Dirty Picture is about a woman who not only flaunts what she has, but knows its value and encashes it unapologetically. She has accepted herself. How many women do you know who are absolutely comfortable with who they are? And I haven't even asked about them being comfortable with their sexuality.  In fact, so relaxed is Silk with herself that she makes us uncomfortable. The Dirty Picture is an uncomfortable watch. How can someone be so positive about doing something that is so dark-gray in society, that it's almost black? And she is making the same society, us, dance. Add to this discomfort, the torture of having to watch flab and the female lead's stomach tiers, in the 21st century. Hell, we are even uncomfortable with our bodies. But, Silk is uninhibited and so is the director, Milan Luthria. It's a huge risk to make your female lead look ugly and fat. And to say, ""You want gratuitous skin-show? Here, take it. And here's some more."" You are literally force-fed cleavage to the point that the guy (yes, guy!) sitting behind me said ""It's getting boring now"" when there is a half-naked woman on the screen. Yeah, the second half slips. The first half is breezy and completely entertaining. The second half gets too caught up in showing the pathos that comes with stardom. It does leave you with a ""She came. She got you excited. She left."" But the lull in the second half might be intentional. Because the said pathos however mundane and predictable, needed to be shown. Maybe the line just before the interval is a warning. It's a clever line. And so is almost every line in the film. The dialogue in ""The Dirty Picture"" feels like a twitter timeline composed of extremely witty people. Over-written, maybe, but I thoroughly enjoyed the humor, I laughed out loud, and there were instances when the theater laughed after a pause that it took for the line to register. The wit alone is entertainment enough. I'm not a huge fan of self-referential jokes in our films because they get repetitive. But, The Dirty Picture has one in which it felt like the director has left an extra second or two, like a stand-up comedian, for the audience to ""get"" it. And it works. It's a huge compliment to both Milan Luthria's confidence and the actor's performance, because it meant that he made us forget who he is. Similarly, all your awe for the actor that Naseeruddin Shah is vanishes and you want to slap him for his arrogance and sleaze. Tusshar Kapoor plays a forgettable character, and I mean that as a compliment. Because, his character is meant to be unimportant and he plays it well. Vidya Balan...almost the whole review is a rave about her. She made me feel for a character who I otherwise would have dismissed as characterless.You could see why men would fall for Silk, and not just for her physical boldness. Like films that glamorize underworld dons, she has glamorized our ""sex icons"" from yesteryears and you don't feel squirmy. Instead, you empathize and even convince yourself that they have been victims. Even though every decision they make towards that dark-gray zone of society is a conscious one. Sure, the writing must have its merits for the actors to achieve what they did. But, throughout the film, you feel that you are getting snippets of someone's life, like newspaper cuttings. The flow is missing and you just see glimpses of the layers that make Silk an intriguing person. It also felt like this was done knowingly, to add to the enigma that she is. But, it left me wanting to peel off the mask and see the person behind. A feeling of being told an incomplete story. On the other hand, I'm glad they didn't serve me a sappy backstory. Usually, something lacking in the story would make me recommend a film a little less. But there are other bits in the writing that make up for it in The Dirty Picture. Especially, the climax, not in the way it's played out, but the reason behind why things end the way they do. It's subtle and it flows by swiftly. But it's beautiful and is one of the few things that work in the second half. Again, those shortcomings still do not take away from the bravado it takes to show a plump woman for 150 minutes; the pluck it takes to make cleavage undesirable (okay, maybe I'm taking it too far, but it makes cleavage look like breasts - a regular part of anatomy); the nerve it takes to tell the story of a woman who people look down upon. Surely, the Silk Smithas of the world are smiling in their graves.

Based on the novel, The Eagle of The Ninth, this film is set in the year 140 AD, and tells the story of Marcus Aquila (Channing Tatum), a young Roman soldier who embarks on a quest to find his lost legion’s golden emblem, ‘the eagle’ which went missing some years ago. The emblem was defended by his father’s army - 5,000 soldiers - who are believed to have died in that conquest, after they tried to conquer British territory, outside the Roman empire. Several attempts were made to retrieve the men and the emblem they so proudly defended, but in vain. In fact, before Aquila, whoever embarked on a similar journey never returned alive.The film is a pure adventure and one that’s fraught with challenges of trust, endurance, hunger and survival from the enemy of tribals. Aquila, is joined by a Brit, Esca (Jamie Bell) who despite being a prisoner of war, is sworn to loyalty as a slave.I loved this contrast between the two characters - the Roman Aquila takes the help of his enemy, a Brit (Esca) to find an emblem that matters only to the Romans. Esca’s characterisation is wonderful and it shows remarkable colours during their journey together, often surprising us and convincing us that humanity always triumphs over evil.I’d have liked it if Aquila’s character had been fleshed out a little better - what makes him so passionate about retrieving the legion? What was his life like after his father disappeared in that infamous incident and how did he train to be so strong? Some history to how Esca became a slave amongst the Romans would also have added some meat to the screenplay, especially during their journey together.Stories which are about the search for something precious, something that was lost and retrieved, must build enough cause into the conquest. For example, why is the Eagle emblem so important? Why does the honour of the empire matter so much? The result is a very flat, wooden story of two men searching for something and an army determined not to let them have it. It’s entertaining alright, and their journey is very watchable. What wrecks me is that this could have turned out from being merely a good film, to a really good film, with just a little more effort.The action scenes, the slow-mo are well-choreographed. Tatum looks a lot like Owen Wilson (without the broken nose) and I felt he’s a bit wooden throughout the film. If there’s one thing I’d change about this film, it would be Tatum - he seems like the wrong choice for the lead role.Costume dramas have this ability to transport you into a different world. This film tries to, but right from the first shot, there seems something odd. I wondered whether the actors were doing a dress rehearsal, because the actors’ dialogues do not have an ancient stamp about them. Also, after being on the road for so many days, how come Aquila and Esca don’t grow a beard? It’s what I call, ‘typos’ in a film.Despite these drawbacks, The Eagle is still worth a visit. It may not register as a movie you’d remember for a long time, but it is engaging in a good way, while it lasts.

Still, the film is watchable because Washington is always a class act.","Antoine Fuqua, whose last film Olympus Has Fallen was as silly as it could get, has made a dramatic u-turn with The Equalizer. A calculated, dark film with Denzel Washington playing the kind of character he's almost come to be synonymous with, the film often gives you a sense of deja vu - but not always in a good way. The Equalizer is a rather strange film, to be honest. A dark thriller can either be racy, or it can be measured. Fuqua chooses the latter path, and takes it to the extreme. No surprises, no heart-in-your-mouth moments, no twists to grab at you - nothing. Denzel Washington plays Robert McCall - a regular man with a seemingly regular life, which he makes an attempt at living like clockwork. But he has a past, McCall - and it comes to the fore when the situation calls for it.Everything in the film is understated - the humour, the gloss, the grunge - all of it. Washington's McCall is a cool customer at all times; yet he knows how to wield not just regular weapons, but ordinary household object as weapons as well. The reason for it, McCall's back story is only hinted at. We never get to know why he went from some sort of special-ops or military to living a staid, lonely life. Presumably, he's done stuff he's either ashamed of or regretful for.And then, we never quite know why McCall turns it around again, as the events of the film unfold. Perhaps it's him feeling sorry for a character who, from his perspective, is having it rough. Or it is just a case of a leopard not being able to change its spots. Either way, McCall takes it on himself to fight injustice and evil when he sees it, in a manner that he deems fit.Denzel Washington, and indeed Robert McCall, are ice cool in more ways than one. A Sherlock-esque ability to read situations; a pleasant, fatherly demeanour; deadly fighting skills - he's a perfect movie character, in a manner that confuses even other characters in the film. It is in this aspect, of straddling a realistic and edgy treatment style with out-and-out 'movie' characters, where The Equalizer stumbles often.Everything seems to be carefully planned out. When one deliberately chooses a realistic tone to treat the film, the tone lends itself to a feeling of unpredictability, of not knowing what might happen next. But with The Equalizer, that never happens, because with characters like these, you know exactly what's going to happen. It doesn't help that Fuqua further inserts 'cool' cinema techniques like the slow motion and rapid cuts once in a while.The film thus ends up becoming most fascinating only on paper, particularly with its title. It's an unequal world; a world of haves and haves-not; a world where someone is always one-up on someone else. In such a world, you need someone to bring that balance, to even things out a bit. To equalize.Trapped in his own image, Denzel Washington still manages to rise above that and seem like the guy you'd want on your side when the odds are stacked against you. But in walking the tightrope between the real and the reel, you end up confused about whether the directionless journey of this character really amounts to much.With all of this and the slow pace of the film, you often begin to think of the point of it all. The shot-taking begins to seem redundant, all of it seems like a soulless exercise, and it leaves you feeling distant and uninvolved. Bad guys who're good and good guys who're bad - both kinds make for fascinating movie characters if they manage to touch your heart. The Equalizer makes sense for the most, but it just doesn't touch the heart.

You have to be a serious action star fan with a lot of time and really strong eardrums to enjoy this one.","You'd think that somebody would suggest to the guys writing the cheques that sequels to uninspiring, sagging franchises won't quite cut it in the risky business that filmmaking is. Clearly though, nobody has done that yet.A whole battalion of former stars, with some former stars as additions, are back to provide loud bangs, done-to-death action sequences and the occasional smile-worthy lines in a film that the world could have done just as easily without. The Expendables 3 is a film which does have at least a couple of moments that make you not dismiss it as a complete waste of time, but only just.Expectedly, this one too begins with one rather far-fetched action scene, then proceeds to a few more, then finally ends with a long drawn action sequence. The question of what the plot of the film is, then, is moot.It's cute, honestly, how the film attempts to tackle themes like loyalty and love amongst brothers-in-arms; the awkward relationship that men share, when they can't be openly expressive about their genuine love and respect for each other, but how they will put their life on the line when the time calls for it. Too bad that the cynical times we live in means that for a substantial majority of the audience, these ideas belong in cold storage - quite like the men that make up the cast.Even though the all-action-star lineup is well past its sell-by date, they do still have that slight lingering air of glittering machismo that once made the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Wesley Snipes, Jason Statham and Harrison Ford into global superstars. Most of them look awkward on screen now, save for Jason Statham, who is also the only one of the lot who could actually ever act. The most welcome addition to the cast is Mel Gibson, who plays the baddie with unabashed glee; and he also gets the best line in the film.Stallone, who has also been credited with the story and co-credited with screenplay, gets the meatiest role, though I use that term relatively. It is hard to see why anyone must actually be credited with the story here, because it is so merely functional that a couple of jagged cuts with whole lines of dialogue cut out - presumably the censor board's orders - seem to make no difference at all.If there is one reason why it is a tad bit easier to be kinder to an Expendables film, than to, say, Kick or Jai Ho, it is the technical wizardry at their disposal. All of the most far-fetched action scenes merge live-action and CG beautifully, making it easier to suspend one's disbelief. Real-looking ludicrousness is, after all, quite easier to buy than tacky-looking ludicrousness.Hopefully, at least the plight of this film will make the makers see sense and not subject us to a part four. Even if it does, I doubt a review of that film will read any differently than this one.

A poorly shot and directed film, it is marginally watchable only because of the prospect of Benedict Cumberbatch playing the enigmatic Assange, but even his performance seems laboured. Hopefully, there will be more films to come on who is easily one of the most controversial contemporary figures.","Is there anyone at all in the world who has dared to use the unparalleled power of the World Wide Web towards a more controversial and daring endeavour than WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange? A man who single-handedly shook up the diplomatic establishment with his avante-garde whistleblowers' website, even a cursory read on Assange will tell you that his life is a story worth knowing about.You'd think that it would be pretty hard to mess up a film on the life of a man like Assange; you'd have so much material to go by that you wouldn't need to put in any extra effort to dramatize goings-on, or attempt any technical gimmickry to make things appear interesting. Well, it turns out that the director of the last two Twilight films can, indeed, make such a mess.One of the key problems with Bill Condon's The Fifth Estate is its jarring visual treatment; the gritty, shaky camera and nervous, frequent-cutting were probably employed to keep the audience on the edge at all times, but it just doesn't work. This is the kind of film where you want the writing to do the talking, not the camera or technique. Alas, the narrative of the film is flat, because of a singularly uninspiring screenplay.  The film merely documents some of the key leaks that took the world by storm, while intermittently pausing to show Assange as a well-intentioned but egotistical, stubborn maniac - a man who didn't want to relinquish control simply because he trusted no one. There isn't anything in the film that you don't know or couldn't guess. It is watchable, but rarely anything more.Of course, a large part of the blame lies on the source material of the film. Based on the book 'Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange and the World's Most Dangerous Website' 
by Assange's erstwhile associate Daniel Domscheit-Berg, the film rarely offers any insight into Assange, or rarely delves into any truly thrilling or spectacular secrets that would shock the world. Berg and Assange had a well-known falling out, and while the film doesn't particularly go out of its way to paint Assange in a negative light, it almost seems more like an attempt to exonerate Berg from any blame.All eyes were on Benedict Cumberbatch and his portrayal of the controversial figure. Well, Cumberbatch has clearly tried hard. The problem is that the effort shows. His mannerisms and diction seem effected, though one can't fault him for failing to convey the right emotion. Daniel Brühl, last seen as Niki Lauda in Rush, is excellent as always. He plays the author of the book the film is based on. He at least manages to convince you of his side of the story clearly. Even though Assange's character comes across as merely a slightly unusual piece of cardboard. I doubt that The Fifth Estate will be the last film on the life and times of Julian Assange, because surely there's a whole lot more to the man than what has hitherto been whistled and blown about. While this film is ordinary at best, something far more interesting - in true Assange style - is the open letter that Assange wrote to Benedict Cumberbatch when the film was still in its early days. That letter, at the very least, has a shred of emotion in it.

With performers like Vinay Pathak, Ranvir Shorey, Abhimanyu Singh, Ravi Kissen, it's short, but not-so-sweet fun.","It's so exciting when you are watching a film and you start thinking of the specific people who you want to recommend it to. And it's such an anti-climax when you get out of the theater and the enthusiasm to spread the word has somewhat dithered. I don't really know if I can blame the makers for the climax because there aren't too many other ways the film could have gone. But, while Emotional Atyachar lasts, you are promised sharp dialogue from the world of sleaze. Thus you have been warned to the crass language and innuendoes. But the humor is quirky and comes and goes really quick, so you have to be attentive and of course get past the profanity. There are random little things which you might not remember later, but if reminded they are sure to bring a smile. Emotional Atyachar has an absolutely fantastic start. The spooky feel and range of characters builds and maintains intrigue. Right from the wannabe, Gujrati businessman to the muse played by Kalki Koechlin, each character is eccentric in one way or the other and it works. Yep! Even the stereotype works, because of the everyday yet witty dialogue. However, the film suffers the way any 90-minute film with so many characters would. Looks like an inexperienced person had some say in what parts of the story stays out of the film. In a film which otherwise had a decent flow, Emotional Atyachar has a few effects without any apparent causes. For example, why the businessman is refused funding or how does a character free himself after being tied down. The amateur editing also shows in the fact that the 90 minutes run-time is split into 60 minutes pre-interval and 30 minutes post-interval. It makes the film seem longer than it actually is. Which also means any longer and the film would have suffered. So, the editing was necessary but not necessarily done well. Despite that there is enough in the film to warrant a trip to the theater if dark, pulp-type fiction is your kind of entertainment.

Possibly an instruction manual outlining the secrets of the Buddha fist and the Hollow Palm technique!
Jet Li and Jackie Chan star in the Forbidden Kingdom and since they are such big stars we get them twice over! Jet Li and Jackie Chan have both got double roles in this rollicking, adventure movie aimed at the summer crowd who would enjoy a good action fantasy.   The script follows the format of the Journey of the Hero as outlined by Joseph Campbell, and is simple.  The director does not waste time in building character and goes straight to the point.  There is a bad guy, the Jade Emperor, and then there are an unlikely collection of misfits including a drunker scholar (Jackie Chan), a silent monk (Jet Li), a beautiful girl (Yifei Liu), and the teen protagonist (Michael Angarano), who is the only one who does not know any kungfu.    Throw in a white haired witch (BingBing Li) and what you have is a potent mixture.  The story is ostensibly based on characters from Chinese mythology and the characters exist to drive the plot.  Unlike other Jackie Chan films, the tone of the film does not have too much of slapstick except in some sequences, and remains true to the Jackie Chan code of not showing blood and gore ( a principle that was ignored in Jackie Chan’s film The Myth).  Jet Li is his inscrutable self in the beginning and then becomes comical possibly under Jackie’s influence.  The title sequence of the film is over laid on posters from Kung Fu films of the 70 and 80’ and one quickly recognizes Gordon Liu from 36 Chamber of Shaolin, and of course, the Boss – Bruce Lee.  Having paid his tributes, the director then throws in references to the kung fu styles seen in thousands of films, with names like the Drunken Fist ( remember Jackie Chan’s Drunken Master), the Tiger style, the Eagle ( Snake in the Eagle’s shadow, again with Jackie Chan), and the Preying Mantis.
Woo – Ping Yuen, the acclaimed martial arts choreographer of the Matrix and Kill Bill series, not to forget Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon delivers superbly.  He keeps the action restrained and does not go for over the top indulgences.  Thus we do not get to see people flying around and neither are there seemingly impossibly leaps and maneuvers.  What we get instead is good realistic action set pieces with superb kung fu: terrific blows, blocks, weapons of various sorts being deployed including jade darts and long hair, and the kung fu staple of leg to leg action.  The fight between Jet Li and Jackie Chan is terrific, with both heroes getting a chance to show off their skills to the hilt without over doing it.  Woo also keeps the fight sequences short and tight, thus keeping the average viewer’s interest in mind.  The film has none of the high philosophy and romantic lyricism of Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; neither does it have the dark, brutal undercurrents of films like Old Boy and Romeo Must Die.  It is also not a classic kung fu chopstick film in that it does not have extended fight sequences in various kung fu styles and the standard ingredients of revenge and retribution.  What it does have is good fun, great fights, and two of the biggest stars of contemporary martial arts displaying their mastery.  It also has some Zen dialogues, and a message: a simplistic one perhaps, but one that will definitely warm the cockles of one’s heart!

But for the melodrama and the technical stuff that seems just too implausible.,"Whether or not it's true war story, The Ghazi Attack makes for a decent thriller. Once you have accepted all the technical jargon as true, that is. There is so much of the latter that believing the story is true becomes more and more difficult with every passing minute. Sure, sonar technology is mind-boggling and all the things shown might even be possible. There can still be no excuse for overt drama as the film progresses in a film that otherwise seemed to have been avoiding it. War films with an undercurrent of mutiny always make for interesting stories. Your sensitivity is hooked from the word go because you know which country your loyalties lie with. But you are debating what side to be on, in the mutiny. What makes a person become a soldier? You can't deny him his patriotism once he is on the field. Is it wrong then, for him to follow his passion – of slaying the enemy without provocation? But if soldier were to follow this passion of theirs, there would be mayhem. These are the philosophies you are struggling with as you see the war between discipline-orders vs. killer instinct with an agenda. This build-up is thoroughly engaging, even if the end is mighty predictable from the beginning. However, post-interval this gives way to melodrama that you would expect in a typical war film. That is disappointing at first and gets boring soon enough. Then, our beliefs in bravery and a human body's physical capacity are tested.The melodrama of course, seeps into the performances – from dialogue delivery to glistening eyes to exaggerated expressions. In a shot earlier in the film, for instance Atul Kulkarni is flustered between what he thinks might be right and what his commander (Kay Kay Menon) is commandeering. Without a line you know why Kulkarni is doing what he is doing. Come second half though, you see him lecture another officer in an extremely affected manner. The tone of the film sinks into the regular fare, from a controlled, nuanced clash of characters. Fortunately, the visual texture of the film stays the same. The film alternates between the murky blue, deep sea and the cringy, clanky, claustrophobic insides of a submarine without any respite. This makes the film stand out from the usual Hindi films and helps it stay true to what it wants to be – an uncomfortable, edgy watch. If only, the consistency in tone had stuck through the other departments of the film – especially the writing.

Yet, it could have been told better. ","Would I be saying anything new at all when I say, the book is better – in the way it unfolds and in the nuances you know about the character. So, given that the book is almost always better and you cannot possibly unread a book, I'd say, if you haven't read the book and don't intend to, the movie, The Girl On The Train might just be worth the thrill. It doesn't take the usual path of a thriller suspense. It starts of with you wondering about the protagonist as she mulls in a train and talks about her obsession with the people who live by the track. And it slowly builds up about specific people who live by the track and so on. You are slowly introduced to two other women and the live they lead. But you don't get to know them too well – what do they think or like. They seem sort-of coincidental to the film. I would have liked to know them better. It is a good thing though that the characters are well-cast. Emily Blunt (Rachel), Haley Bennett (Megan) and Rebecca Ferguson (Anna) do well with the sketchy character sketches drawn for them. However, it felt like the camera did a lot of their work for them. It shook and held steady to show Rachel's drunk and sober phases. It moved a voyeuristic gaze over Megan to bring her sensuousness to us. Unfortunately, though the story doesn't take that further. It becomes an episodic narration of one thing after another with a bit of back and forth in the timeline. It might leave you a little disoriented but never disinterested. If only the big reveal came a little smoothly. If you haven't guessed already, yes – almost each of those sentences above could end with “unlike in the book”. Even if the book isn't the greatest read there is.

Whether the film stacks up to its expectations is a different story altogether. But watch it with a blank mind, and you might just take something away from it.","Everyone in Gyan Correa’s The Good Road is lost. But spend a second introspecting about your own life and you might just ask yourself, “Do even I really know where I am?” The harsh highway in Gujarat, then, that forms the setting for the stories in The Good Road is quite likely a metaphor for life itself. And, as a character quite rightly says in the film, there are so many highways in India - so many lives and so many stories just waiting to be told.David, Kiran and their 7-year-old son Aditya are a young family from Mumbai on a vacation to Gujarat. A twist of circumstance leads Aditya to be separated from his parents, and he ends up traveling with Pappu and Shaukat - a pair of truckers who are on a bit of a mission of their own, so to speak. Then there’s Poonam, a little girl on her way to meet her grandmother in Athangasa, who unfortunately ends up exactly where a little 11-year-old girl by herself must not go.The three stories wind around each other to form the film’s narrative – simple, sparse tales that, bit by bit, reveal a little about the characters as they voice their thoughts and apprehensions. Pappu, Shaukat and Aditya, for instance, develop a strange relationship as they spend time with each other. Aditya, in particular, makes you see that divisions and a sense of ‘us and them’ is something that you truly develop only as you grow older. The innocence of a child is always a great leveler – it almost never distinguishes between two people based on exterior factors that us adults are most likely to spot.There is no attempt at a graph, no attempt at infusing any drama into the film. Quite like life itself, the film just trudges along based on what a particular characters believes or wants to do at a particular moment. This approach lends a mature tone to The Good Road, though I can completely imagine people finding the narrative too slow for its own good. We in India aren’t too used to films that don’t attempt to create a graph, which don’t try to creep up on the audience with a twist or two, and just go where the characters take them. In that sense, The Good Road is a good example of storytelling for the sake of the story, and not for the sake of the audience. That being said, one can’t but help feel that if you are relying so heavily on characters and their relationships to drive a story, it becomes absolutely imperative for every character to actually stay in character and behave in character. Many a time there are instances where you notice the characters avoid the most obvious logical steps to take in a situation, instead they do something completely counter-intuitive. The screenplay of the film, then, ends up striking too many false notes – strange, considering that it was developed at one of Film Bazaar Screenwriters’ Lab of 2008.The film also suffers from some unimpressive key performances. Ajay Gehi has always been a bit too overenthusiastic in front of the camera. Here, as David, he does pretty much the same thing. Sonali Kulkarni, who always manages to convey just the right amount of emotion, does well, despite her small role. Little Keval Katrodia as Aditya charms you with his naivety. The real letdown is Shamji Dhana Kesaria as Pappu. The relationship Pappu develops with Aditya is heartwarming, but doesn’t quite have the intended effect because Kesaria is plain expressionless. Priyank Upadhyay, who plays his sidekick Shaukat, is an absolute natural, though. Some of the other minor characters who appear through the film are supposedly locals who were made to act, and the rawness shows often.The film, however, benefits immensely from the sun-bathed landscape of Gujarat, which lends itself to many a poignant frame in the film. In fact, the stark, bare-minimum movement of the camera works really well for the tone of the film, Rather than impressing you outright with gorgeous cinematography, the film lets the composition of frames and the subjects do the talking. A special mention must also be made of the sound design. The film actually relies a lot on the sounds to create a sense of place and time, often even more than the visuals.There aren’t many who pause to think about this, but a film is almost always only as good as what each member of the audience takes with them before experiencing the film. If you don’t usually watch a film for the second time within a few days of your first viewing, then try it once. I can guarantee that the same film will look different based on your state of mind. Keeping this in mind, it becomes extremely difficult to view The Good Road with an objective mindset, considering the furore over its selection as India’s official entry for the Academy Awards’ best Foreign Language Film category after the widespread support, even internationally, for The Lunchbox. Still, I’d urge you to keep all of it out of your mind before catching The Good Road on DVD. While the DVD itself holds nothing more than the film, if you love cinema and like giving different kinds of cinema a shot, then try this one too. Is the film better than The Lunchbox? Debatable, because such questions don’t have a yes-no answer. Is the film good enough to represent India internationally? Probably not. Will it make it to the final Academy Awards shortlist? Almost certainly not. But is the film worth a watch for some gorgeous visuals and sounds, and a rare maturity in its storytelling that rises above the issues in its writing? The honest answer is, “Yes”.

481,1181,1181,1181,1181,The Grand Budapest Hotel,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/grand-budapest-hotel-review/,,,,3.8,"If you’ve loved Wes Anderson’s previous work and you go in with the highest of expectations, there’s still virtually no chance that this, his latest film will not match them. As gorgeous as ever, as zany as ever, The Grand Budapest Hotel is another proud entrant into the Anderson oeuvre. ","One always approaches a Wes Anderson film with trepidation. There are expectations, yes; but there are also those lingering fears: Will the bubble burst? Will the new world that you’re about to enter enchant like the previous one he created? Will he finally cross the thin line that his indulgent attention to seemingly pointless detail treads? But then, I suppose that’s the hallmark of a true visionary – that once you’re inside the cinema and the lights dim, everything else fades away, and you’re sucked in.The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the most gorgeous films you can hope to see on the big screen. Beautifully staged, meticulously crafted frames that blend into each other like clockwork (each more captivating than the other), a universe of its own with enticingly flawed characters that inhabit it; all the staple Anderson tropes are there. Yet, he just seems to get better with each film. Set in three different time periods, the longest of which is in pre-World War II Europe, The Grand Budapest Hotel is essentially a caper film – it has robbery, murder, jailbreak, mystery, love, brotherhoods, wills and heirs and everything else that can glue one to their seat. And with the Anderson flourish, it becomes an experience all its own.Ralph Fiennes plays Gustave, a concierge at the titular hotel – a man gifted with words, women and a natural magnetic charm that makes him a leader. Looking at him with wide-eyed awe is an oddly named bell boy Zero. It is their escapades that propel the film, as they battle the likes of a deadly assassin and the Anderson reimagining of the Nazi SS – the ZZ – and we watch a story within a story, gobsmacked at the sheer beauty and craft on display.There’s also the subtle humour laced through the film, as characters stop in the middle of the tensest of situations to ponder on something unnecessary (but never irrelevant). In fact, Anderson’s penchant for humour is quite unparalleled, as long as you’re only looking for the slightest of smiles to remain plastered on your face through the length of the film.But even in his crazed other-world where characters are the kind you’ve never seen before, they’re always written beautifully, rock-solid to the last ‘d’. You never once feel that a character behaves in any way that seems out of place for them – and there are plenty of loonies to keep you interested at all times. Even the sinister – almost heartless - aspects of the plot race along merrily with unabashed glee. Here is a filmmaker who can make the pointless murder of a cat seem just a wee bit ticklish. In fact, the manner in which morality is effortlessly reduced to nothing more than a point of view is one of the most interesting aspects of the film, once you’ve left it behind and are letting the experience sink in.The icing, then, is the cast of the film. While Anderson’s staples like Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody and the likes make appearances big and small – and each of them is a delight – the film belongs to Ralph Fiennes and young Tony Revolori who plays Zero. Their timing and spontaneity is impeccable, and they bounce off each other like crazy balls. Special mention must also be made of Willem Defoe’s terrifyingly hilarious look in the film – he plays Jopling, the assassin mentioned earlier.Wes Anderson is one of those rare filmmakers whose every indulgence you’re willing to forgive, simply because of the loving detail he infuses into his frames, shots, scenes and characters. The Grand Budapest Hotel is yet another feather in his colourful and doubtlessly centre-aligned hat.

482,1182,1182,1182,1182,The Great Gatsby,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/great-gatsby-review/,,5/5.0,,4.466666667,"Eye-candy but rarely more, Baz Luhrmann’s The Great Gatsby joins the list of screen adaptations that fail to match up to their literary counterparts. Good performances don’t succeed in elevating the film to where it truly deserved to be, considering the richness of the source. You won’t miss much if you skip the film, though you probably wouldn’t mind giving it a shot if you’ve read and loved the book, or if you’re desperate to see Amitabh Bachchan in his first, albeit miniscule, role in a Hollywood film.","There’s nothing quite like listening to a director talk passionately about his own film. The bonus material in the DVD of The Great Gatsby is a 13-minute featurette that has director Baz Luhrmann talk about his choices and omissions regarding a few scenes that were deleted from the final film. What it did most for me was make me desperately want to revisit the film as well as the book – that’s usually the sign of true love and understanding that a director has for his craft.The film itself, I thought, makes for a better DVD watch if you’ve already watched it on the big screen and were slightly disappointed by it. The 3D is gone, the Luhrmann-esque grandiosity assumes smaller dimensions on a smaller screen, and you can focus a wee bit more on the core of the film – Jay Gatsby and his love for the only true love of his life.Now if only studios and DVD manufacturers would specifically start designing DVDs keeping the Indian market in mind, vis-à-vis languages, subtitles and even packaging. Surely, we’re a large enough market to deserve it!Grandiose, colourful, an orgy of vivid imagery and music, Baz Luhrmann’s big screen adaptation of The Great Gatsby is often wondrous to look at, but lacks what it should have had the most – a gut-wrenching soul. That isn’t to say that the film is unwatchable; but even as a cinematic work independent of the novel it is based on, the film shows far too much promise to be failing as much and as often as it does.The narrative voice-over must be one of the big dilemmas of cinema. Fundamentally uncinematic because of its very nature – if you are going to dictate something, then why have visuals at all – fact remains that some of the most enduring classics through the years have used voice-overs, and they’ve used them well. A quick skim through F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel ‘The Great Gatsby’, on which Baz Luhrmann’s latest film is based, will tell you that considering the style of the book, the film would have to heavily rely on a voice-over to tell its tale.A part of me was secretly hoping that Luhrmann would be able to side-step this and bring what I consider an absolute epic – even though I read the book for the first time only a day before I watched the film – to life. Unfortunately, he does exactly what was expected; in fact, the opening lines of the film (voice-over, of course) have been taken from the book verbatim. By no means is the use of a voice-over the biggest problem with the film though.The film is narrated by Nick Carraway, a World War I veteran who is now back in New York, who recounts his experiences with one Mr. Gatsby, an enigmatic man who everyone seems to know of, but no one really knows. A film that is, at its heart, a story of enduring love and the sheer power that such love holds within itself, the competent ensemble cast keeps things at least marginally interesting all through the film. However, the film’s big failure is that it just doesn’t touch you, considering the emotional heft that the story in itself has.Luhrmann displays a remarkable command over the medium, playing with it visually as well as aurally, succeeding in developing a fairly interesting narrative method. He also recreates not just the period that the film is set in, but the environment and feel that of the novel as well. The film also has a terrific soundtrack, one that focuses more on the mood and the emotions than on any sort of faithfulness to the era in which it is set.However, while the 3D of the film isn’t visually poor as is usually the case, I fail to see the point of shooting this film in 3D. If anything, this film is hampered by the 3D more than most other films, because the glasses almost act like a barrier between the audience and the characters. At the heart of the epic-like exterior lies a core of pure love, one that deserved to be laid out for the audience without having additional encumbrances as distractions. The 3D is a poor technical choice (quite understandable though, considering Luhrmann’s background in theatre and the larger-than-life manner in which he usually treats his films.)As I said earlier, the one thing that kept me continuously interested in the film were the performances; while Tobey Maguire as the narrator Nick Carraway is functional – he seems to be getting distinctly repetitive in his expressions, delivery and posture lately – the supporting cast comprising of Joel Edgerton and Carrey Mulligan, who play the husband-wife pair of Tom and Daisy Mulligan, are terrific, as is Jason Clarke in a tiny little role. Edgerton, in particular, is such a fine actor that it seems like a terrible waste that he doesn’t have more films written specifically for him. Amitabh Bachchan’s appearance is expectedly brief, and watching him on the big screen with another of my favourite actors – who 
I will come to in a bit – was a joy. Not surprisingly, he has a strange accent as well, but between his delivery and his baritone, it doesn’t really jar.Leonardo DiCaprio simply aces it as the enigmatic Jay Gatsby. Not nearly as good as some of his other performances (his most recent turn as Calvin Candie in Django Unchained, for example), he still pulls it off with such ease and conviction that he almost single-handedly manages to infuse some of the lost emotion into the film - not nearly enough to achieve what the story and novel deserved, but his performance works nonetheless. Also, a special mention must go to Callan McAuliffe who plays a teenaged Jay Gatsby. Though his role is brief, he is uncannily convincing as a young Leo. I expect most people to be underwhelmed by the film, while some will probably find it downright boring. However, I do expect those who’ve read the novel to be intrigued by the film at various points during the runtime. There are portions where Luhrmann displays snatches of brilliance in the text-to-screen adaptation of the material, while largely he seems to have missed a trick or two when it comes to capturing the soul of the text. And yes, my conscience won’t permit me to end this without strongly recommending F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel to anyone who is in love with the written word!

483,1183,1183,1183,1183,The Green Hornet,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/green-hornet-review/,,3/5.0,,3.8,"The Green Hornet is the movie you should go and watch if you don’t mind watching a senseless but fun flick. But if you would even try to make any sort of sense out of the movie, you’re in for a huge disappointment. The movie is inspired from the radio show and a TV series by the same name. But unlike them, it fails to live up to its potential. With names like Christoph Waltz, Seth Rogen and Cameron Diaz involved, you want it to be so much more than it actually is. Its still quite enjoyable to watch for its cranky humor and sleek action sequences. ","The Green Hornet was a radio show back in 1930s, which later translated into a comic book series, a television series and now a movie. When a concept has been working well for the audiences in so many variants for decades, you’d think its real hard to screw that up now with all the technology at your disposal. This film almost manages to amaze you by doing just that. ‘Almost’ being the key-word here, as its still a good fun-filled mindless action movie, but nowhere near as awesome as the other forms of the franchise. After The Incredibles, there have been plenty of flicks that have experimented with the superhero concept. Some have been successful (Kick-Ass, Megamind, etc) while others have miserably failed (Epic Movie, Underdog, etc). The Green Hornet lies somewhere in between because it has Seth Rogen as Brett Reid, a.k.a The Green Hornet, as the egocentric cocky billionaire with daddy issues and a hero complex (sounds familiar?) who fits into your pop-culture superhero perfectly; and on the other hand you have Jay Chou as Kato, his faithful partner, who does all the hard-work from kicking the bad guys to building weapons, cars, coffee-machines, pretty much everything as if he was born to be a superhero. An idiot with a big mouth and a kung-fu god, has been a trusted formula for success but it falls a little short for this film. A very mundane screenplay and under-utilization of the actors is to blame.Seth Rogen is the lead actor, writer and producer for the film. And with great power, comes greater screen-time. He is all over the movie. I like Seth Rogen, I do, but when you have an immensely talented actor like Christoph Waltz and a looker like Cameron Diaz on your team, you ought to give them time to shine too. Cameron is totally wasted in the film with very little screen time for her to do anything meaningful. She makes most of what she’s got though. Christoph Waltz is the reason, I insist you watch the film rather than just let it go. The guy is a powerhouse of talent. He’s done an excellent job at being the self-conscious psychopathic crime boss. For me, the most memorable scene of the movie is between him and James Franco in his cameo (another very talented guy). If only James had a longer role, this movie would have done wonders. Jay Chou had Bruce Lee’s shoes to fill in, who played Kato in the television series. Needless to say they are pretty-darn big and near impossible shoes to fill in. He does a respectable job though, and is awesome in action sequences. But I’m so not a fan of the red-eye thing they’ve inserted in every action sequence. Sometimes technology works against you. Michel Gondry (director) could have done a much better job. Music score of the film is great. Soundtrack had many songs I grew up listening to.Its a good action flick with enough comic moments to satisfy you. But has nothing much to remember it by. Watch on DVD for sure.

484,1184,1184,1184,1184,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/hobbit-unexpected-journey-review/,,5/5.0,,4.466666667,"Gargantuan in scale and vision, the first of Peter Jackson’s The Hobbit trilogy is more of a set-up piece for the remaining films. Unhurried in its pace, the film introduces the enchanting world, the eccentric characters and the adventures that they will eventually face. With rich detailing, immaculate art and terrific 3D, the film makes for a good theatrical watch, but there will certainly be complaints that the first Hobbit film doesn’t nearly pack in as much excitement as any of the LOTR films.","Update: While filmmakers have been shooting at higher frame rates for quite a while now, this is the first time that an entire feature film is being projected theatrically at 48 frames per second, dubbed as HFR for projection purposes. (Currently, only select INOX theatres and Sathyam in Chennai are HFR-ready.) Experiencing The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey in HFR 3D has its pros and cons. It works well in action sequences and in shots where there is camera movement. The higher 48 FPS frame rate means that motion becomes far smoother and action is easier to watch. However, 48 FPS also seems to improve image clarity, which often makes it easy to discern shots where the lighting is artificial and where sets/VFX are used. Simply put, filmmakers will have to be far more careful if they intend to continue using HFR in the future. More effort will be required to seamless blend live action and locations with CG. As far as The Hobbit is concerned, there will be those who complain that HFR looks 'too much like video'. For most, the overall experience will seem far more familiar and enjoyable in regular 24 FPS, which our eyes are so accustomed to. Personally speaking, I will not dismiss HFR so early on in its existence, considering that I got goose-bumps at exactly the same places while watching it the second time round in HFR, as I did the first time when I watched it in good ol' 24.My best friends are Ron and Hermione. My name, of course, is Harry Potter. But even I would have to admit that ‘The Lord of the Rings’ is arguably the greatest bit of fantasy writing in history. Brought to life by Peter Jackson’s stunning vision in the form of his cinematic trilogy, the films themselves occupy a rare pedestal when it comes to films adapted from literature. Now, Jackson is back. With the first of his trilogy of films based on The Hobbit, the prequel to J R R Tolkien’s most famous epic, Jackson transports us back to the magical Middle-Earth; a world of dragons and Dwarves, of wizards and Orcs. A 3D world of fantasy and adventure, one so breathtaking that it engulfs you, if you are willing to let go. Bilbo Baggins the Hobbit is happy in his hole and his world, until adventure comes knocking in the form of Gandalf the wizard and a motley crew of Dwarves. As we are introduced to the conflict in the Dwarves’ history and why this journey is necessary for them to undertake, the reluctant Bilbo is drawn into it as well, and the barmy pack of characters set off for an intriguing hunt for gold and the pursuit of the dragon Smaug. Linear and fairly simplistic in its narrative, this first film primarily acts as a preamble for the grandeur and excitement of the adventures that the two subsequent films will doubtlessly hold. As Gandalf mysteriously tells Bilbo, “I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure…” what he is really doing is asking us, the viewers, to join him in the world that Tolkien’s and Jackson’s respective imaginations have created.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is primarily held together by bewitching imagery embellished with remarkable 3D; the film virtually transports you to Middle-Earth. The eccentric characters and the comic tone of the film are charming, and are helped greatly by the performances. Martin Freeman takes little time to shake off any image you have of him as Watson from BBC’s contemporary Sherlock adaptation and slips into the role of the younger Bilbo with ease. His mannerisms and expressions are perfect, and infinitely more likeable than that of Elijah Wood, who appears in a very brief reprisal of his role as Frodo. For hardcore LOTR fans, there are also cameos by Elrond (Hugo Weaving), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) and the likes, not to mention Andy Serkis’ deliciously twisted, motion-capture return as Gollum. My personal favourite, of course, is Ian McKellen’s Gandalf the Grey. The thespian, as always, brings that air of mystique and indefatigable character that is Gandalf the wizard. His disappearances and reappearances bring about a sense of alternating loss and reassurance, of magical involvement with Bilbo and the Dwarves who depend so much on the towering presence that the character has. Undeniably, the film works more to make you reminisce about the far more frenetic and heart-pounding experience of the earlier trilogy, because the film suffers from one big problem that is hard to ignore when you gauge it objectively. While personally, the leisurely pace of the film didn’t bother me because I enjoyed the vicarious fantastical experience that I was offered, there will undoubtedly be those who will find the pace of the film tedious. Only those truly taken in by Tolkien-verse will fully be able to appreciate the film. Whether the film will work for you or not depends entirely on how much you like involving yourself in the experience that is cinema.The Lord of the Rings was a novel just shy of 1400 pages, and it took three movies to make a respectable cinematic adaptation of it. The Hobbit, in comparison, isn’t even 300 pages long and is still being made into three movies. Crudely put, each ‘Hobbit’ film has just about one-fifth of how much each LOTR film had. The choice to make three films out of the book, then, seems more financially driven than creatively. After all, each film is most certainly going to rake in billions worldwide.But those concerns are for the practical, the rational and the cynical. For those who love living characters and mentally inhabiting places of enigma and fantasy, An Unexpected Journey works well. The songs of the Dwarves, the quirks of our lovable Hobbit, Gandalf’s immense aura and the obstacles that they face along their journey will enchant you. Jackson’s assured hand at recreating the world that he is so clearly besotted by more than most, makes some scenes and set pieces truly stand out. The familiar background score, very reminiscent of the LOTR films, aids further in making you live that world.Also, what the film really does is set things up nicely for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and The Hobbit: There and Back Again. In the larger scheme of things, when one wants to revisit the Tolkien-Jackson universe years later, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is where they would start, and it is a worthy introduction to the world of magic and adventure that they will be sucked into over the nearly 20 hours of cinema that they will eventually experience.

","Strange that just a year ago, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was easily the most awaited film of the year, while the second film of the trilogy, The Desolation of Smaug, has arrived with not more than a whimper in comparison. Luckily, the film more than lives up to the promise shown by the first film, which, while being an engaging visual and emotional experience in itself, was more of a set up piece than anything else. What is it about watching a bunch of souls on a dangerous quest for something that they believe in, the moral questions behind it be damned? What is it about the most basic concepts like courage, brotherhood, good and evil, which make a well-told story involving them become so immersive?Yes, the Tolkien adaptations have the advantage of being adequately armed with fodder for spectacularly inviting imagery, but surely that can't be all? Surely it is more about the emotions evoked than about breathtakingly executed visuals?   This time, we rejoin Gandalf, Bilbo, Thorin and his band of Dwarves - less merrier this time round - as they continue on their quest that began in the previous film. Their destination, of course, is Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, where lies the great dreaded dragon, Smaug. Their journey, however, is fraught with peril.What makes The Desolation of Smaug so much more engaging is that it is far darker than An Unexpected Journey, which actually had so much of understated humour in it. It also is far quicker paced, and it completely ups the action and adventure set pieces; so much that the first film actually seems rather tame in comparison.Watch out, in particular, for one terrific, high-octane sequence involving Orcs, Elves, Dwarves and a raging river. It is easily one of the most jaw-droppingly imagined action scenes of the year - even better than the one where Wolverine had a bit of fun on the top of a Bullet Train earlier this year. This scene, and indeed, so many others in the film, make your heart surge quite like the river that was mentioned earlier. It helps that the 3D this time is even better. What remains to be seen is how this film looks in HFR.The Desolation of Smaug also takes a lot more liberties with the source material than the previous film, but then that's something for only hardcore Tolkien fans to talk about. As far as it being the intermediate film in the trilogy goes, it is a bit of a roller coaster, giving you almost no time to breathe as the Dwarves and Bilbo hurtle towards their showdown with Smaug.And when Smaug is finally shown in all his glory; well, what can one say? Superbly voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, Smaug the dragon has been designed and executed with such persona and awe that it is hard to take your eyes off him. If Gandalf and Thorin were the scene-stealers in An Unexpected Journey, The Desolation of Smaug belongs to Smaug.It won't be surprising, however, if the film manages to exhaust at least some part of the audience. The fact remains that it hardly ever eases up on the action, and most of the action scenes are quite long as well. The film, despite its fast pace, would have been far more appreciated if it was shorter - at least a couple of action scenes chopped out would surely not have hurt. While I'm personally not complaining - l loved every bit of the high energy portions of the film - it would have perhaps made more sense for the film to be slightly less bloated with all that action. Remember, Jackson has already been under fire for making a relatively tiny book into three whole films. Luckily, the film ends on a high - you're left with bated breath for the final chapter of the trilogy. Danger is brewing in Middle Earth, and The Desolation of Smaug literally leave you right at the brink of it. If Peter Jackson now intends to take the adventure up a notch, then The Hobbit: There and Back Again is poised to be a true epic.Update: HFR Viewing This time round, Peter Jackson and Co seem to have taken cognizance of and fixed at least some of the issues that An Unexpected Journey had with its HFR. In The Desolation of Smaug, the 'fakeness', which was a major complaint about the look of the first film, has actually gone down. That TV-like quality because of the sharpness and smooth frame rate is also lesser. And of course, the big plus point of HFR - better visibility in fast action scenes - works well for this film, which has enough action going for it. All in all, HFR isn't quite perfect yet, but baby steps are being made, in case filmmakers are serious about it as a long-term technical innovation in cinema.

486,1186,1186,1186,1186,The Host,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review,/movie/host-review/,,,,3.8,"Another Stephenie Meyer novel has been turned into a film; and if Twilight was polarizing in its love/hate for the series, Andrew Niccol’s The Host is likely to be almost universally regarded as one of the silliest films in recent times; competing and perhaps even beating David Dhawan’s murder of the classic Chashme Buddoor, if possible.","The Host, based on a novel by Stephenie ‘Twilight’ Meyer and directed by Andrew Niccol, is easily one of the silliest films you’ll see all year. A sappy, puke-inducing romance set in a future where aliens have invaded Earth and have taken over the bodies of nearly every human being, save for a few. The only thing the film has even remotely going for it is that the visuals don’t tire you, even if nearly everything else about the film makes you want to pull your hair out. The film tells us the story of Melanie, a human whose body is now host to an alien soul; that, by the way, is the modus operandi of these aliens. Except that the feisty Melanie is one of the rare humans who is able to fight the alien - an inner battle that occurs between two souls in one body. The reason for this? Didn’t I mention something about puke earlier?One of the fundamental flaws in the film, one that anyone with even a quarter of a squid’s brain will wonder about, is why exactly we have a problem with these aliens. They are largely peace-loving, and an opening voiceover tells us that these aliens have actually done planet Earth a world of good; there is no violence at all, and the Earth is more beautiful than ever before. In fact, the film is actually a celebration of the glorious faults of humankind. We are greedy, violent beings, who often succumb to carnal calls, who will invariably break the rules and who won’t think twice about putting loads of other human lives in danger, if it benefits us individually in some way. The ‘aliens’ are the exact opposite, not to mention the fact that they are far more technically advanced than us. Yet, somehow, the film tries to sell us the fact that humans deserve to rule the earth far more than these aliens do.That apart, the romance aspect of the film is so inane, so absolutely silly, that all you want is for everyone in love in the film to die; a gruesome death. Unfortunately for us, that doesn’t seem to be the way Stephenie Meyer operates. I must confess, I’ve never watched or read anything of the Twilight series. And considering how it is a standing joke in pop culture, I’ve always wondered just how bad is Twilight any way. Well, if Twilight is even half as silly as The Host, I’m glad I stayed away from it.What’s surprising is Andrew Niccol’s decision to direct this film. I’ve liked a number of his previous films, not just the ones he’s directed, but the ones he’s written as well. The former include cult hit Lord of War, the cerebral Gattaca, and even that guilty indulgence In Time, while the latter include films like The Terminal and The Truman Show, amongst others. He’s always seemed to have a fondness for films set in the future, and he’s almost always managed to make them reasonably convincing. The Host, however, is an unmitigated disaster. It doesn’t help at all that not one of the characters and faces in the film appeal to you in any way. The way the characters have been written, and the performances of the cast - both are mostly bland. Only William Hurt and Diane Kruger from the supporting cast make any impact. Saoirse Ronan, who plays Melanie and who has to virtually anchor the film throughout, tries her best, but really comes up quite short.Even for a sci-fi film, The Host is filled with so many logical inconsistencies and screenplay problems that you’re all but waiting for the film to just get over as soon as possible, perhaps so that you can flush away the experience of the film at the earliest. In fact, if there really existed an alien race like the one in the film and if they ever saw The Host, they’d probably break their own non-violent ethics and shoot themselves in the head.

487,1187,1187,1187,1187,The Hours,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/the-hours-review/,,,,3.8,"I urge you to try and read Mrs. Dalloway before you watch The Hours. More than the novel of the same name (of which the movie is quite the direct adaptation), Mrs Dalloway gives you an in-depth insight into Woolf’s style of writing and the intricacies of the character of Clarissa Dalloway – on whom the three characters in the film are based. The Hours celebrates complexity and inquiry. It can leave you gloomy and brimming with existential questions. Be warned, but don’t miss the film – it’s an experience I highly recommend. ","In 1941, Sussex, England, celebrated feminist author Virginia Woolf puts rocks in her pockets and drowns herself in a river. Of the many floating speculations, the largely accepted reason for this suicide was Woolf’s much talked about paranoia. Her style and her works have been widely adapted and made into theatrical plays and feature films – yet, only one such film manages to capture the exact concoction of feminism, fiction and bizarre eccentricity that was Virginia Woolf – The Hours. The movie, based on the novel of the same name by Michael Cunningham, is based on three women who are connected by the segregated souls of a character from Woolf’s novel Mrs. Dalloway – Clarissa Dalloway. The film is also divided into three time zones. In 2002, there is Clarissa Vaughan (played by Meryl Streep), a New Yorker who prepares a party for her AIDS-stricken friend Richard (Ed Harris). In 1950s Los Angeles there is Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) who is pregnant and vastly dissatisfied in her marriage. Then there is Woolf herself (played by Nichole Kidman), in the 1920s in England, and we see her struggling with her depression and mental paranoia.All three characters are connected – like three lost souls swimming in a fish bowl. They are different aspects of the one character in Woolf’s novel. Clarissa Dalloway is an over-analytical, submissive, bi-curious, complex woman and these aspects have been stripped into three vital characters. Moore, Streep and Kidman adapt to their cultural and social time zones perfectly and yet stay true to their complexity, because The Hours is a complex film. It’s a film that delves deep into the psyche of these these characters and their battle with their complicated selves. Parallel narratives guide the film, while we get a strong whiff of every character’s thought processes and questions. It’s a technique that Woolf was famous for – stream of consciousness – the ability to write freely as the character thinks. Director Stephen Daldry adapts this technique well, as you feel you are visually entering the minds of these three women, carefully observing their every thought and every dilapidated query. The Hours is essentially a celebration of complexity of thought. You may not be going in any direction, plot-wise, with the film. You will just find yourself walking around in circles, dissecting every thought-bubble that the film tries to present to you. The most important thing that The Hours does is make you question. The kind of spooky questioning that lets you lie in bed, stare at the ceiling and just think – What is acceptable behavior and what is not? The existential question that rides all our backs – what is life about? What am I doing with mine? More than that, the film offers you three different approaches to sexuality, suicide, depression and three different versions of the same women who have those approaches.The DVD of The Hours has some interesting features: An audio commentary by Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Nicole Kidman and 4 Featurettes: Three Women, The Mind and Times of Virginia Woolf, The Music of The Hours, The Lives of Mrs. Dalloway. All four featurrettes are small and explanatory. It provides as a great post-movie viewing as it puts a lot of things into perspective if you haven’t read Mrs Dalloway or The Hours.What makes The Hours a must watch, over the novel, are the performances. Kidman is absolutely engrossing, as Virgina Woolf (you might not even recognize her with her nose being drastically tampered with), playing the desolate, complex part. I would go ahead and say she is the best performer in the film, even ahead of Streep, who looks like she got up from her sleep to play this part. Streepis effortless and extremely likeable – a concrete emotion that Clarissa Dalloway doesn’t draw. Julianne Moore looks her demure and confused part. Watch The Hours most certainly not for entertainment, but for the deep and difficult questioning of those very human emotions we take for granted.

488,1188,1188,1188,1188,The Hunger Games,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review2 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/hunger-games-review/,,3/5.0,,3.8,"Watch The Hunger Games – not just so it can blow your mind away with its un-thinkable premise (for which the book takes credit) but mostly for its representation of a Futuristic America, its ability to hold a mirror to our urban practices to make us question our existence as it stands. ","The best thing about a science fiction/fantasy film is not in its ability to make us imagine. It’s the ability that a film has to represent what we consider “human” or “normal” in a deliriously make-believe manner. The Hunger Games stumps you with its basic idea, but once you move beyond its premise, it manages to captivate you with the manner in which the message is told. For its ability to push you to fantasize beyond your regular boundaries of imagination, The Hunger Games is two and a half hours of intellectually-fuelled fantasy that you deserve. The Hunger Games has an extremely disturbing premise. Set in the futuristic city of Panem in America, based on the sci-fi novel of the same name written by Suzanne Collins, the movie revolves around the Annual Hunger Games. The Capitol city conducts The Hunger Games every year, to remind the 12 districts constituting Panem, of their authority and power.  24 teenagers or “tributes” as they are called are pitted against each other in the jungles in a survival-of-the-fittest type reality show, and only one emerges winner. As they battle it out, blood-wars and deceptions included, the people of the Capitol city celebrate it as a sporting event. 
The point is well made in your head by then, as an audience. You are indirectly told that a harsh remark is being made at the idea of urbanization. By the time the 24 teens enter the jungles you are well acquainted with the bizarre practices of the Capitol city. 
The film up till this point holds your attention, allows you to enter a world that is magnificently mocking and makes you sit-up and draw comparisons between Capitol City and planet Earth. But the moment the 24 kids enter the jungles, each adventure then becomes a tad bit predictable. A predictability that works but because it has such a meticulously-stimulating first half, it’s almost as if you’re transported into a different film. 
The two lead “tributes” Katniss Evergreen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are shown to be in love, because the Capitol authorities believe the audiences want something to hope for – they soon have a romance angle that is staged for the purpose of entertainment. It makes you want to feel ashamed of being a part of a generation that celebrates facades, and staged realities. The action in the jungle sequence has a few endearing moments too. – with relationships brewing between participants, in a situation of absolute rivalry. 
Oscar-nomited Jennifer Lawrence (As Katniss) brings the desired poker-faced burdened performance to her character – you immediately empathize with her, and hence agree with every move she makes during the games. In that sense, it’s important that the film’s protagonist makes that connection with its audience, which Lawrence manages well. 
As a film set in a post-apocalyptic future, The Hunger Games makes for a visual delight. With gritty, high intensity shots of the jungles that serve as a stark opposite to the urban “jungle” of the Capitol, the picture leaves you spell-bound. 
The Hunger Games is captivating in that it allows us to place a mirror at our own “evolved” practices. The representation of the people of the Capitol is remarkably innovative and even though a little loud you don’t question the colored mustaches, the golden eye make-up – as they all serve as facades that we, as urban, bureaucratic puppets, often wear. The Hunger Games then is a well-thought, ingenious film with a promise of a sequel that I am waiting for with bated breath.

Jennifer Lawrence is a treat to watch, and her Katniss Everdeen is a character worth rooting for.","What a hero Katniss Everdeen is! She's bold, fearless, righteous and talented; she's also rash, impulsive and unsure. A heady cocktail of grey and white, she's the kind of hero our cinema has sorely lacked. She also reminds us of what a pity it is that we've had so few genuine female heroes in the fiction of our times. Yes, the situations around her often seem conveniently conducive for her heroism to thrive. And yet, one can't help rooting for her, because she's that rare protagonist whose conflicts often mirror our own. Mostly though, it is the sight of her relishing a challenge that truly makes her a delight.Catching Fire takes off from 2012's The Hunger Games, based on the continuing novel by Suzanne Collins. After the 74th Hunger Games that saw Katniss and Peeta emerge as joint winners at the end of the previous film, the pair are now celebrities in all of Panem. President Snow, however, also notices that young Katniss - monickered 'The Girl on Fire' - is also beginning to become a symbol of rebellion against The Capitol; a spark that must be quelled before it becomes a raging fire.With a change of guard at the helm - Francis Lawrence takes over as director for the remainder of the series - Catching Fire seems grittier than the first film. Life in Panem seems more grim, and consequently, the need for a rebellion seems stronger than ever. Simultaneously, the conflict in Katniss's personal life seems to go hand in hand with the unrest in Panem. She doesn't want the two to intersect, and yet, life has placed her at a juncture where the two are nearly one and the same. She's the beacon of hope that the oppressed need to rally around, when all she wants is to be away from it all, with her family and love.Around all of this, the lavish, obnoxious decadence of those in power, and the gloomy existence of those without it, is brought into sharp contrast - at times a little stronger than is completely necessary. The alternating orgy of colour and dull blue-grey monochrome does have its intended effect, despite its obviousness.  The film turns particularly thrilling in its final act - the 75th Hunger Games - which truly takes what we saw in the previous film to a new level; absolute mayhem that keeps you on the edge. Even if, like in the previous film, a lot happens that makes things conveniently easy for Katniss and Peeta. This was one of the problems I had with the first film as well, but it unfortunately seems the kind of liberty the writers and director don't seem to want to take stock of.Catching Fire also has a soundtrack that builds mood and tension throughout the film, all the way till the end credits, which have a few nice tracks that play all along till the end of the roll.Expectedly, Jennifer Lawrence aces it once again as Katniss Everdeen. Fresh from all of the media attention, adulation and that Academy Award for her flakier-than-snow Tiffany in Silver Linings Playbook, the spunky actress just dons Katniss like she and the character were never apart all this while. Josh Hutcherson, meanwhile, has grown well into the character of Peeta, seeming far more confident this time. The supporting cast - Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson and Donald Sutherland in particular - manage to make their respective characters and their strong traits stand out. The excellent Phillip Seymour Hoffman joins the cast of the film, and what a presence he is. His character is one of the most intriguing in the series now, and is likely to play an important role ahead.But mostly, Catching Fire works because it does what an intermediate film in a series must do - it takes things up a notch from the first film, and it sets things up nicely for the next one. And it does so while also being a sharp, emotional and thrilling film all by itself. This, really, is how you light a spark.

490,1190,1190,1190,1190,The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 0/5.0,/movie/hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-review/,,0/5.0,,4.2,"The third and penultimate film of the Hunger Games franchise is the weakest film so far in terms of story and graph, though we get a deeper insight into Katniss Everdeen. Jennifer Lawrence is, expectedly, the best thing about the film yet again.","Most of us have probably heard the story of the man who, many, many years back, was thrown out of a train compartment that he had a rightful ticket to. The man went on to become a rallying point for an entire nation that wished to free itself from colonial rule. If you pause to think, you do wonder whether India would've attained independence if Mohandas Gandhi had been less affronted by the apartheid and racism he faced.The Hunger Games series and its heroine, Katniss Everdeen, are much the same, really. Katniss never wanted to rebel against the oppressive regime that Panem was under. All she wanted to do was protect her sister. Yet, that one little act thrust her into the spotlight, as, by the end of the second film, she became the symbol of rebellion against the Capitol. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 begins almost exactly where Catching Fire left off. Katniss, if you remember, inadvertently disarmed the force field enveloping the arena holding the Games. She was then air-lifted by a group of rebels, much to her chagrin. If you don't have the first clue what I'm talking about, then this film isn't for you anyway, because it makes little attempt to refresh memories. The whole film has been treated with the assumption that the audience is familiar with the first two films (and why not?)More than the first two films, it is this third film in the four-part movie series that really provides an insight into what kind of a person Katniss Everdeen is. It also once again reinforces the sheer talent that Jennifer Lawrence is. One almost feels that if J Law were to face the same situations in real life that Katniss feels in the film, she'd probably react the exact same way. I keep coming back to the word that I always like to use for both the actor and her character - 'spunky'. Righteous, but never self-righteous; shaky but never nervous; angry, but almost never out of control; Katniss is a heroine you'll love more, the more you watch her.Apart from her, though (and the presence of one Phillip Seymour Hoffman), there's little in the film that makes it a must-watch all by itself. It is unavoidable if you're watching the franchise, but it also really conveys very little new, apart from what we figured at the end of Catching Fire - that a revolution is brewing, and Katniss is the Mockingjay - the symbol of this revolution.What's most disappointing about Mockingjay Part 1 is that there is very little action in the film; in fact, there isn't a single large action set piece, just a few isolated little scenes. Yet, what it lacks in action and thrills, it tries to make up for with little things, like an interesting sub-plot about Katniss being filmed for propaganda purposes, with a Leni Riefenstahl-ish female director to boot. Still, nothing can quite make up for the disappointment of not getting to see Everdeen display too much of her archery skills - one of the highlights of the earlier films.Director Francis Lawrence handles the film like a mixed bag. He seems to have a grip over the emotional graph he wants to follow, but the arc of the film itself actually does so little for the overall story, that you sometimes wonder if the novel Mockingjay could have just been made into one film, to neatly wrap the series up as a trilogy. The first two films saw Katniss make giant leaps as she revealed her nerves of steel, her unabashed virtuousness and fierce talent. This one, well, it just seems like a place holder. Hopefully, all the fireworks, excitement and thrill have been left for the final film, which will take us to the conclusion of Katniss Everdeen and Panem's fight for freedom - the kind of fight we're subconsciously so familiar with, but which will always resonate if done well. But for that, Mockingjay Part 2 will have to go many, many notches above Part 1.

491,1191,1191,1191,1191,The Hurt Locker,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review3 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/hurt-locker-review/,,3/5.0,,3.8,Don’t expect a lot of explosions and gunfights in this film. The Hurt Locker is not your typical war movie. It is a film that shows the monotony in the face of danger. Go without any pre-conceived notions and chances are you’ll appreciate the film and empathise with its protagonists.,"There was a time not very long ago when American war movies were all about patriotism and sacrifice. The last few years however have contributed a lot in the changing of this perspective. The noughties began with the fall of the Twin Towers and ended with the Rrecession. Somewhere in between these two grand events Bush started his infamous Iraq campaign that would change the way the world viewed at war. The initial jingoism has now given way to weariness with movies now focusing more on the man in the bunker, as the reasons he was fighting for become more and more meaningless.The Hurt Locker is one such film, set in Iraq and telling the story of an elite bomb disposal squad. It is as much a story of the insecurities of the commandos as it is about the lack of choices for one man -- Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner), who smokes cigarettes and goes about disposing explosives like he’s taking a walk in the park.James is good, heck he’s brilliant -- in tune with the wires and the bombs he is about to defuse, at times even respectful to the person who has assembled the circuit. He is very sure of himself, at times so sure he doesn’t care to wear his protective suit! But he is also very reckless, leaving Sanbourn (Anthony Mackie) the man in charge of watching his back, in a very unenvious position.So there you have, Sanbourn a complete contrast to James, working with him and trying his best to protect him and perhaps his own ulcer.But Hurt Locker isn’t a film that dwells so much on the contrasts as much as it shows the monotony in the face of danger. Director Kathryn Bigelow manages to achieve this with her hand-held camera movements, lack of background score, some superb close-ups and a narrative style that puts you in the heat of things.The Hurt Locker in a sense is not a typical war movie. There aren’t as many explosions you might have wanted and definitely not as many gunfights either. Instead there are portions in this movie when absolutely nothing happens. There is no music and there are very little visuals. At one point the screen goes entirely blank for a good few seconds. The beauty of this film lies in these moments. Bigelow manages to take you right into the scene of action and the slow pace only goes to show how killing anticipation can be. Having said that though, it also must be said that The Hurt Locker isn't a conventional entertainer that will make you walk out of the theatre and say a-ha! It gnaws on you, tests your patience to the point that you want Sanbourn and James to go home. I might also go to the extent of saying that perhaps you might also walk out of the theatre feeling somewhat disappointed because it doesn't fit into the parameters of a 'war movie'. But if you are patient enough and perhaps a little considerate. You might just understand what the sniper lying in one position all day waiting to shoot is going through.The director treads the line between action and suspense very well. You see things from the protagonist’s mind and see just what makes him do what he does. Sure, James is the hero of the film. And for a lot of his colleagues he probably is a war hero? But does he consider himself to be one is a question that Bigelow attempts to answer. And she does a very good job at it.

492,1192,1192,1192,1192,The Iceman,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review,/movie/iceman-review/,,,,3.8,"Michael Shannon’s performance in the title role of a real life contract killer, and the mood that this Ariel Vromen thriller manages to create make it worth a watch, but not for everyone.","Michael Shannon is clearly a complex actor. Staid, stoic and with not exactly the widest range of expressions to offer, he was last seen as the superhero’s archenemy in a recent summer blockbuster. Even there, his ice-cool, steely demeanour was what added an air of menace about him, never mind that the character itself had a moral ambiguity about it, which made it hard to hate or fear him outright.In fact, Ariel Vromen’s The Iceman, a film that premiered internationally last year, probably found its release at this opportune time because of the worldwide visibility that Michael Shannon received courtesy Man of Steel. A dark, brooding character study of a contract killer who manages to keep that part of his identity a secret even from his immediate family, the film’s measured pace, sombre atmosphere and Michael Shannon’s turn as the real life Richard Kuklinski, on whom this film is based, are what hold the film together, despite its rather erratic writing and slight unwieldiness in directorial craft.Of course, what really intrigues you is Richard Kuklinski himself. It is hard to imagine a man who so easily takes up contract killing as a profession, who doesn’t seem to have a moral compass that guides him with regard to the rights and wrongs of his actions. He is absolutely unflappable in the face of a crisis (as long it doesn’t involve his family), and doesn’t hesitate before taking a human life even if it isn’t part of a contract.And yet, Richard Kuklinski was a living, breathing person; a man who took hundreds of lives and who seemed to show no remorse whatsoever. In that sense, The Iceman offers you no real graph. Despite the fact that the film gets its noir feel nearly right, it offers no real plot, no sense of anticipation in terms of a twist or two.A straight, bleak, stark narrative will always feel like a documentation of facts, as opposed to a real story with an emotional core that one can hang on to. The only times one can identify with Richard Kuklinski as a real human being is when he displays his love for his family, and even that is done with a sense of cold detachment. However, director Arial Vromen seems most out of sorts when he is trying to make this juxtaposition between the cold-blooded killer and the family man. This, precisely this, is where Michael Shannon’s performance saves the film.The Iceman was an epithet given to Kuklinski himself, but it can very well apply to Shannon too. His physical appearance changes through the film, but the iciness remains the same. The expressions are minimal, but the emotions he manages to convey even without changing his expression is testament to what a unique actor he is - so much so that the man is literally a part of the mood that the film creates. One almost gets the feeling that just taking him out of the frame would brighten things up a bit. Ray Liotta plays Roy DeMeo, the mob boss who recruits Kuklinski and kickstarts his killing career. Liotta is in terrific form once again, maliciously towering over every other character in the film, even Kuklinski, when they share the frame. Chris Evans, in a completely different avatar as a grungy yet affable killer himself, is excellent in his tiny role. The weak link in the film in terms of choice of actor as well as performance is Winona Ryder, who plays Kuklinski’s wife. Apart from the fact that she doesn’t age one bit through the film, her performance comes across as false one time too many.Despite the interesting one-line premise The Iceman offers, as a film it doesn’t particularly ‘entertain’ you, if that’s what you’re looking for. What it does rather well though, is manage to engage you by creating a dark little world, provided you are willing to submit yourself to it. The Iceman isn’t for everyone; it is mostly for those who don’t mind feeling a little cold deep, deep within.

493,1193,1193,1193,1193,The Imitation Game,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review2 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/imitation-game-review/,,5/5.0,,4.466666667,"The Imitation Game, a biopic on mathematician and code breaker Alan Turing, is a beautifully crafted film; it looks good, sounds great and feels authentic. Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Turing enhances it further. Though it doesn't go as deep into Turing's psyche as it thinks it does, it still makes for a thoroughly engaging film. ","Right at the start of the The Imitation Game, the central character of Alan Turing speaks out in a voice-over, asking someone (as well as you, the audience) to pay attention to whatever is going to follow. This act, of trying to coerce the audience into paying attention and understanding what's being said & shown, either by being blatant about it and stating it aloud as in this case, or by repeatedly reinforcing an already established fact or event, is perhaps the biggest problem with Morten Tyldum's film. It happens time and again throughout. If this had been avoided, and more time was devoted, instead, to unpeeling more facets of Turing's personality, the film could have been a masterclass in how to make a period biopic. Then again, the film as it is currently, still makes for a racy, engaging, at times even heartwarmingly funny, experience.Based on the life of mathematician Alan Turing, whose work in designing and building computing machines played a large part in the Allied Forces' victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, The Imitation Game works because of the stunning real life story of Turing, as well as Benedict Cumberbatch's impassioned portrayal of the man.The most brilliant minds usually belong to the loneliest, most eccentric of people. Alan Turing was what one would consider a 'deviant' in more ways than one. While the bulk of the film is spent on Turing's work in cracking the codes enciphered by the German machine Enigma, the film also flashes back to Turing's youth intermittently, as we get to know a bit of why Turing was as he was in his later years.He was an unsung hero for the longest time, Turing; so the film is emotional, edgy and always intriguing. The film also touches upon a number of sensitive topics that seem just as relevant today than they did back when Turing was alive. The casual but rampant sexism that existed back then, for instance. Again, these are only scratched at the surface.  Eventually, the film does make the point that just how a man and a machine think differently, even two different individuals can think differently. Logically, it follows that there is no right and wrong, no clear moral or social lines, despite what history and society have conditioned us to believe. The Imitation Game gets the period look and feel spot on, but perhaps the biggest contributor to making it truly immersive almost throughout, is Alexandre Desplat's background score. Though it isn't the most original sounding score around, it always works in tandem with the emotional timbre of the scene, playing the role of glue between the hearts of the audience and the characters.Then, there are the performances. Benedict Cumberbatch consumes Turing (or the other way round), with every twitch, every mannerism seeming like it came from somewhere deep within. It isn't a flawless performance, only because one can see shades of his Julian Assange performance here as well. But the soul clearly overshadows the craft, leading to a thoroughly effective portrayal. The gorgeous Keira Knightley, with her crooked teeth and lanky frame, warms your heart with a performance that balances strength with vulnerability.Like I mentioned earlier, one can't help get the feeling that the film doesn't seem to want to go into what Turing really was like deep, deep inside. It delves into plenty of facts, yes, but it could have been so much more powerful if Tyldum hadn't chosen to make a simple story seem like it is a complex tale. The deepest, darkest layers of Alan Turing, it seems, are destined to be an enigma, much like the man himself. This film on his life, though, is a well-crafted, gripping film.

494,1194,1194,1194,1194,The International,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma reviewNotepad1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/the-international-review/,,3/5.0,,3.8,A torpid thriller that fails to ignite any spark whatsoever.,"Hollywood it seems is desperate for new villains.  They have exhausted the Germans, the Russians, the Afghans, the Italians, the East Europeans and not necessarily in that order.  So what is left?  In a post-cold-war world which is marked by increasing fundamentalist movements of all shades, there ostensibly remains only one.  That which was a good friend for so long has now turned into a deadly foe.  Ladies and Gentlemen welcome to the global Banking system as the Villain.  The International is a thriller which articulates this premise in the first few minutes.  Unfortunately, global financial manipulations and a Bank in particular do not a cinematic villain make.  One needs to have characters and faces, quirky, hateful faces if possible.  Yes, the film has the required blackguards, but none of them strike us as particularly crooked and corrupt, clothed as they are in impeccable suits and polished shoes.  Or maybe that is the point; they are just ordinary people like you and I, albeit of a different class.  They are people doing a job, like all of us, I guess.  From a cinematic viewpoint, this makes them prosaic and lifeless.  They remain props, whose role is to fill the frame and nothing else.  The film’s opening sequence is well shot with clever use of editing and sound mixing, but sadly this is not sustained thereafter.  The plot unravels as the director jumps from one scenic European location to another and we understand that some kind of global conspiracy is in motion.  Clive Owen and Naomi Watts then appear.  This heterosexual pairing is quite insipid, no chemistry, no bonding, no nothing between them, possibly again, because they are just “ordinary” people doing a job.  Well whatever the reason, thirty minutes into the movie, and one is trying to keep ennui at bay.  The only consolations are the locations, which look as if they are just what the James Bond franchise ordered.  In the first half the plot starts to get complicated, but the film manages reasonably well.  It is in the second half that it flounders. 
Tom Tykwer is the chap who helmed Run Lola Run and also Perfume.  He is known for his breakneck editing and flashy style, but this film has none of it.  There is just one magnificent action sequence set in the Guggenheim museum, which one licks one’s chops over.  But it is a classic case of too little, too late.  The rest of the film remains sluggish and produces in the viewer an extreme apathy.  Clive Owen looks dazed and confused, Naomi Watts is inanimate throughout, and the rest of the characters flit in and out.  The director was possibly trying to bridge the gap between a social comment and an action thriller, and it looks like he really could not make up his mind.  At one point, the film looks set to take off into hard core action - Hollywood style, but that does not happen.  Instead it just fizzles off into befuddled stupidity.  To make it worse, most of the dialogues at important moments seem to consist only of platitudes.  One feels depressed at the pointlessness of it all: the director has talent, he had a topical premise to work with, but the end result is strictly ho-hum.

495,1195,1195,1195,1195,The Iron Lady,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/iron-lady-review/,,5/5.0,,4.466666667,"The Iron Lady stands more as a celebration of Meryl Streep, arguably one of the finest actors we have today. She acts with her eyes, whether she plays an old woman distraught with dementia, or a powerful, long-standing politician. As a biopic, however, the film falls flat without a tone or a message. It’s a mere play of facts with no binding thread. Watch the film for Streep alone. ","Ever since I saw the trailer of The Iron Lady, I couldn’t imagine anyone else but Meryl Streep play Margaret Thatcher. In my head, with whatever little knowledge I had about the politician, I thought it was brilliant casting, to get someone as able as Streep to play an ambivalent character as hers. This thought stayed with me after I walked out of watching the film. I struggled to place Thatcher’s real face. All I could think of, was this one shot of Streep as Thatcher with her husband Denis Thatcher (played by Jim Broadbent), as they stand behind a podium, dressed in blue, with their hands held up together in victory. Streep sold me the visual picture. Using flashbacks as its main narrative device, The Iron Lady traces Thatcher’s journey from an unknown British woman who went to oxford, and slowly, through the course of her marriage and twins, finds her way into politics. We whisk through her accomplishments, through a series of montages. We also periodically keep intercutting to the present day, where we see an older Thatcher, battling with dementia, as she has make-believe conversations. We are shown flashbacks of her courtship days with her husband, and archival footage of the British political past. It’s a slow progression however; one that not necessarily follows a particular motif.The biggest problem with The Iron Lady is the absence of direction of the script. The film attempts to capture all of Thatcher’s life in 2 hours, but as is the case with every biopic, a flavour is necessary; or what is popularly known as a peg. We are shown her involvements in major historical events (A war in Argentina, her invasion of the Falkland Islands, etc). But it goes wrong in its flat, lifeless portrayal. The graph of her political career would have been more interesting had we been shown the impact of her professional accomplishments on her psyche, her loved and mostly on her rivals. No other character has been paid attention to, while Streep gives the performance of the year. While Jim Broadbent as Dennis Thatcher is gripping, Streep is the clear show-stealer. She takes on the voice, accent, demeanor, and powerful-eyes of Thatcher – this film has nothing else going for itself. She captures the confusion and nuances of a person suffering from dementia perfectly, and you’re able to sit up in awe when this is intercut with glimpses of her longstanding political career.The Iron Lady would have been a much more impactful film has the script managed to hold our interest. Instead, we end up getting confused about the tone of the film, and the message it wants to convey. It is merely a document of dull facts being played out one after another, and the use of flashbacks have not been justified. Was the Oscar worth it, is a question that this film cannot answer. Streep has given a powerful performance, but because the film doesn’t bind it together – I personally prefer her in The Devil Wears Prada. Watch The Iron Lady for Meryl Streep alone, though if you miss this one, you won’t really be missing anything.

496,1196,1196,1196,1196,The Jungle Book,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review25 Critic Reviews 4.8/5.0 9 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/jungle-book-review/,4.8/5.0,5/5.0,,4.9,Become a child. Take your kid(s) along.,"From the first frame you are taken deep into the jungle where a pack of wolves and a panther are training a man-child to be as much like a wolf as he can be. The pace doesn't drop and neither does the quality of the 3D. What makes it even better is that the story keeps you with it even though you've known the outcome for years. Very rarely do you see grim color schemes in animation films. Even though the situation is gloomy and characters are in mortal danger, animation films usually have a chirpy set of colors to make the danger seem far away. Jungle Book breaks this norm and you see lots of grays and browns. In fact, the end sequence is set completely in the night. And no this is not because of the usual bad projection usually associated with 3D. I can't say it makes things look real, but I can say it makes things as real as animation set in fantasy can get! The sprinting deer, the long, dry grass, the fruits hanging off trees transport you to the middle of the action. Of course, there are logical glitches like any fantasy would have, “How would Mowgli know to use his 'tricks'?”. You explain it away, “He is human, he is smart.” “How do the animals know water can put out a fire?” You shrug, “it is fantasy”, you explain away. A certain emotional connect is lacking too but the nuances in the animation more than make up for it. In fact, it always amazes me about well-done animation – the facial expressions, the body language far surpasses many a live action film. This is also after considering that we do give an unsaid discount to animation. If you thought Mowgli and you were deep in the woods at the beginning of the film, you will discover the density of the jungle only better as the movie moves along. The dense forest, the scenes with Kaa and King Louie are just plain and simple mind-boggling. Once the animation is under the movie's belt, the voice enacting and Neel Sethi's (Mowgli) performance are just perfect. You root for Mowgli and not only because we are his people. Bhaloo's good-natured manipulation makes you laugh and King Louie is as adorable as he is meant to be menacing. Sher Khan has a streak of wanting the good under his meanness. Characters made interesting by they own shades of black and white.The film flows along smoothly from one scene to another. But, in some of the fast-paced chase sequences, a few edits – a fall from one rock to another; a swing from one branch to another - are rather badly done. Yes, yes, they are few and far between; and they pass by too quickly to leave a mark.The Jungle Book enthralls with its technical expertise and with its story-telling too. One of those films that takes you back to your childhood and becomes a lovely memory for today's children.ps. I saw it in English.

Mammootty and Suresh Gopi rarely put a foot wrong in this otherwise tedious and tiresome film. While fans would probably find it worth a watch just for the ferocity with which the superstars essay their roles, this is not exactly the kind of film I would recommend to those new to cinema of the South.","The King & The Commissioner is a hard film to critique. While there is very little in the film worthy of a mention, almost of all of its flaws are pounded to a pulp by its two superstar leads – Mammootty and Suresh Gopi. But then let’s face it – that is pretty much what they do best – pound things to a pulp, with punches or with punch lines.The pair reprise earlier hit characters from separate films of theirs, only this time, they are brought together in the interest of the nation (and the producers of the film, no doubt.) Still brash, still arrogant and still stylish, Mammootty’s Joseph Alex is now a top bureaucrat. He has been put on a special mission by the Prime Minister of India (played by our very own Mohan Agashe) and is to be aided in his cause by none other than Bharathchandran, played by Suresh Gopi – now on ‘Special Assignment’ and yes, still brash, still arrogant and if possible, even more stylish.There is absolutely no denying that nearly everything is wrong with this film. Right from the opening reels of the film where Pakistanis with Malayali accents reveal their goal of terrorizing India, the film’s treatment and screenplay is all over the place. It is one of those bits of writing where it seems like a lot is happening, when very little is - too many caricature-ish characters, too much talk, but very little meat. Sinfully long at nearly three-and-a-quarter hours, it can be an extremely exhausting film to watch. Far too verbose for its own good, its woes are compounded with a host of unnecessary scenes and subplots that pepper proceedings right till the very end. The film should ideally (and could easily) have been about two hours long. The other big problem with the film is the technical aspect. Insanely over-shot and over-cut, this is the kind of film whose shot breakdown I’d die to get my hands on and whose editor I’d love to have a private chat with. It would be extremely enlightening to know exactly how he came up with the idea for those umpteen cuts where the screen is split into ways that would make a butcher feel terribly low about himself.Far more serious is the way in which names have been taken in this film. Pakistan is clearly the villain, with no attempt at being mellow towards them for the sake of diplomacy in the real world. If the promos of Agent Vinod got them riled up enough to ban it, this film could severely hamper Indo-Pak ties for good if they ever happened to chance upon it. Not to mention some vicious attacks on a few public figures who’ve been in the news in the recent past. This film has clearly been made to play to the galleries, which is a pity. The makers had two megastars who would have set the cash registers jingling in any case. They could have used this golden opportunity to make a film that was topical, relevant and engaging without resorting to needless sensationalism.But then, when the two stars are on screen, really, all else pales. The two are clearly in their zones in this film. They thunderously deliver the over-the-top lines with ease, often making you forget how unnecessary the lines actually were in the first place. Yes, both well past 50 and both have paunches.  The remarkable thing however is that they don’t look ungainly in action sequences at all. Suresh Gopi, in particular, looks extremely at ease decimating a dozen baddies without breaking a sweat. The two of them also have the phenomenal ability to make others in the frame look good, no matter how silly they otherwise are. Their presence radiates and enhances people around them, even if the people are mediocre by themselves. Nothing, really, can take away from the fact that these two fine National Award-winning actors are as much at ease playing these over-the-top commercial characters as they are playing real characters in sensible and sensitive stories.The King & The Commissioner as a film is a lot like some of the action scenes in it – two towering personalities standing in a sea of mediocrity. It is the kind of film that I would recommend only to those who would not need any recommendation to watch it at all – they would have watched it any way. For others, particularly for those who like to believe that they are above all the shenanigans that big stars in big films indulge in, I’d recommend settling in with a nice, quiet book instead.

498,1198,1198,1198,1198,The King's Speech,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review3 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/kings-speech-review/,,4/5.0,,4.566666667,"Watching The King’s Speech is like watching the gentleman’s game at Lord’s. It’s quintessentially British - every nip and tuck deserving of applause - carefully fleshed out to result into a genuinely feel good film about a King’s bond with a commoner to overcome his speech impediment. Brilliant performances by Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush, and a screenplay by the very gifted David Steidler, this film pleased the Oscar jury like none other. You may rush to the theatres to watch it while it’s still playing, and put a fashionable Facebook update :)","You know those lists newspapers recommend during Teacher’s Day? ‘Films based on the role of teachers’, etc., where they will mention films such as To Sir With Love, Black, Karate Kid, etc. Well, add a new film to that list - em>The King’s Speech. It’s a heartwarming, feel-good movie about a king resorting to an ordinary man’s help to overcome a speech disability, so that he can deliver an important speech to his countrymen.It’s what I call the ‘pure gentleman’s film’, steeped in British royalty, since it concerns the Duke of York (Colin Firth in an Oscar winning performance) and Queen Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter, the most gentle, kind and determined wife). Right from the background score, to the sets, to the wry humor about knighthood, to the psychological divide between the royalty and the masses - it is the most typically British film, I’ve seen in recent times. (The Queen was the last gem, that comes to mind.)The film works because of its performances, witty writing and the character improvisations. Colin Firth is outstanding, as is his speech therapist, Lionel (played by Geoffrey Rush). On paper, Lionel’s character is certainly far more interesting and this is established in scenes where the screenplay allows him to stand his ground and treat the Duke as a student / patient, than as royalty with whom he needs to watch his manners.Writer David Seidler uses Lionel not only to transform the Duke into a deserving King who can speak his mind, but also to make subtle commentary about the ridiculous customs of the monarchy, its values which have now outstayed their welcome in the 21st Century. The most remarkable quality about his writing is that despite being based on a true story during the World War, Lionel’s approach at dealing with the royalty seems extremely contemporary, rooted in the current times.A special word about cinematographer Danny Cohen’s characteristic wide angles used consistently throughout the film. And that special word is, marvellous. It’s spectacular how the camerawork adapts to the Duke’s speech correction - at the beginning, the wide angles almost bloat up his head every time he is facing the camera, a sign that he is losing his mind, in frustration of his stammering habit exposed to the public. As he embraces Lionel’s controversial methods of treatment, the wide angles slowly disappear and you begin to see a King, chin up.It is Colin Firth’s film, throughout. He is as convincing as a cat that has caught its tongue, and his transition from an embarrassed, nervous wreck, to a man who forges a bond with Lionel and becomes worthy of ownership of his throne, is classic. Mid-way through the film, I thanked my stars (and my tongue) because the realisation dawned that speech, oratory skills and language have been at the core of the greatest resistances and revolutions in history. And they continue to do so.The King’s Speech is undoubtedly a great film, but I do not think it is something you HAVE to watch on the big screen. I usually prefer films that do not require me to pause crunching my popcorn, just so that I have to hear the dialogue clearly. A deserving big screen watch is a film with some element of action, music, adventure or fantasy, that makes the experience immersive. The King’s Speech, largely filmed indoors, doesn’t present any of those attributes - and therefore, in my view, does not command compulsive viewing in theatres, especially not in near-empty ones its playing at, in the on-going World Cup season. I suspect the original DVD may release soon - banking on the Oscar acclaim - and you could have a far more holistic experience, rounding it up with the behind the scenes and how-did-you-pull-it-off interviews with Colin Firth.But before I conclude, I must address a crucial question: Did this film deserve the epitome of Oscar glory this year? My answer is a firm no. Not because it is not a good film - it raises many a chuckle, mostly tongue-in-cheek, but never a WOW.  The Social Network, Inception, Black Swan are some films that do make us go WOW, and on many occasions even make us cringe in our seats, shield our eyes and most importantly, forget that there’s popcorn and Coke on the armrest. That’s immersive, in the true sense.

Is it a movie? Whatever it is, it's a collage of brilliant performances. If only story had some clear direction!","I'm sure at most times, our mind works in moments, switching threads with or without connection, fluttering around various compartments of our lives. The Last Lear appears to be a peek into the writer's thoughts. We get glimpses playing out one after the other. Only, these glimpses are enacted by the most talented set of performers we have. What is it about? Broken trust? Guilt? An inside look at the passion a man feels for his art? Manipulation another equally passionate artist is capable of? The lives of three women and how one incident has marked their lives? A comment on how working women are treated by their men irrespective of the economic strata they come from? To bring about the difference between plays and cinema? A little bit of each, a whole lot of ultimately nothing. Now, whether this aimlessness is a result of Utpal Dutt's writing or because of the way it is adapted for screen by Rituparno Ghosh and Co. - I don't know. What I do know is it comes across as meandering all over the place. And the only undertones I can interpret are way too contrived to even mention here.The word 'realisitic cinema' is mentioned in the movie. True the characters and their situaions seem real. But there's one thing I don't understand about so-called 'realistic cinema'. Granted, they save us from the bright, eye-torturing color saturation. But does painting it all jaundiced yellow make it any more real? The nicotine tinge wouldn't have bothered me that much if any of the relationships were given apt attention. Also most of the Shakespeare verses sounded more mysterious than meaningful. And since I couldn't decipher the mystery, I sure hope that they were used in context with what was going on in the story at that point.Maybe the parallel narration could be blamed for adding to the patch-work feel. But, I liked how we know Harish Mishra (Amitabh Bachchan) bit-by-bit, sewn together by memories of various people who knew him and the warmth each one feels for him. But that's the narrative style; the character itself is more-or-less one-dimensional. Similarly we know very superficially, what the other characters are going through on that particular day. Shabnam (Priety Zinta) is confident yet vulnerable. Vandana (Shefaly Shah) masks her tender devotion with an arrogant poise. Just because Ivy (Divya Dutta) doesn't react doesn't mean she's dumb or heartless. Yet, I feel cheated, deprived from knowing them more, knowing them better.Despite this, the actors perform with such passion. And this is not just for Amitabh Bachchan. Priety, Shefali, and Divya are so convincing that for me the movie is more about their characters than Harish's. This is certainly the most I've seen Arjun Rampal's facial muscles move - he can actually do it! What a shame that it has taken so long!?Sir Bachchan - what do I say? That his performance was eloquent, his voice modulation articulate, his body language mesmerizing, his diction immaculate, his talent...? Such shallow words they are. Overacting? Maybe - in an off scene here or there. But, I was in awe, rubbing my arms to get rid of the goose bumps during his audition for the director. This in spite of the so unnecessary and out-of-place melodramatic lighting and camerawork. My favorite moments were those when he switched from Harish to a Shakespearean character and back in what looked like single takes.  'Moment' - that's the key word throughout. As Harish mentions, ""you never know when 'the moment' will come"". And you see them trying hard to create that perfect moment. But so engrossed are they in doing that, that the motivations of the characters and the movie remain blurry.

To release The Lion King in 3D is technological irony but it proves to be a decent effort, culminating the wholesome visual experience of 3D with a classic animated film. Watch the grander version of The Lion King if you’ve been a fan of the film, and run to theatres if you haven’t seen the film before! ","The guy who sells 3D glasses at the ticket counter must be thanking his stars right now. Every Friday a new film is added to his list of 3D films – the demand is increasing. To him, it doesn’t matter that most films are not shot in 3D, hence they end up with projection problems, dim viewing due to the tint of the glasses, and not to mention a headache that most walk out with. When news of The Lion King being released in 3D came around, there was panic. The original film released in 1994, uses traditional hand-drawn animation, which is 2D is nature. There was my childhood; virtually every moral lesson I imbibed, being re-released in 3D. Anybody would panic. But I had to watch it, it was a compulsive need – to compare and rant and crib about what the world had come to, in the name of commercialization (which is a bit hypocritical, I realized, because I owned every merchandise of the Lion King that existed.)Viewing the movie, however, makes you forget all of that. The epic sense of the film comes thoroughly, with the 3 D version (provided the projection is up to mark) and because it offers a new dimension to viewing the film, the re-release works. However, the experience is only mildly different; if you’re a fan of things flying at you and the sense of grandeur that you would inevitably get with the 3D effect then, the 3D version will  give you your money’s worth.  The Lion Kingis set in an anthropomorphic jungle in Africa called Pride Rock – where the royal family headed by King Mufasa is loved and respected by all. Life in the jungle is dutiful and simple and the movie begins with the birth of Mufasa’s son Simba. The family’s rival, Scar (also Mufasa’s brother) is constantly trying to overpower him to become the king. The film traces their story – of love, betrayal and honour.For those of you who have already watched the film many times over, the same points will make you cry, Scar and the hyenas will still manage to scare you, Simba and Nala’s growing love over Elton John’s classic ‘Can You Feel The Love Tonight’ will still make you smile with fondness and you will still feel a void when you walk out of the movies – at the end of the 2 most precious hours of nostalgia.Funnily enough, the voice-overs of side characters include familiar names like Rowan Atkinson (voice of Zazu, Mufasa’s right hand) and Whoopi Goldberg (voice of the female hyena in Scar’s army) and the background score is given by Hans Zimmer. Elton John and Time Rice have written and composed 5 songs in films – all of which have been re-touched and performed countless times at Broadway and live concerts. It would take you an entire day to listen to the various versions of the songs.For many (including me)The Lion King being released in 3D was essentially a revisit to our childhood - of days when Disney was about 2D animation and classic cartoons, and a time when we hadn’t heard of Hanna Montana or The High School Musical trilogy. Re-releasing the film in 3D, undoubtedly gives you that added advantage of watching the film on the big screen with effects and wholesome viewing experience. Otherwise, The Lion Kingin 3D includes your favorite moments, your favorite characters and another excuse to watch your favorite film, regardless of the visual dimension

With a creepy background score and inventive dialogues, writer-director Billy Wilder evocatively captures the helplessness of a struggling writer who cannot help but be lured to the depths of addiction before he begins penning his novel.","Story-tellers have often been fascinated with the depths a man plunges to under the influence of alcohol. If you can think deep about how addiction affects creativity, career, love, family, society and you've got fodder for a plot,  it's good enough to be woven into a screenplay. From India, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's  Devdas , was spun into various versions on screen. In the West, one of the earliest films made on this theme, is Billy Wilder'sThe Lost Weekend.Filmed in 1945, after Wilder chanced upon a novel by the same name on a railway journey to Hollywood, The Lost Weekend, a story about four days in the life of a chronic alcoholic, is possibly one of his best written films. I say so, because there have been few films that have articulated the effects of alcohol on the human mind, the desperation that follows, when one drink is too much and yet, even a hundred more are not enough. That’s exactly the dilemma of the film's protagonist Don Birnam (Ray Milland, in an Oscar winning performance), a struggling writer who after being hailed as Hemingway as a 19-year old in college, is 33 now and cannot put pen to paper, because his mind is always asking him ""to have a drink first"".Wilder makes Birnam express his desperation, frustration and helplessness through memorable lines and while doing so, provides a great commentary about an alcoholic's obnoxious nature in society and his obsession with getting his next fix. The gravity of Birnam's situation is expressed through fantastic close-ups. In a scene where Birnam is settling down for a drink, he is shown removing his coat and sitting on the sofa - Wilder almost equates Birnam's relationship with alcohol as sexual in nature. There are also scenes where he uses characters to illustrate society's condemnation and lack of hope about the writing profession, something which adds to Birnam's woes and makes him drown his sorrows even more, in alcohol. What amazes is how little time the screenplay takes in establishing Birnam's condition. As the film progresses through a linear narrative, interspersed with flashbacks, Wilder guides the viewer scene by scene, to what depths Birnam has fallen, to get his liquor. He also uses satire with good effect - a rehab centre is named 'Hangover Plaza' and some regulars there are former advertising professionals! A special mention about the terrific background score - a classic trademark in all Billy Wilder films - which gives the film an eerie feel, unheard of, in a genre like this. Some scenes are frightening, especially the hospital scene towards the end, which has me squirming, every time I watch it. Wilder uses lights, doors, sounds and Birnam's close-ups to great effect. In my view, the biggest reason why the story of The Lost Weekend is a classic, is that 65 years later, mankind is still battling with addiction, rehab centres haven’t changed their treatment measures and the expression on the face of a man desperate for his next glass of liquor, is still the same. Bravo, Mr Wilder.

What is companionship? What is attraction?","After a certain stage in a relationship, most likely, there is comfort or stagnancy. In either case, you need an extra spark, something to look forward to. The apprehension; the spring in the step; the glint in the eye that a new relationship brings - that's what The Lunchbox is about. And more. Like any other relationship, Ila-Fernandes relationship is as much about the two individuals as it is about the relationship itself. Sure, the chemistry builds up beautifully, without one setting an eye on the other. But, their personal insecurities, frustrations is what makes The Lunchbox stand apart from most other films.Moreover, the whole package is breathtakingly simple. The one-line plot, the characters, the ambiance, the situations, the humor would make even the most city-bred in the audience believe that a middle-class world like this exists, as much as it ever did, even today. The one-liner ""what if"" - what if the well-known lunchbox system went wrong one day and put two lonely souls in touch with each other? How fascinating an idea! Of the thousands of possibilities, the one writer/director Ritesh Batra picks is as charmingly old-school as it gets. The characters he picks to put together are mere faces in the crowd of 20 million. Ordinary, uninteresting - most likely, you and me. The side characters, including the neighbor oldie (Bharti Achrekar) you don't see, are given quirks that are thoroughly enjoyable, even if not real. You don't root for any of the characters, you just play along and are willing to go wherever the story takes you. There is no arc. There is no significant peak in the story. The simple progress of conversations between Ila and Fernandez is enough to keep you going. Each one is special; just like each conversation of a budding relationship is dear. Yet, none of it, not a thing would've been acceptable if it weren't for Irrfan Khan and Nimrat Kaur. Let alone the slightest show of spark or disappointment in their eyes, the variation in the tone for their voice-overs is enough to inspire awe. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is a charmer as always. The most obvious character in the film is one I am biased towards - Mumbai. Any film that reminds me of the sights, the smells, the energy of that city has won me over in the first scene. In complete contrast to this buzzing city is, ever so slow-paced, The Lunchbox. A beautiful contrast which could get to you if you are waiting for something to happen. So, depending on your make and what you seek in your films, the climax can be exhilarating or underwhelming. I was bang in between, even though I cannot see a more fitting end to the film. That's what will make or break the film for you.

At several points during The Machinist, you will promise yourself never to deliberately stay up and let your demons take over. Christian Bale’s underweight, sleep-deprived look is so disturbing, it compels you to sit through the movie to figure out what happens. Watch the film for a good old dose of wide-eyes-shock-revelation-relief. ","It’s scary when you’ve seen a fit and bordering-chubby actor in films like American Psychoand Nolan’s BatmanSeries turn into a frail, 6’3 - 110 pounds man for a character. Apart from the sincerity and dedication, Christian Bale’s look in The Machinistjust creeps you out. In the film, he plays a man who hasn’t slept in a year and hence loses copious amounts of weight, and everytime you see his ribcage or protruding spine you just want to leap into the screen, feed him some food and sing him a lullaby to sleep. The Machinistis a thriller alright. Trevor Reznik works as a machinist, a fairly laborious job which should want him to have a good night’s sleep. Yet his insomnia brings him to a nightmarish state, where he repeatedly has flashback visions, everything around him is woozy and uncontrollable. He believes a co-worker who doesn’t exist is harassing him, he gets sucked into a warped game of hangman, which haunts him at several points, and he finds solace in 2 women with dual personalities - a sex-worker who becomes his confidante and a dedicated mother and a waitress, who allows him to escape his world through their conversations. Both women overlap each other, yet they stand apart bringing to the table different emotions for him to explore. The concoctions used in The Machinistare the standard ones. A troubled protagonist, undergoing physical and psychological trauma that leads to furthering of the plot, a dark, largely black/white tone of the film and an ascending Hitchcock-esque wailing piano background music. You know his lack of sleep is making Reznik see things, yet you want to know if someone is conspiring against him, as he believes. You will find yourself arguing that all of this could be a hallucination, but you don’t want to seem presumptuous – hence you sit with your bitten nails waiting to see what finally happens. Although no ground-breaking secrets are revealed at the end of the film – it’s actually a very typical climax for it’s genre - you still make that journey as a viewer with the film where you feel like the story has met it’s end. You know because Reznik has found his closure, you can sit back and feel the same. The Machinistis one of those few films where you get attached to character not because you particularly like him, or because you are sympathetic of him – it’s just a brilliant job of characterization. You immediately feel drawn to his story.The DVD has an audio commentary from the director Brad Anderson, which helps deconstruct the film and is much better than having a rambling account of the shoot and set. The only problem is, he spoils the endings of films like Fight Club andThe Sixth Sense, so if you haven’t seen those, skip the commentary. There are also a few deleted scenes and theatrical trailers in the special features section, which is intriguing – they reveal that the film is shot in Spain. Bale’s look in the film would qualify as the creepiest aspect, among other things in the film. You’d be interested in knowing that 3 months after the shoot of this film, he shot for Batman Begins. The Machinistis out and out a Christian Bale film; it’s about his character, his look and the creepy stuff that happens to you if you don’t sleep. Take your mother’s advice, go to sleep before someone makes a movie about your insomnia.

","Easily the most poetic and haunting film I’ve watched on the big screen in a long time, (Anand Gandhi’s Ship of Theseus comes a close second,) Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master is an extraordinarily melancholic and layered film that seems to be about so many things, and then again about nothing at all, all at once. But with this film, Paul Thomas Anderson once again underlines the fact that he is one of the most daringly original thinkers that American cinema has produced, ever.Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix, terrific in his return) is a broken man, a World War II seaman trying to deal with life in a post-war world. He is sexually frustrated, almost always high on booze (that he makes himself using commonplace ingredients that he finds at hand), and is perhaps looking for direction in his life. He seems to find this direction in the words and teachings of Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman, beautifully nuanced), the founder of a philosophical stream of thought known as ‘The Cause’. The core of the film is the mysterious relationship between the two polar opposites that Freddie and Dodd (called ‘Master’ by his followers) represent. Freddie is wayward, eccentric, filled with nervous energy that is constantly looking for an outlet, or better yet, a form of control. Dodd, on the other hand, seems always in control for the most. Freddie is, in many ways, looking for meaning in his life, something to bow down to, like a master. Dodd provides that to some extent, but there always seems to be something missing, something that you can’t quite place. As the film strips away and lays bare before you the characters of Freddie and Dodd, it also hides so much more than it shows, inviting you deeper into it, to draw meaning. Like how some of Freddie’s actions often draw smirks or even laughs, but if you pause to think about it, the weight of loneliness and frustrations behind his actions should, if anything, make one cry. Of course, pre-release, one of the film’s most talked-about aspects was the fact that the character of Lancaster Dodd is based Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. The parallels between The Cause and Scientology are very clear; Anderson makes no attempt to mask it. So be it the past-life regression and the healing powers that Dodd attributes to it, the belief that man can cure his ailments in his current life by delving into his previous lives and curing him there, albeit mentally – all these and many more are all there. However, anyone expecting to find out the mystery behind what makes so many millions around the world follow Scientology as a religion is bound to be disappointed. Joaquin Phoenix’s performance as Freddie is one of the most gut-wrenching portrayals of a character in recent times. Perhaps Daniel Day Lewis did deserve his Best Actor Oscar for his performance as Lincoln, but some may say that the man had the added benefit of prosthetics as well as historical reference points to help him ‘feel’ more like the 16th President of the United State. But Joaquin Phoenix inhabits Freddie with the kind of body language and state of mind that had no reference point, and for that alone, he must be lauded. Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as Lancaster Dodd. A Paul Thomas Anderson staple, his filmography with Anderson alone shows the remarkable range that Hoffman has. It is tough to even imagine that the same guy who played Scotty in Boogie Nights has played Lancaster Dodd in The Master.Mihai Mălaimare Jr’s gorgeous cinematography and Johnny Greenwood’s sparsely arranged but no-less haunting music embellish the sense of loneliness and the endless hunt for meaning that the film essentially is. Also, what a pity that we don’t get a 70mm release for the film in India. The kind of detail that every 70mm frame would hold would perhaps give a little more insight into what Anderson is trying to say in every shot. Paul Thomas Anderson is an absolute master at taking the basest of human characteristics and weaving near-epic films out of them. He is also particularly skilled in making a film feel like it is lighter – so to speak – than it actually is. But with The Master, he goes more esoteric than he has ever done before; it asks more from a viewer than most viewers are used to giving to a film. Though many will disagree, I have long held the view that truly great cinema can only be appreciated on repeated viewings. Anyone who calls, for example, The Godfather, or Pulp Fiction, great films after watching them once has absolutely no idea why these films are great; they have to be watched repeatedly to see what true cinematic greatness is. Which is why The Master is the kind of film that will have polarized opinions. There will either be those who will reject the film in the first viewing, not wondering what the big deal is about, or there will be those who will feel like continuously revisiting it, attempting to draw more meaning with each subsequent viewing, then reading up on it and watching it again. They will continuously question themselves on what Dodd’s intentions were, when it came to Freddy. Or when, exactly, did Dodd and Freddie first meet? Or was that a hint of homoeroticism they spotted in the relationship between Dodd and Freddie? Or what are Dodd’s exact intentions with The Cause itself? And what, really, does the film even mean? If you are looking for it, the film always gives you the feeling that you’ve missed something. Likely then, that if you ask Anderson himself just what the film is about, he’ll probably only say, “Secrets.”

The WWII setting and ensemble cast can't save the film from being the disappointment that it is.","The most audacious stories are often found in real life; and when these stories are adapted for the screen in the right manner, they usually have what it takes to enthral viewers. Ben Affleck's Argo, for instance, was the perfect example of how a real life tale can be adapted to make a thrilling film.A cursory glance at George Clooney's latest, The Monuments Men, can make one feel that the film has precisely what it takes to deliver what Argo did - a hooking World War 2 based premise and a cast that has the chops to pull it off in style. Think about it - an unlikely bunch of non-soldiers are brought together and sent in to World War II Europe to retrieve valuable pieces of art that were stolen by Hitler's regime, on his orders. Picassos and Rembrandts and Michelangelos; artworks that are like the markers of humankind's cultural progress; art that, if lost, would be like a loss of a fragment of humankind itself.Yet, at least in cinema, there is but a thin line between subtlety and exaggeration; and in choosing the former, Clooney ends up making a staid film that is underwhelming at best.Of course, it was rather brave of Clooney to choose the understated manner in which he chose to narrate a story that had enough in it to become a thrill-a-minute heist film. Hollywood studios aren't particularly known to favour the kind of narrative style he has chosen. The film has its heart in the right place, but ends up becoming a victim of its own manner. The question, really, is how subtle is 'too subtle'.The film doesn't particularly have a graph; you expect it to rise and rise as it progresses, but it never does. You expect it to lead you to an exciting finale, only to leave you disappointed. Laced with a few genuine smile-worthy moments and with a large amount of respect for the masters of art, the film focuses more on instilling an awareness about just how important our art is, in the overall story of humanity.Despite taking us through familiar people and places - at least from history textbooks, if nothing else, the film fails to truly engage and connect. In fact, the film is set in the fag end of WWII, when Germany had begin to withdraw a lot of their European occupation. The stellar cast - Clooney himself, Matt Damon, Jean Dujardin, John Goodman, Bob Balaban, Bill Murray and Cate Blanchett, amongst others, do a great job - precisely what was expected of them. However, the film jumps between their stories too often, which concurrently means that no particular character stays with you once the film is over.As director, Clooney is certainly maturing with time. He easily seems more in control than he did in The Ides of March, for instance. As I mentioned earlier, the route he chose to narrate this particular story is a brave one; a world away from the one chosen by Affleck in Argo. One wonders though, whether it is that which proves to be the film's biggest undoing. Including the audience and evoking a response only in rare spurts, The Monuments Men is mostly just bland.

Generous on clichés and borrowed settings and tropes, the only real redeeming quality of the film is that it ends.","The biggest fallout of something terribly mediocre doing well is that it spawns a whole generation of mediocrity based on the same theme, with the aim of cashing in on the mania. The Twilight franchise, then, is the torchbearer for teen romances dolled up with monsters and/or fantastical adventure settings. So Twilight led to another franchise Hunger Games (which, I must admit, was guilty fun) of which the second film is on its way, and the recent other Stephenie Meyer adaptation, The Host. The latest to follow this trend is The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones – the first film adaptation from a set of books by Cassandra Clare. So exhaustingly inane and utterly ridiculous is the film that when I walked out, I couldn’t believe I had only been in there for only a little over two hours. Now, I’m scared of just how many books are left in the series. This first film hasn’t even had time enough to gather all of its brickbats, but the sequel is already underway.Clary is a typical teenager with typical teenage problems – or so she thinks. Clary and her geeky best friend Simon get drawn into a world of werewolves and vampires and magical portals; a world where even Bach was supposedly a Shadowhunter and wrote music that could tell a demon apart by its reaction to it – no, I’m not making this up. Packed with so much exposition, explanation, back-story and mythology, but with clichés that rival all of this in equal measure - the film is such a cumbersome watch. It just never eases up on the levels of idiocy it so inevitably keeps crossing. I haven’t read the source material, so I don’t know; but it seems like a lot of this has more to do with the direction than with the original novel. Harald Zwart, director of Agent Cody Banks and Jaden Smith’s The Karate Kid, directs this film with what seems like alarming intent to ensure that it never separates itself from the other typical teen movies I mentioned earlier. This is the kind of film where it begins raining indoors in the middle of a kiss. It is, of course, conveniently attributed to something else later, but the point was clearly the kiss in the rain. The film also keeps giving you a Harry Potter-Constantine déjà vu, which isn’t necessarily a good thing. Apart from never being able to shake off the been-there-seen-that feel, the film just doesn’t seem to have an original word in its screenplay. The film does have some interestingly executed VFX pieces, but that’s just the opposite of me nitpicking – I was left determinedly hunting for anything at all to take away from the film. With its generous display of hooded or skeleton-shaped gargoyles and statues and a camera that continuously seems to want to establish setting with every new scene, the film tries hard to create a sense of foreboding and danger - which I admit does happen once in a while. However, anything good achieved comes undone with the next familiar fantasy-teen-romance-trope or next annoying back-story-exposition that the film takes you through.It doesn’t help that the performances in the film are as mundane as can be. Even the known faces, Lena Headey and Jonathan Rhys Meyers amongst others, are left with roles that often make you wonder how they kept a straight face through it. The young trio who are left with the task of carrying the film give it their all, but there’s only so much one can do when everything else around is how it is in this film. The film is just so draining and wearisome, that every time you spot the Mortal Cup that everyone’s running after, you wish you had some strong wine to go with; downing a cup would make this film infinitely more tolerable.

510,1210,1210,1210,1210,The Murder of Roger Ackroyd,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review3 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/murder-roger-ackroyd-review/,,5/5.0,,4.866666667,"There are very few detective novels that ensure you vividly remember the endings. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is one such novel, which will never let you forget the narrative if you manage to read the book.  The movie adaptation is detailed, earnest, classy and a nail-bitter, all the ingredients needed to be successful detective film. Ultimately, the book is a much more interesting experience than the movie, but don’t make the mistake of missing the DVD which is one of the most genuine adaptations I’ve seen, managing to retain the complex flavours of the book. ","Over the years, and multiple adaptations later, I have always found myself on the side of books in the book versus film debate. This holds true especially for the Harry Potter Series, The Lord of the Ring Series and the Dan Brown books. However, British detective fiction adaptations are slightly different. The Bond movies are a separate entity from the books – with the suave style and dramatization of the character of Bond, and the picturesque visuals that the movies incorporate. Which is why a debate surrounding a DVD series of Christie’s The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd seemed like it would transgress mere extremes. BBC in collaboration with Carnival Films and ITV have been dramatizing Agatha Christie’s Poirot series since 1989, but if there is one DVD that a Christie reader should want to pick up it would be The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd. The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd deals with a series of murders in the quite English countryside, King’s Abbot, where Poirot had decided to retire. It starts with the murder of a wealthy businessman Ashley Ferrers, followed by the suicide of his wife, Dorothy Ferrers and then finally, her lover Roger Ackroyd, whose murder seems to be most peculiar. Poirot finds that the people around the victims are hiding much about their lives, and this forces him out of his retirement.The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd  has a romantic, serene picture and an old world charm to it – much like the language that the book uses. Christopher Gunning uses the violins as background music as a perfect blend to the calm flow and appeal of the narrative, but halfway through the movie you are slapped with an increasing pace of anxiousness. The movie carefully carves out that build up, which makes the film an interesting piece of detective fiction in isolation. A book like The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is multifaceted, deceptive and experimental – yet if one were to adapt it to a movie, there is only one-way to do it. The film has taken that route of transforming a 2-dimensional convoluted narrative, which determines the literary complexities of the structure into an easily narrated film. Poirot plays the part of merely a detective in the book, but in the film he becomes the central narrator. After watching one film, you want to go buy all the movies in the series, because you are left curious about the intricacies of the adaptations, and that is why this DVD series is such a delight – almost like a double treat. A near perfect adaptation of one of Christie’s most complicated novels and a detailed, classy who-dun-nit for those of you who haven’t read the book.Moreover, David Suchet is Poirot. The details are perfect in The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd , and other movies in the series. You’ll notice Poirot is exactly what you would have imagined him to be after reading Christie’s novels: quirky, observant, witty and unimaginably intelligent. Poirot is a typical detective, finding out the murderer before anyone can put together the pieces of the murders. Keenly observant of the smallest details and not willing to abandon even the most negligible clues.Having placed all the cards of this film on the table, it becomes essential to point out that no matter how well The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd   is adapted – which it is – there is nearly nothing like reading the book. It’s a separate experience of jaw-dropping exhilaration. Watching the movie on the other hand is like assuming the position of an all-knowing parent – who knows the value of original but wants to applaud the courage of an earnest and striking visual adaptation. The debate has the same conclusion but watching The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd   will make you feel like it’s a win-win situation.

Especially considering there was nothing very unique or great about the story itself. I was mesmerized by Tabu’s acting. Simple day-to-day dialogues and none, if not necessary added to the elegance of the movie.","In general, I like movies which have a strong compelling story. Once in a while though, comes along a movie like ‘The Namesake’ where the direction, screenplay and most importantly - the acting make you forget that the story is ‘nothing spectacular’. And this is despite the fact that it is relatively slow paced.The story is no doubt a truthful and authentic narration of the average NRI family who moved abroad in the 70s - from the locations and sets to the accents and reactions of various characters. Especially, how Tabu and Irrfan lose the heavy Bangla accent gradually as the years go by. This could also mean that people who haven’t lived outside India for an extended period of time might not identify with the characters. They will enjoy the narrative nevertheless. While the characters of Ashima (Tabu) and Ashoke (Irrfan Khan) are sketched out in quite some detail and are played out beautifully, some parts of Gogol’s (Kal Penn) character seemed superficial, especially his love life. By any standards, this is a Tabu movie all the way. The lady gracefully ages from a daughter to a wife to a mother. It is amazing how with just one movement of her eye, you know exactly what her character is feeling.However, since it is a movie that tries to be as close to reality as possible, it is the missing nuances that bothered me a couple of times during the two hours. I must admit that I haven’t read the book, and this could be one of those things that didn’t find their way into the movie. High on emotions and jerking tears along the way, this one is worth a watch just for the performances. The beauty lies in the depth of the relationships touched upon. This is one of those rare occasions where how the story is told consumes the audience rather than the story itself.Update: Corrected spelling mistake - 'Ashim' replaced by 'Ashima'. Thanks Ashima (Comment #1 on notepad).

Nominated for Best Comedy at the 2010 Golden Globes, it features some sparkling comic timing and dialogue between the two misfit, loser cops played by Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. Looking for flaws in this film is a meaningless exercise - it’s similar to finding logic and reasoning in a Sajid Khan film. The screenplay still throws up enough laughs, so I’d suggest you watch this film with friends, on a relaxed weekend.","Mark Wahlberg is suddenly becoming the Akshay Kumar of Hollywood. The man with a rather straight face, is mouthing absurd, yet funny lines (“I’m a peacock! You’ve gotta let me fly!”) The same way that Akki would do in a Priyadarshan film. Wahlberg’s traits work nicely when paired with Will Ferrell, quintessentially funny man, in The Other Guys, a film about two detectives in New York’s police department who do nothing more than mundane paperwork on existing cases, rather than be a part of adrenaline pumping car chases to nail down criminals like real investigators would. Although Hoitz (Wahlberg) wants to go out and shoot some guns like real cops do, he struggles to inspire his geeky desk partner Gamble (Ferrell) to rise to the occasion and together, become the city’s heroes. The humour essentially lies in their mismatch and the pairing of the two actors is funny. There is some crackling dialogue, most of which had me in splits thanks to both actors complimenting each other well. Hoitz leaves no stone unturned to let Gamble know how much he hates him, but the total nerd that Gamble is, he doesn’t mind. Captain Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton), who plays boss to both characters is equally funny as the senior cop with a bisexual son, and who has a weekend passion of running a supermarket which sells luxury toiletries. The film is a wonderful product placement for the Toyota Prius, the car that the lead actors use for most of their assignments. I loved the way the car’s features were embedded with Gamble’s character and mannerisms. The writing and performances have enough to provoke laughter and these comic scenes are well-connected to ensure that the film is not just a series of gags one after the other. There’s something about staring at Will Ferrell’s face that produces a tingling in my funny bone. He’s one of the better slapstick actors, but one who doesn’t have to try too hard to show off his comic timing. The film is an action comedy, against the backdrop of the embezzlement of funds. There’s action - lots of it, most of which is pretty well executed. But the screenplay is patchy, a bit formulaic and I’m not sure if I can blame the writers entirely - action comedies as a genre continue to be like this. The non-stop bullying from Hoitz and Gamble’s colleagues seems forced. Moreover, I couldn’t fathom why Hoitz would want the calculator loving Gamble to join him in his investigative pursuits. How did the two become partners in the first place? A bit of history into how they met and how they became resigned to boring desk jobs, would have added some colour to the story. The sub-plot of Hoitz’s failed romance and his ability to do the ballet really well, doesn’t add up to the film’s overall proceedings in any way. The extras on the DVD are a bit of a lip-service. There are some deleted scenes - meaningless, most of them. However, the behind-the-scenes footage of the stunts is interesting, as are the interviews with the director and the actors.The Other Guys has got several flaws, in addition to everything that comes with a formulaic script. But it’s a funny film alright.

Right at the onset, I must confess that I am not a great fan of Steve Martin.
Yes, I have seen some of his films; Sgt Bilko, The Father of the Bride are the names that come to mind.  I have also seen Planes, Trains, and Automobiles as well as Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.  As films I enjoyed the last two more, primarily because you had John Candy and Michael Caine respectively, acting in them.  But Steve Martin had never really left an impression on me with respect to his comic abilities.  The role of the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau was initially played by the great comic genius, Peter Sellers, in five films, all directed by Blake Edwards.  Some of the films were really funny, with Sellers in great form, as the French Detective.  So it was very difficult to watch Steve Martin enact the character and not compare it with Seller’s version, even though one knows that comparisons might prove to be inherently unfair.
(I believe that Steve Martin has been crying himself hoarse saying that he has not played Clouseau as Sellers would have done, but instead interpreted it differently).The plot is shopworn and is a reworking of the earlier Pink Panther films.  The supporting cast are all fine actors with the likes of Andy Garcia, Alfredo Molina, Lily Tomlin, Jean Reno, and heaven help us, Jeremy Irons.  They have absolutely nothing to do in the film except look foolish and irritated at alternate intervals.  Yes, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is there too, as Sonia, but she is mainly kept in the background.  John Cleese plays Dreyfuss, Clouseau’s boss (a role made famous by Herbert Lom in the original Pink Panther films) and he is completely wasted too.  The screenplay really lets the film down; it is extremely predictable and seems to consist only of the gags.  When it tries to do other things, it ends up creating the character of Mrs. Berenger (played by Lily Tomlin) who tries to teach Clouseau political correctness.  This could have been the basis of a whole set of witty dialogues / situations parodying today’s world, but no, what we get instead are very banal and boring situations.  Steve Martin struts around through a series of set piece slapstick gags, but the gags are flat and insipid.  There is not a single gag that makes you laugh hilariously; you have Martin as the Pope, you have Martin choosing wine, you have Martin investigating a large mansion, you have Martin as a flamenco dancer, and you have Martin practicing karate with his side kick’s children (another reworking from the original Peter Seller’s films), but it all comes across as extremely labored.  The most irritating thing about Martin is his accent; with Sellers, the faux French accent was hilarious, with Martin it is the equivalent of a red, itchy rash that one would like to get rid of post haste.  Martin maintains an immobile visage, his face frozen into something between a pout and a sneeze.  The climax is as hackneyed as the rest of the movie, with Martin jumping and dodging various objects.  Slapstick routines require terrific physicality as in a Buster Keaton or a Charlie Chaplin; Martin unfortunately just does not have it.  He also does not have the superb timing, the confidence, and the varied body language that Peter Sellers' Clouseau had; neither is Martin a master of disguise.  Martin comes across as a total chump busy clowning around desperately in order to attract attention. (Or is that his interpretation of Clouseau?)  The film is a total bummer; the only sounds of laughter were from a bunch of ten year olds in the theatre. I would like to think that they laughed the loudest when Martin was getting the worst of it.  Need anything more be said?PS It was a pleasure to hear the theme music again: the only saving grace of the film is the excellent background score by Christophe Beck.

If I had to try my best to describe what’s missing, I’d say, “A destination.” That can be both, a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how you look at it. I’ve always disliked it when someone, after they know I’ve watched a particular film, asks me, “So what is the film about?” I hate attempting to distill an entire film into a few lines of prose. But with this particular film, I wouldn’t be able to even if I tried. The Place Beyond the Pines talks about characters, about choices and about consequences. It deals with loneliness, with morality, with responsibility and with survival instincts. Not out of laziness, but for the purpose of illustrating something, I’m reproducing the official synopsis of the film below. “A motorcycle stunt rider turns to robbing banks as a way to provide for his lover and their newborn child, a decision that puts him on a collision course with an ambitious rookie cop navigating a department ruled by a corrupt detective.” That, dear reader, is precisely what the film is not about. Ryan Gosling’s motorcycle stunt rider and Bradley Cooper’s rookie cop are mere eyewashes; quite like Blue Valentine, this film too is set around men who are failures, even if some of them seem to don the garb of being successful. In fact, Derek Cianfrance seems to have made it a pattern. The men in his films always seem to be talented people who are perpetual underachievers, no matter how hard they try. The women, on the other hand, seem have to deal with the grotesqueries of their respective men’s personalities. The film also subtly shows the butterfly effect; the consequences to one’s actions, that are often so far-reaching in time and space, that you can only truly know it when you are watching it from the outside; if you are a viewer at the cinema, or if you are God. What defines right and wrong? Does one right undo a wrong that has been done? No? Then do two rights undo one wrong? No? Then how many rights does it take? Who defines it? The world is an orgy of shades of grey, and cinema very rarely tries to explore that. Even the films that do portray grey characters often do it at a superficial level – they’ll show a backstory of a man seeking redemption for some aspect of his personality, ultimately coming up trumps in the end.Cianfrance fastidiously avoids black and white, with every single character that appears before you. They’ve all got chinks in their personality, and none of them ever venture too much out of the grey spectrum. And every single character in the film, no matter how big or small, is a loner. In fact, the sense of loneliness hangs through the film.The terrific cast, especially Gosling and Cooper, play out the melancholy quite well. Gosling’s character does seem like a cocktail of some of his previous characters, particularly the ones from Drive and Blue Valentine, but he always seems to add in that little bit extra in his voice and body language, which makes him so great in every role that he plays. Bradley Cooper’s character, now that I think of it, also seems to be a mix of his characters from Limitless and Silver Linings Playbook, except that he actually manages to seem like an uncomfortable young rookie when he has to. Also, his character has the widest, steepest graph in the film, and he pulls it off.The talented Ben Mendelsohn, again, plays a character that reminds you of him in Andrew Dominik’s Killing Them Softly, but he is excellent as always. Eva Mendes looks appropriately haggard, in keeping with her character. I’ve never been a fan of her acting prowess. Here too, she’s good, but never great. Ray Liotta is superb, subtly menacing, in a tiny role.When I left the theatre after the film, I couldn’t believe just how much the film had traversed in its runtime. It meandered often, and some of the situations were downright implausible. Still, because of the sheer pertinence and relevance of the some of the questions that the film raises, it is bound to gnaw away at you even hours after you’ve watched it. Then, there are some beautiful frames that say so much; ones that will stay with you for a while. The Place Beyond the Pines is the kind of film that will reward you for your patience, but it’ll take some time to realize that what you got in return was actually a reward.

Subtle humor to on-the-face silliness makes it easy to keep that smile on for the entire 90 minutes.,"President Bush has provided us with loads of entertainment over the last eight years. So what if they were with headshakes-in-despair.  Six Indians who represent the other billion of us wait for a handshake-in-desperation with THE man in The President is coming. It is as much a comment on our obsession as a nation with the American dream - love it or hate it - as it is about the nation who chose this man twice to lead their nation! A Math nerd, a farmer, a stockbroker, a wannabe-Paris-Hilton, an accent trainer and a leftist novelist - are all motivated to meet President Bush on his visit to India. If that wasn't diversity enough - one of them is a South Indian, one a hardcore Maratha, another a Gujrati, then a Bengali and two ""better-exposed"" city-bred youngsters. You can imagine the amount of fun this medley can cause all thanks to of course - stereotyping. And they do it largely without slapstick!! Filled to the last bit with sarcasm, The President is coming is consistent with the typecasts it initiates. It's not satire for the sake of satire. The characters are all someone you might've met - at work, in family, amongst friends, friends of friends. Which is why it is charming and the humor keeps you engaged. At no point is it rolling-on-the-floor-laughing, but I found myself snickering throughout. Yeah, in many ways it makes you feel good about yourself - Like you are not one of them, though they have been chosen to represent you - the youth of India - to a foreigner.Each character is also the extreme of the stereotype it represents, almost on the border of exaggeration, but you know it's not. The writer takes you to the brink of a believable character and very smartly stops. Yet, a lot of the plot is contrived. And I'm not even talking of the basic premise. There are tangents that the movie goes off on which are kind-of to exhibit a character's quirk. But, since 8 characters are being squished together in 90 minutes, many of these remain half-baked.And yet, the movie is enjoyable like a sitcom. Enjoy the now of the joke. And this is possible because of some awesome casting. From the guy who plays the geek from Bengalooru to the possibly-illiterate stockbroker. Needless to say you can laugh only if the dialogues are bright and they are timed well. And this combination occurs often enough.It is one of those that you see on a lazy Sunday afternoon when you are in the mood for something light and when you are done you forget it. No more and no less.

A worthy follow-up to the first film, Gareth Evans serves us yet another possible cult action flick.","Gareth Evans’ 2011 flick, The Raid: Redemption, (which was dubbed into English and released worldwide in 2012,) very quickly became a cult action flick. It had some of the best cable-less action you’ve seen on screen, and had a gritty punch to it that made it a relentless, albeit extremely violent, action entertainer. That film had a threadbare plot, to be honest, but it worked because of just how good the fight scenes were.Evans now takes it a step further, with The Raid 2. The action scenes, in terms of screen-time have been cut down in favour of an actual plot; not one that’s particularly novel, if you think about it, but one that makes for an interesting setting for the high octane action you expect from a sequel to The Raid. Think of it as a Yakuza film on crack.Rookie cop Rama from the previous film, (who miraculously made it out of that film alive!) is now convinced to go undercover to infiltrate and help destroy a crime syndicate that has control over the streets of his beloved city. The mafia, of course, has its own politics at play.If you go in expecting to be hooked to the action from the word go, you’ll be disappointed; because a lot of time is spent establishing the setting and how Rama works his way in and upwards in the crime organization. Evans had a much higher budget this time round, and it shows. In terms of treatment, the film is quite different from its predecessor - smooth and precise camera movements, a multitude of locations, a nice non-linear editing pattern in certain scenes, and an overall superior production quality. The hardcore action scenes are still there, of course, and they’re quite terrific. There is plenty of violent bloodshed, so this film is definitely not for those who aren’t fans of raw violence. Apart from the sprinkling it throughout the film, action fans will be satisfied with what they go in to the film for with just one particular car chase scene in the latter half. It is executed with such imagination and raw energy, that it will leave you salivating. What one misses, however, is the threat of Rama’s cover blowing. The film concentrates so much on the political machinations at play in the crime world that you never really get a sense of danger about the fact that Rama might be discovered for what he truly is. The story lacks a sense of urgency about it. Adding that to the film could truly have taken it someplace else.Personally speaking, I’d have been more than happy to see even more action in the film, because that’s what made The Raid so much fun. Yet, The Raid 2offers enough adrenaline-pumping stuff to keep you hooked, and if you set your expectations right, the plot works as well. Evans has firmly established himself as a genre specialist, and The Raid 3 has already been announced, and will certainly be a film to watch out for.

517,1217,1217,1217,1217,The Reader,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma reviewNotepad5 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/the-reader-review/,,5/5.0,,4.866666667,"A love story, between two disparate characters that examines the frailties of the human condition.","That the specter of the Holocaust continues to prey upon the psyche of Europe and to some extent America, as evinced by the number of films and documentaries that are made with unceasing regularity, nearly seventy years post World War II, comes as no surprise, given the agony and torment that the Holocaust generated. Some of the notables in the recent past have included, Roman Polanski’s The Pianist, Roberto Benigni’s Life is Beautiful, and Steven Spielberg’s Schindler’s List.  Most of them have depicted events from the Jewish point of view; of suffering Jews struggling for survival in the face of extreme cruelty perpetrated by the Nazis, or else they have been about people who in some way rescued Jews from the “Final Solution”. The Reader deals with the Holocaust too, but presents itself fundamentally as a love story and a tale of lost innocence; a love story between two highly disparate individuals who in some ways are quite like each other. The film follows a non linear narrative; continuously juxtaposing the present with the remembered past and then plunging back into the not so recent present. This could get confusing for some viewers; but as one has to follow the lives of primarily the two main characters and their encounters with each other, a little patience is well rewarded. Stephen Daldry who earlier gave us the beautifully understated Billy Elliot is in charge here, and he makes a solid job of it. The film opens with an adult Michael Berg played by Ralph Fiennes, ruminating over his past where he has a chance encounter with Hannah (Kate Winslet). We do not see Fiennes for nearly two thirds of the film, except in brief moments, as the story is about his younger self and that is played by David Kross. The first half of the film is shot in soft focus and in warm colours, highlighting the first flush of love for the young Michael and also possibly the discovery of his own sexuality. This phase of the film comes across as idyllic, and we slowly come to understand that both Michael and Hannah have some things in common. The rest of the film then deals with more traumatic events, events that have influenced a nation and whose very presence seeps into the lives of future generations. The film raises questions about collective guilt, shame, individual choice and responsibility, and the notion of justice as different from law and morality. These issues are teased out through the lives of the two protagonists, who exemplify “normal” individuals, but from two different generations. Both protagonists have made choices, and continue to make them, but we are never very sure about their motives. This ambiguity in both the characters is highlighted repeatedly, thus possibly making us aware of the shortcomings of being human; shortcomings for which we have no clear answers. The strength of the film lies in how it takes the overarching theme of the Holocaust and examines it through the perspective of two ordinary German citizens. The script builds layers by commenting on the nature of forgiveness and reconciliation, by examining the role of the legal system, and by depicting the tremendous repercussions such “historic” events have on day to day living. The film has no heart stopping moments, no heart wrenching dialogues; it is deeply emotional but it is all done in a subtle and restrained manner. As with life, the film does not offer us a closure and a neat resolution, and questions remain unanswered. Ralph Fiennes is a pleasure to watch as always, while David Kross portrays the adolescent and later the troubled young Michael Berg, very well. Kate Winslet’s ample curves are on display early on in the film, but it is in her face and her eyes, that her character germinates. The Reader is not an easy film to watch especially for Indian viewers; we have nothing comparable to the Holocaust embedded in our collective consciousness. True, the Partition and its related cruelty and inhumanity have happened, but they seem to have been completely buried as far as popular culture is concerned, barring a stray film here and there. That the Partition has spawned and continues to spawn intolerance and violence has not really been examined and commented upon. That could possibly be because we as a Nation, collectively reject notions of History, and instead are very comfortable embracing Mythology in its stead. The Reader is a very European film, in the sense that it examines History through a critical lens and digs deep into the collective well spring of national consciousness. Definitely worth a dekkho. PS. The film uses the leit motif of reading and of a literary consciousness to underscore the lives of the two protagonists. Again very European, this use of literature and literacy as a perspective on human thought and action.

Perhaps worth a watch for some, because of the look-and-feel it creates and for the lead performance by Riz Ahmed, it is nevertheless seldom more than just watchable.","It seems all Hollywood has to offer us this week are adaptations of books. Mira Nair’s screen adaptation of Pakistani author Mohsin Hamid’s 2007 book ‘The Reluctant Fundamentalist’ appealed to me instantly because of the gritty, haunting atmosphere it creates right from the first frame of the film. However, it seldom manages to move you because of the broad, over-dramatic manner in which the story is treated. Mira Nair seems to have thrown everything she had at this film, but decided to leave subtlety in her back pocket.Set around a fictitious incident of international significance and traveling back-and-forth in time to reveal the journey of the protagonist, the film had all the potential to be a taut, gripping thriller which subtly puts forth the message that it holds – of how every man is responsible for his own choices and that in an ideal world, religion would have nothing to with it. However, it is the simplistic and loud treatment that lets the film down almost completely, despite having so much else going for it.
The film is, at its heart, an intimate story of Changez Khan, a Pakistani lad who aspires for what most of his generation in this part of the world aspire for; success in the ultimate land of dreams and opportunity – the United States of America. Built around this central premise is a story of despair, injustice, fanaticism and ambiguous morality that is a repercussion of the most ingeniously horrifying terror attack in the history of mankind. The film tackles a theme that seems staple – how the life of a young Pakistani man, living the age-old ‘American Dream’, changes completely, post 9/11. It shows you what you’ve already seen or heard before – about how every person of South East Asian decent, specifically, every man with a Muslim surname or with a beard, was targeted and singled out for suspicion and eventual degradation and humiliation. Changez’s journey starts off truly engaging you; a lot of this has to do with the performance of Riz Ahmed. The graph of his character, the slow build up of aspirations and love are wonderfully captured by his physicality as well as his eyes. Then, despite the eventual direction that his character takes being established too weakly, Ahmed holds fort and manages to carry you along with him. However, the film primarily fails in what sets this film apart from a regular emotional tale – the thriller format of the narrative. Then there is the black-and-white as opposed to the gray that a story like this should stand for. I haven’t read the novel, so I don’t know if the sharp lines with which characters and situations are etched are derived from the source itself. However, I couldn’t help get the feeling that the book was essentially a film masquerading as a novel – the story and narrative technique appear to have such strong cinematic potential that a film adaptation was almost inevitable. Add to that the visual treatment that Nair gives to the film; I eventually lost count of how many times I told myself what a lost chance this film is.Riz Ahmed’s performance is ably supported by the rest of the cast. Shabana Azmi and Om Puri, who play his Pakistani parents, are a joy despite their brief roles. Kiefer Sutherland as Changez’s ice-cool, ambitious boss is perfect as well. Liev Schreiber who plays a journalist and one half of the conversation that is the core situation around which the film is set, does a fair job, but I often felt that he lacked the intensity that Riz Ahmed had. And how one wishes that the terrific Adil Hussain had more to do than just smile and mutter in a couple of scenes.The film also has a charming little Sufi-flavoured background score that has more than one good song. In fact, as I said earlier, the film had a lot going for it which makes it a fair technical achievement. It is in the overdone dramatics and thrill factor that the film really loses the plot. The Reluctant Fundamentalist is the kind of film I’d only recommend to those who feel satisfied by a film if even just a few aspects of it – the mood, visuals and Riz’s performance in this case – work. Otherwise, it may be hard to find the film anything more than passable.

Andrei Zvyagintsev’s hypnotic suspense thriller, The Return, is one of the best films to come out of Russia. Eerie, brooding and cheerless, this film kept me guessing like none other. A story about how the lives of two young boys are shattered when their father suddenly re-appears after a period of 12 years, The Return is cold, deep and flows like a calm mist, until it arrives at a climax you’d never have anticipated. Winner of the Golden Lion at Venice International Film Festival, nominee for Best Foreign Language Film at Golden Globes, Academy Awards and for the Golden Leopard at the Locarno Film Festival.","I love cinema that can be discussed like a Maths question paper after coming out of the examination hall. Where participants / viewers can compare mental notes. Questions like “What do you think happened to him?”, “Why did he do that?”, “Where did he come from?” It gives the film the much needed mind-space to exist beyond its stipulated running time.The Return is a film in a similar genre. By not making details about the central character’s background explicitly clear, director Zvyagintsev heightens the mystery in this thriller to enormous proportions, and solves itself only partially by the end of the film. However, unlike most mysteries, this one has got no scam, murder or robbery connected to it.Somewhere in Russia, two young boys - Andrei (Vladimir) and Ivan (Ivan) - are shocked to discover one day that their father, who they believed was no more, has suddenly come home. We’re not told where the father (Konstantin) was, all this while. The mother doesn’t explain, nor do the boys get any answers from the man himself. Even as the two of them jump at the idea of an extended fishing trip that the father proposes, they can only hope that they get to know him better.I haven’t seen a film like this, before. The film is intense, brooding and eerie throughout. You’re left guessing whether the father is a ghost, a dictator or a stranger bent on using the kids to further his own means. Why did he suddenly propose the fishing trip? Where is he taking them? Does he want his boys to turn into men? Why doesn’t he tell them where he was all this while? These are questions that keep crossing your mind throughout. Interestingly, these are the same questions that are troubling the two boys as well and making difficult for them to trust the man completely. If you look deeper, Ivan and Andrei represent two faces of a human mind when faced with a mystery - the former is questioning and rebellious, while the latter more easily accepting of things the way they are.There are times when you place yourself in the father’s shoes and realise you can’t blame him for the way he is. He’s been absconding for 12 years. He’s not even familiar with the world of his two boys - what are their likes, dislikes. Scenes where he asks Andrei to settle the  bill at a restaurant, or shows them how to get the car wheel out of muddy track, or how to punch a guy who robbed the two of their money - all point towards him wanting his sons to stand up on their feet and defend themselves. In a way, you can never fully convince yourself that the father is a villain in the film because everytime you feel so, he tops it up with something that makes him endearing. It heightens the mystery about the back-story of the father.The irony of the screenplay - and this is the film’s biggest strength which fuels the suspense - is the mood of the three characters during the trip. Here they are, going on a fishing trail through the beautiful countryside. But there’s very little they speak with each other. The photography captures their mood perfectly, lending itself beautifully to the film’s cheerless feel. The director shows a particular fascination for landscapes, especially water, and you’ll know why, when you see the film.The climax is breathtaking and easily the biggest highlight of the film. The shock, and the character’s reaction to the shock and what follows after, left me with sweaty palms. The closing sequence (a fond tribute to that of The Motorcyle Diaries), seals the films and beautifully, it left me immensely satisfied.I loved Ivan’s performance in the film. Despite being a child actor, he is the perfect nemesis for his father. Shot mostly through close-ups, he is the most well-written character in the film, after his father. Konstantin fits the role to a T and his tall, lean figure and athletic build point to the character’s history somewhere in military Russia.I can only imagine what a high it must have been to discover this film at a film festival. The film is made of stuff that can make you smile in satisfaction for the discovery of a fine, new directorial voice from Russia. An outstanding debut, by all measures.

520,1220,1220,1220,1220,The Riddle,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review,/movie/riddle-review/,,,,4.2,"The Riddle is NOT complicated, interesting and exciting. It DOESN’T play with your mind, making you think of the possible subplots and layers to the story and it most certainly is NOT worth your time. Consider this a disclaimer against indulgent, arrogant films that take their craft a little too seriously. ","You would think a 7.1 IMDB rating and a cast line-up including Vinne Jones (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) is a good enough reason to pick up a film – more so a film about secretive riddles going back to Charles Dickens. When I picked up the DVD of The Riddle I thought to myself, this should be a nail-bitter. My nails are bitten anyway, but that’s because I was bored – and therefore I present to you this disclaimer. Don’t Never judge a book by its cover.  Having said that – let me allow you to get blown away by the synopsis, also the only gripping part of the film. The Riddle is a contemporary mystery thriller that sparks off with a woman’s murder, after she finds an unpublished Charles Dickens manuscript. We see the film through the eyes of Mike (Vinne Jones) who is an aspiring investigative journalist. While he is tracking down the script, we are escalated into the world of yesterday, and only after they unlock the mystery of yesterday, will they be able to solve today’s crime.Unlike what it seems The Riddle does not have a labyrinthine pace, where everything folds one after another in quick succession.  After sitting through the film that sounds positively intelligent, you keep wondering if you’ve missed something, maybe you’re not getting the layers after all. All those thoughts will vanish with the climax. I wouldn’t call it a joke, but after you’ve pulled yourself together for almost 2 hours, you’re hoping all will be redeemed with a revelation in the end – but you get zilch. It’s almost too ridiculous to be true.The film could have been passable had the writers taken themselves a little less seriously – maybe made a genuine thriller that follows a simple pattern of establishing-churning-revealing. On the other hand, what The Riddle does is get absorbed in its own arrogance, sunken too deep into what they think is a fabulous story. Vinne Jones is a tad bit wasted, although his acting seems earnest. The look and feel of the film does match up to its era (with the production design and the costumes) with deep blacks and grungy hues. Sadly you’d be able to notice all of this only if you can move past the ghastly play of events that the film has to offer. And therefore, the writing is the main problem with The Riddle. The crime scenes are fairly played out well, with the sound effects and background score. It could have been a half decent film had the writing been cross-checked at a development stage.The only extra in the DVD is an extended trailer of the film, which honestly is the best part of the entire DVD. The trailer is crisp, sounds and looks good and has the core concept of the film down to perfection. My humble suggestion would be to remake the film, taking it from the trailer and making it more coherent, tight and mildly entertaining at points. Not because one needs those elements to enjoy a film, but for this plot it’s necessary to carry the add-ons. It’s a hard task to offer a critique of a film which is fundamentally all wrong. You don’t know how to deconstruct it further and go deep into the layers to offer suggestions. But one of the main reasons why I decided to go this was to bring a crucial point to everyone’s attention. Some bad films should have never been made but there are some films that have interesting concepts and the problem mostly lies with execution. The Riddle belongs to the latter category.Also, for future reference, please evaluate a film with your own rating.

521,1221,1221,1221,1221,The Sea Inside,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/sea-inside-review/,,5/5.0,,4.866666667,"By far the biggest inspiration for Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s  Guzaarish , The Sea Inside beautifully breathes life into death and the deep desire for it. Most importantly, it does so in a believable manner. Javier Bardem gives the performance of a lifetime, wonderfully helmed by director Alejandro Amenabar (The Others). A tear jerker that treads the fine line between drama and melodrama, with utmost maturity. Winner of the Best Foreign Language Film at the 2004 Oscars, Golden Globes and the Venice Film Festival.","There is a sequence in The Sea Inside, where Ramon Sampedro (Javier Bardem), a quadriplegic for 30 years, is driven to court. Ramon has been fighting to legalize death by euthanasia, beginning with his own, much against his family's wishes.  During that drive, he sees some everyday, routine sights from the window of his vehicle - a mother beating up her child, a man cycling his way up along the countryside, and so on  Beautifully shot, the sequence is a fantastic recollection of his life's journey, his victories, his liberties, his failures and unfulfilled desires. It's one of the most memorable visuals  The Sea Inside.The Sea Inside's settings are believable, and the relationships between the characters are richly layered, thanks to an ably chosen supporting cast who form Ramon's support system. The depth of their relationships, even as they go about doing their regular chores is depicted with much maturity. New characters appear - another quadriplegic, for example, who disturbs the family equilibrium temporarily - but it only re-affirms their love and faith towards Ramon, despite him being a burden on them. There's love and of different kinds. The relationship of Sampedro with Julia (Belen Rueda), a lawyer with a heart disease, fighting for Sampedro's cause, is a stark contrast to that of Rosa (Lola Duenas), a lonely single mother, who on seeing Sampedro's interview on television, is drawn towards him, and tries to convince him to continue living. The drama between the characters is never overstated (Rosa's unwillingness to see Julia with Sampedro, for example). Despite Sampedro's condition, his personality and the sexual undercurrents in Julia's company are handled extremely well. (A scene where Julia is helping Sampedro smoke a cigarrette, is stunningly shot). A dinner scene between the family members and a quiet Ramon lying on bed upstairs, show his isolation from the rest of the world, in strong contrasting visuals. There are few directors who can ably hold a film so well in various departments -  Amenabar is not only the director, but also the writer, editor and music composer for the film. The film is often lyrical, almost poetic in the manner in which Ramon's thoughts blur all lines between reality and fantasy. Despite his immobility, he is able to move the lives of several others. Despite him having loved and lost, he wants to be loved again and his true lover is someone, who would help his cause i.e. relieve him of his condition. One of the common traits of great cinema is that by the time the credits roll, you feel richer - in emotion, in thought, in quotable lines. This film has plenty of them. At its core, the film makes the viewer attempt one simple question, ""If you love someone deeply, would you help him/her die when in pain?"" Interestingly, the film's subject of euthanasia is similar to Million Dollar Baby, which won the Best Picture in the same year as The Sea Inside. I've seen both, but I enjoy some sort of magic in a film’s story-telling, something which transports the viewer much beyond the confines of his seat. In my view, Amenabar succeeds in doing that much better than Clint Eastwood. I'm also sucker for drama and tragedy, and I hunt down DVDs of tear-jerkers with the passion of a Nazi hunting a Jew. Overall,  The Sea Inside is cinematographic achievement from Spain, a country earlier known best for Pedro Almodovar (Broken Embraces, All About My Mother, Volver), but now, thanks to Amenabar, is exporting a new accomplished product. Beautiful.

Little Miss Sunshine was one such film and here’s another gem from France, The Secret of the Grain. The screenplay and dialogues are so fluid, it never seems like there was a written screenplay. The actors just understood their roles and acted them out. The riot of voices this creates, makes the characters almost become part of your living room. At 153 minutes, it seems long, but definitely recommended viewing.","Through most of The Secret of the Grain’s 153-minute duration, you get a sense that there isn’t a director to this film. There is a cameraman, invisible somewhere, and an editor with an intuition so perfect that he cuts this film, like none other. You, the viewer are an observer amidst the characters in the world of of the recently laid-off 61-year old Slimane’s world. A world that’s not a perfect family - Slimane is divorced. His ex-wife Souad complains about alimony payments not being on time and keeps him away from the family get-together every Sunday. His current wife Latifa and her daughter Rym love him and despite having to dodge some serious red tape in a quiet port town in France, he wants to start a restaurant on a boat. The main attraction at this new eatery: couscous, something which Souad cooks really well. At least on paper, the storyline unfolds like a family-drama with just the right layers to keep you engrossed. But being engrossed is an understatement. Director Abdellatif Kechiche’s treatment of the script is such, that it makes you want to tear into the screen and make the characters stop howling, offer a shoulder to comfort them and at other times, even join their celebrations. Kechiche does this by shooting the characters through tight close-ups - there’s a family get-together scene, for example, which has been shot and edited with such meticulous care and precision that the cacophony of chatter it generates is loud and real enough to make your neighbours feel you’ve got French guests in your house. Halfway through these scenes, I realised that I was smiling, not for any jokes being bandied about, but simply for the joy of being able to observe a family have a merry time together at a meal. In several scenes, it also appears that the director is also lenient with saying ‘cut’. He lets the drama boil, the characters continue to bawl, argue and shout and as a viewer, you want him to end the scene and move on to the next one, but he doesn’t. He lets it froth a little further, until you’re holding your head in your hands, a bit awestruck at the performances and a bit disturbed with what just unfolded on screen. The delicacy of couscous plays a crucial role in the film. Comprised of grain, fish, vegetables and sauce, it is the staple diet of the minority community that Slimane and his extended family belong to. It is it’s preparation that brings the extended family together, not just on weekends but also to work as one unit to get the new restaurant up and running. It becomes clear, that despite differences amongst people, food is therapeutic in bringing people together. The film, for most parts looks so real and believable thanks to its performances. I must mention Hafzia Herzi, who plays Rym, Slimane’s daughter and puts in an incredible performance especially towards the end. It’s the visual highlight of the film. There’s Alice Houri, who plays Julia, a Russian married to Slimane’s philanderer son Hamid, who gives the most incredible single-take bawling performance I’ve seen. Her outburst is so long and disturbing, I thought my nerves would burst. By thanking his father in the end credits of the film, The Secret of the Grain, seems autobiographical and one can’t help but relate Slimane to Kechiche’s own father. Habib Boufares, who plays Slimane, has a resigned look on his face throughout the film, but his determination to renovate a scrap boat and start a new business, is re-assuring, signifying that no matter how cold the war be between your present (Latifa and Rym) and past (ex-wife and family), with a little cajoling and effort, everybody comes together for fresh beginnings. That’s a great thought to begin the New Year with, isn’t it? Don’t miss this film. PS: Happy New Year, folks!

Not being a huge fan of Basu Chatterjee's film either, didn't help. But, that The Shaukeens would have no redeeming factor whatsoever, was disappointing. I don't consider myself a prude or conservative, but watching the likes of Anupam Kher, Annu Kapoor and Piyush Mishra as lechers isn't my idea of fun. It doesn't help that Lisa Haydon seems to be playing dumb, but looks too smart to be playing so dumb. That's not to say, that they don't act well. At least the men. They do their jobs well enough to creep out any woman in their vicinity - both on screen and in the audience.I don't really have much more to say about this one except that I had to keep comparisons with my all-time worst film ever, *Buddha Mar Gaya * at bay.

movie. It is the story about the founders of Facebook. And I say
'founders' because it is as much the story of Eduardo Saverin (Andrew
Garfield)  as it is of Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg). It is the
story of how money and success changes the equation between the people
behind Facebook. The tagline of the movie couldn't have been more
accurate - You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few
enemies. We've seen it with Bill Gates and now, we've seen it with
Zuckerberg. You can't achieve so much without stepping onto some
stones. And Mark sure stepped on plenty. So this movie is about
heartbreak, friendship, greed, betrayal, success and of course,
Facebook.","With over 500 million users, Facebook is by far, the largest social
networking site around. Facebook started in a Harward dorm room in
2003 by Mark Zuckerberg who went on to become the youngest billionaire
in the world. The movie uses the lawsuits against Mark, to tell the
back-story of how he came to achieve all that he did, pretty much like
Slumdog Millionare used the show 'Who wants to become a millionaire'
to carry their story forward. And like Slumdog Millionare, here too,
the formula worked like a charm. In pieces, it showed the changes in
Mark's character from the time he was a neglected undergrad to the
time he became a billionaire.I've grown up reading stories about Bill Gates and how many people he
allegedly wronged on his path to success. Its Zuckerberg's time to be
under the torch. The movie would leave you with mixed emotions. You'd
love Mark for his genius and his passion towards Facebook. At the same
time you'd hate him for his cockiness and betrayals. So after the
movie, be prepared to jump in to the intense debates of who wronged
whom and how much of the movie is fact and how much is fiction. Its
good fun, as from ex-Facebook CTOs, employees and founders all are
having their say over the matter. Coming back to the movie, Aaron
Sorkin did a great job with the script. It was driven with sharp
dialogues that make this movie a fast paced entertainer, and not a
documentary. The surprise package for me was Justin Timberlake in the
role of Sean Parker. I had little hopes from him, but he pulled off the
role pretty nicely. Also, if you don't know the story behind Sean
Parker, do read it after watching the movie and you'd love his
character more.All in all, The Social Network, is a brilliant movie to watch, to enjoy,
to get inspired and to have a healthy debate with friends.
Release date for India couldn't have been timed better with all the
heat between Google and Facebook. Also Facebook is rumored to launch
its alleged Gmail-killer soon. And we thought Microsoft vs Apple was
the epic battle. I won't be surprised to see a sequel a few years down
the line about either Facebooks downfall or about it, dominating the
world. Time shall tell. The only turn-off for me was all the
programmers in the movie were made to talk really fast. They always
make the geeks talk fast. Its like an unsaid code.
We-don't-talk-that-fast. Wait. May-be-we-do. Dayum!

Ostriches, goldfish, kids, Reza Naji and the wonderful people of Iran. Fans of Majidi’s works will know it’s a typical formula - a character in dilemma to fulfill a purpose. But it’s the journey where Majidi spins magic. It’s a genuine mood lifter, highly deserving of repeat viewing. Winner of Best Actor at the Berlin International Film Festival (2008) and nominated for Golden Berlin Bear.","Majid Majidi’s universe is full of do-gooders. It’s where you can trust people with your money. No matter how economically challenged you are, you’re always kind to share your meal with a guest. Customers at a shop don’t whisk away extra-change you may have handed over by mistake. People are extremely hospitable, welcoming and innocent. Crime, murders are unheard of. People tell lies, but for a larger good. There are no human villians in his films. If any, the enemy is a product of circumstances - often intangible, something the protagonist must overcome. That’s exactly the context of The Song of Sparrows. Karim (Reza Naji) who works at an ostrich farm on the outskirts of Tehran, wants to loan some money from his boss, so that he can buy a hearing aid for his daughter since the one she used to wear has stopped working after it fell in a dirty cesspool. Poor Karim faces an uphill task to generate that money, after he gets fired from his job thanks to a moment of  carelessness that leads an ostrich to escape from the farm.The Song of Sparrows captures Karim’s loss of innocence as he frequents the city every day posing as a motorbike pilot who ferries people and heavy goods. Although he earns well by doing this, every piece of city scrap he begins to accumulate in his backyard becomes a symbol of the degradation of the generous and good-hearted Karim he was once known for.It’s a fantastic message, told most beautifully through simple vignettes - Karim’s refusal to part with a beautiful blue door his wife donated to the neighbours, his violent outrage when he spots his children selling roses on the highway - all these become signs of a Karim who is now as acid tongued as the grime his face  accumulates driving around the city all day. Through Karim’s character, Majidi’s not saying that life in the city is bad; he’s just saying that people change when they spend a lot of time in an urban setup. It’s a universal truth, isn’t it? Something snaps inside Karim in this daily grind to the city. He loses something that his family and friends treasured about him. The film’s plot is about how he regains his old self, under pressure from circumstances and a little help from his family.Visually, this is one of Majidi’s most arresting films - so arresting, you can almost smell the Irani soil. The first 15 minutes of the film are pure eye candy where lensman Tooraj Mansuri’s camera captures the grace of an ostrich run and the aburdity of a chase, against the dry landscape. They are my most lasting impressions of the film. The close-ups of Karim’s face throughout the course of the film are important - you discover that Reza Naji is so good, just a tweak of his cheek muscles is worth a thousand emotions stirred up inside him.Majidi’s films always have a hidden relationship with water. It’s also a case in The Song of Sparrows, except he adds another regular from his films - goldfish. Part of the film’s official poster, a scene involving the transportation of hundreds of goldfish, is the most moving sequences in the film, shot with Majidi’s characteristic slow-motion. I found myself in tears by the end of it.I’ve seen almost all of Majidi’s internationally acclaimed films so far - Children of Heaven, The Colour of Paradise, Pedar, Baran. This film is the latest addition. As it got over and I settled down to mull over the film, I found myself asking one question: Does Majidi’s universe really exist? Are Persians genuinely as good as Majidi portrays them to be? Interestingly, while I may not be sure about answers to those questions, I’m at least convinced about one thing - we always manage to sympathise with the protagonists of his films. Perhaps that’s why people all over the world love his films. Perhaps that’s why they’re acclaimed by both critics and audiences globally - a feat sometimes very difficult to achieve. Perhaps that’s why they call him Magic Majidi.

Unfortunately, we get 2-3 extra minutes at each twist to predict the next move. And this mars what otherwise could have been a superb thriller.","An unsolved mystery in real life has so many potential climaxes. Our imagination is the only limitation. Writer-director Manish Gupta's imagination brings us his plausible solution to the unresolved case of the stoneman murders in the 80s and it's an interesting one too. Only that it has hiccups in the form of drama. That slight over-dramatization that gives the audience a couple minutes to think and makes the shocker twist into an ""I knew it!"" victory moment for them.In general, every time a protagonist finds himself in a corner with very little room to escape it makes us want to root for him even harder. And you sense the claustrophobia when doors slowly start closing in on Sanjay (Kay Kay Menon). Fingers being pointed at him, an unhappy wife, a senior who might just be using him as a means to an end, a colleague who's out to get him, a junior who's not completely in-sync with him - all stars aligning themselves just right to make life miserable for him. The writing is actually reasonably gripping. It has its twists, turns, and re-twists that fit into the short run-time. But it needs more meat for the other characters. The wife, the colleague - could have been delved more into. We are allowed nowhere close to the killer's psyche. Then again, that might not be the point of the movie. Also the language used is extremely inconsistent and distracting. A character who speaks Hindi with a very heavy Bombay dialect suddenly spouts a phrase in chaste Hindi.  Most of the dialogue delivery is left in Kay Kay's safe hands and usually that's a good thing. He starts out as his usual exceptional self. It's a delight to see his composure change from attentive-submissive when he's with his boss to bossy-smug when ordering around his subordinates. And then suddenly it gets weird. He delivers his lines in a staged way which I just couldn't associate with him - the distant look in the eyes while mouthing some really bad lines. Rukhsar (Sanjay's wife) looks very out-of-place all through. Her attire - the way the cotton sari is draped and the way she's carrying it don't go together at all. Her character's sub-plot has no connection with the rest of the story. I have this creeping suspicion that she's here because she was the only one ready to shed her clothes for that one unnecessary scene and fit the budget!! You'd think that it's a thriller and has given itself only 95 minutes so they'd be in a rush. But, na-ah...the camera takes its time to scan the room and the characters. Usually, I enjoy slow camerawork, it gives me time to soak in the atmosphere but here it is very random and rather directionless. Not to mention, the typical thriller-violin-shrieking in the background. I'd have voted for a tighter screenplay. And since it's a short film in the first place, maybe a few minutes to delve into the psyche of the other characters would have made my experience more complete.

Slow on pace, it fails to thrill. And despite the talented cast, this one is at best a plain and mediocre film.  ","A mysterious woman on a train coupled with mistaken identity of a tourist, definitely sounds interesting. Add to that inept cops and a clichéd gangster with his Russian henchmen, and you have The Tourist. The plot looks intriguing in the trailer, but turns out to be extremely stupid. It is very slow, and is only about dialogues. The story is just a pick up from any silly thriller.  It is mostly predictable, because nothing happens in the movie! The only value is a very talented cast and the cinematography.There are zero adrenaline moments. The amount of focus on Elise (Angelina Jolie) made me think this would turn out to be something like a Hitchcock movie. But it was below expectations, even with all the flair. 
I always wonder why the cops in such movies are so stupid, and this one just adds to my curiosity. People  standing around passively when pistols are shot, makes the entire thing look unreal. The lack of real twists weighs down hard on the film’s genre. Plus the physics of the action sequences are baffling. Almost all of them were unbelievable, and therefore irritating. And what should I say about the gangsters? Ah, losers.
I was looking forward to the film for Johnny Depp. But sadly, he has nothing substantial to do in the movie. He is comical, and does have his own charm. But I am so used to seeing him playing quirky, character driven parts, that it feels very odd to see him play a normal role. Angelina Jolie sure looks ravenous  - I mean ravishing. She pulls off her role as a confident woman who doesn’t like circumstances controlling her while manipulating a vulnerable tourist. Another thing I liked is that the film is not dark like other thrillers. The mood throughout the film is light, with a touch of comedy and a flicker of romance. The one-liners are enjoyable, though you'd have seen most of them in the trailer. Venice is made even prettier with the times of the day chosen to shoot her. Unhurried and verbose, the film is at the best mediocre. Jolie fans might like it since it has a lot of close-ups. Depp fans will find disappointment. Wait for a DVD if you really want to watch it. Else, you might as well give this one a pass.

But the film also has the capacity to alienate you with its overtly religious undertones and slow pace.","Terence Malick’s Palme D’or winner Tree of Lifedemarcates its audience into two – the kind that has the patience to watch a tree grow over the years and the kind that will keep coming back every 10 years to quickly monitor its progress. But both kinds acknowledge the magnificence of the tree.Tree of Life is a film that unfolds slowly. In all its passion, whispers, colors and surrealist imagery it tries to tell you the story of a family, and how they grapple with life and death. But it’s not a grim existential crisis, the movie talks about nature and about grace (personified by the father and mother, played by Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain.)The imagery is all-encompassing poetry. We pass through the life of a family living in an American suburb in the 50s, through the eyes of the younger son,  Jack (Sean Penn), who struggles to find answers for his brother’s death, his mother’s soft charm, his father’s disciplinarian demeanor and how that all cumulates into life.We bustle through old-school visuals with watercolors, smokes, liquids, paints and dyes – all of which take us through a symbolic, colorful and magnanimous process of how life originated. It’s a montage of  waterfalls, and erupting lava, amoebae forming, reproduction of every species and every aspect of nature scanned beautifully. The most refreshing twenty minutes in the film, mostly because the visuals are old-school and thankfully we aren’t subjected to high-end visual effects and graphics.We keep sifting through patient and extravagant shots of nature, of life in general and intercutting visuals of the O’Briens' lives. It’s a film about life, and it’s a preachy film but each shot manages to take your breath away. Coupled with the gospel like background score and divine cinematography, the audio-visual experience is almost sublime.However, the narrative structure is leisurely and repetitive; you feel like a slither of a water color, trickling down as slowly as possible, never stopping but moving sporadically. You’ll notice the religious undertones of redemption and forgiveness, you’ll see life through a supreme being’s eyes, but you’ll also zone out amidst all the lovely visuals because the film is basically like an extremely poetic sermon.

529,1229,1229,1229,1229,The Vow,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/the-vow-review/,,,,3.866666667,"The most clichéd bit of The Vow isn’t the lead pair, the plot or even the look of the film. It’s the background music – the piano interspersed with a part cheerful, part morose violin set. This immediately changes to a peppy pop song when the couple is all romantic and in love. If you learn to ignore this, and romance films are your thing – then The Vow will give you exactly that. However steer clear of the film if you’re looking for a rom-com; The Vow isn’t funny and you’d be better off watching 50 first dates instead. ","Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams look pretty darn good together. He’s handsome and manly, she’s petite and cute. You’ve won your battle by casting right in a romantic film – where the aim is for the audience to feel the love. It makes the job easier when the lead actors make a good looking pair. The Vow then is a love story between two fairly young individuals who find themselves in a bit of a spot. Everything seems romantically blissful for the newlyweds, Leo and Paige. They seem merrily in love, and their little parade of glee gets cut short when Paige loses her memory in a car accident. She doesn’t remember anything that happened in the last 5 years.On her part, McAdams does the whole confused bit pretty convincingly. Tatum is madly in love with his wife and through regular flashbacks we see the wonderfully romantic things he does for her – and you want to yank her out of her memory loss. But here’s the movie’s biggest problem: nothing is strong enough. The love becomes corny every now and then, no emotion (be it the horror of a memory loss, the frustration of a husband sharing an apartment with his stranger wife and so on) is established strong enough. Halfway through any portrayal, you already want to move onto to the main question the film poses: will she regain her memory?The Vow is based on a real-life incident involving Kim and Krickitt Carpenter, but it doesn’t really grip enough. The first few minutes of the film looks wonderfully bohemian, when we see Leo and Paige’s life. Her art studio with abstract clay cut outs, their apartment filled with color coordinated furniture in different shapes. But really, if that’s the one thing I remember warming my heart, the real hero of this film is production designer Kalina Ivanov.Unlike similarly plotted film, 50 First Dates, this film doesn’t have a comedy streak to fall back on. Or a goofy Adam Sandler. It could have been a fairly gripping film, with an interesting plot, if it steered clear of the regular cliché: love conquers all. Treated differently, perhaps the film could have focused on how Leo strives to make her fall back in love with him. On the contrary, The Vow leaves much to chance for the lead pair to realize their feelings for one another. Sure, it’s a well-behaved clean average film. If you’re in the mood for a cheesy weekend flick, The Vow delivers promptly. It could have been a crisp film; free from melodrama had the dialogues been given more attention, but with a good looking lead pair and a regular dose of love, this is your run-off-the-mill romance movie. If you’re into it, it gives you exactly what you want.

530,1230,1230,1230,1230,The Warrior's Way,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/warriors-way-review/,,4/5.0,,3.5333333330000003,"Ninjas Vs Ninjas - Cowboys Vs Cowboys - Ninjas Vs Cowboys! It sounds too good to be true, right? Well you got that right. It is a movie that sways between being a gory-action flick to a lough-out-loud comedy, and ends up being none. Even if you’re super-keen, save your money and wait for DVD. But the chances are, you’d like it even less on DVD as the only good thing about the movie is its cinematography.","The USP of The Warriors Way is gory action between Ninjas and Cowboys. With Cowboys and Aliens just around the corner, I thought all my prayers are about to be answered. For years, fans have been fantasizing about mixing two or more cults. Firefly and Cowboy Bebop are excellent examples of Space Cowboys and Blood - The Last vampire had Samurai vs Vampires. There are plenty more examples to cite - some lesser known than others. Now that Hollywood is experimenting by mixing things up, I was super-excited about The Warriors Way. I am extremely disappointed.The movie has all the tools to become a cult-blockbuster. It has an excellent cast in Dong-gun Jang (Korean superstar) as the rogue Ninja (also, the best swordsman in the history of mankind) and Geoffrey Rush as a reformed bandit (also, an ace-shooter of a cowboy). The film is produced by Barrie M. Osborne of The Lord Of The Rings franchise. Not much could have gone wrong. Correction: Not much ‘should’ have gone wrong. But a lot did. And the fault lies with the script by Sngmoo Lee and the screenplay. I can’t pick which is worse. The flashbacks come out of nowhere. The climate changes with every swing of the sword. It feels like they were really trying hard to make it a senseless flick.The first five minutes of the movie took away all the built-up excitement as they attempt to be humorous amidst gory action sequences. So you begin to think, okay its going to be one of those “From Dusk Till Dawn” (classic Cowboys vs Vampires) kind of movies. But then the movie becomes serious, and only manages to be unintentionally funny. Some of the action sequences are really well done though. I loved the last twenty minutes or so of the movie. I also loved the fact that the movements of Ninjas is quite close to those in animes (like Naruto). But visual perfection only makes up so much for everything else that’s just mediocre. You are still sitting through the shoddiest screenplay ever, and some pathetic acting by the supporting cast. Who doesn’t want to see Ninjas and Cowboys fight it out? So, I know you’re keen. But save your money, and wait for a DVD/TV release. Bonus: You can fast forward to the good parts and skip all the sad-drama in the middle.

531,1231,1231,1231,1231,The Wolf of Wall Street,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/wolf-wall-street-review/,,,,3.5333333330000003,"Martin Scorsese shows the world how it's done, once again. A crazy ride of questionable morals, The Wolf of Wall Street shows us the escapades of a greedy libertine in a manner that makes you see through your own righteousness. Entertaining, hilarious and downright vulgar, Scorsese at the helm and DiCaprio's turn as the titular character make for quite a film. ","We live rather tame lives, if you really think about it. Years of conditioning about what's right and what's wrong; the pangs of guilt or, alternatively, the adrenaline rush one gets when one crosses a moral 'line'; passing moral judgements about the other; penance for one's 'sins'; the works. Humanity lives by a code of ethics that, at least for the most part, seems to work for us.  But then, who really writes this 'code'? Who makes the rules, and if we go by the fundamental premise that all of humankind is equal, then who's to say what defines right and wrong in the first place? After all, one man's food is another man's poison. Consequently, there will always be those who live life by their own rules, all notions of morality be damned. These people, usually, are the ones who aren't accountable for their Aston Martins.Enter Jordan Belfort - Wall Street stockbroker and salesman extraordinaire - a man who made millions by laundering fraudulent stocks to unsuspecting investors. A self-styled Robin Hood who took wealth from the rich and gave it to... Himself! A man who made so much money that he didn't mind throwing cash in the trash, just for kicks.Based on the book 'The Wolf of Wall Street' written by the real life Belfort himself, Martin Scorsese's film adaptation of the scamster's life is an astonishingly audacious piece of cinema - both in content as well as execution. With the film largely based on fact, one can't help but be overwhelmed by just how obscene Belfort's greed, depravity, lasciviousness and lust for money was; and that lust just grew bigger with each additional million he made. Jordan Belfort didn't just push the limits of morality, he ignored them completely, seeming to live in an alternate dimension where morality as a concept just didn't exist.Then there's what Martin Scorsese has done with Belfort's story. Call it glorification, call it treating a serious issue with a far lighter tone than can be considered appropriate, or call it sheer masterclass in adopting a cinematic style that will work best with the written word - either way, Scorsese knocks this one out of the park the way only he can.Directed with a kind of fervent energy that one hasn't seen from the great man in a while, The Wolf of Wall Street is cinema on crack. Outrageously funny, incredibly daring in terms of how it never shies away from going deeper and deeper into the realms of 'immorality', briskly paced to the extent that one never realizes its monstrous runtime, and phenomenally performed to boot, The Wolf of Wall Street will either be the most fun you've had at the cinemas in a while, or if the vulgarity of Belfort's excesses begin to get to you, it can also be the most taxing experience in recent times.Because make no mistake, neither Martin Scorsese nor his terrific cast have held themselves back with this one; they've gone all out to bring you characters that make you question everything you believe in. Sex, violence, drugs, language, corruption, immorality and everything considered taboo are actually celebrated with uncontrolled licentiousness in the film. In fact, despite the fact that the film has been released in India with a good six minutes chopped off, I still couldn't help wonder how the censors were mature enough to let the film release at all - not that I'm complaining. It is rated as an adult film, obviously, but I know for a fact that even many 'adults' will find it hard to stomach the level of all-round immodest extravagance of sin that has been depicted in the film.Of the cast, Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort and Jonah Hill as his aide Donnie give their characters their unbridled all. DiCaprio, in particular, must be saluted for pumping Belfort with a quality that makes him seem 'normal', despite his excesses. They should be someone we despise, but we are never allowed to take a moral stance with them. DiCaprio - and Scorsese, of course, - make you an unsuspecting participant in everything that you would ideally consider 'wrong', which consequently shakes you off from your own moral high ground, bringing your self-righteousness crashing down.Questions will be asked, of course. Is it right to glorify something that is so obviously 'wrong'? Should there have been a stronger focus on highlighting that sin must always be atoned for; that karma will come back to bite you in the backside some day? Is a film like The Wolf of Wall Street irresponsible towards society, because it seems to make heroes out of people who should be considered as villains? These are all points of view, which, while important to talk about, actually are a disservice to the intent of the film altogether. Because, whether we like it or not, the world is very clearly run by all the Belforts out there - the ones who are 'more equal' than the others. Scorsese daringly shows us that even these people are human, and by making an enjoyable film out of Belfort's story, he shows us that if we were in Jordan Belfort's shoes, we would probably have been no different. We're all, in some way or the other, wolves in human clothing.

532,1232,1232,1232,1232,The Wolverine,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/wolverine-review/,,5/5.0,,3.866666667,"Hugh Jackman returns as The Wolverine, and he is one of the key reasons why the film made for a better watch than I expected it to be. Simply by holding back on action sequences and focusing more on character, director James Mangold has made a film that just seems different from the typical films of this genre.","No matter how strong or how fast you get, you just can’t outrun your own inner demons. And Logan has stranger, darker demons, and for far longer to boot, than most other people – if you can classify him under ‘people’, that is. The brooding, sombre mutant is back, and he’s still being haunted by the ghosts of his past.Despite Logan being, by some distance, my personal favourite character from the X-Men series, I must confess that I didn’t have too many expectations from The Wolverine, because there have been far too many X-Men films coming out far too soon, than the world strictly requires. Besides, a few years back, director James Mangold managed to do the impossible by making the first and only Tom Cruise film I dislike, in Knight and Day. I’m unsure, then, if it was my low expectations or the fact that it actually is a film with its own merit, but I quite enjoyed The Wolverine. For one, it has far lesser action than one has come to expect from an X-Men film, or indeed, a film based on any Marvel/DC character or world. The film focuses more on Logan, the character - a mutant whose gravest problems stem from deep within – from his past, his present and his seemingly perpetual future. With the film being set in Japan – mostly in Tokyo, before moving to the outskirts, The Wolverine also has a flavour of Japan that is undoubtedly superficial, but one that works in its favour. Capturing the flavour of a country or city that has its own distinctive culture is largely unexplored territory for a Hollywood film of this genre, and it thus makes for a refreshing change in this film.Indeed, the entire narrative of The Wolverine took me slightly aback with how much it focused on the character and his surroundings, rather on VFX-powered set pieces. The few of the latter that are there in the film are quite well executed as well, without bordering on action-porn, as films tend to do these days. Watch out, particularly, for an imaginative and riveting scene on the top of a thundering ‘Shinkansen’ – what is ubiquitously known as a Bullet train – again, something quite typical of Japan.It helps, of course, to have the towering presence of someone like Hugh Jackman to hold the film together. After Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, Jackman is the only other actor to have a made a comic book character so much his own that it’s hard to imagine anyone else playing it. Also, after watching his incredible turn as Jean Valjean in last year’s Les Misérables, my respect for him as an actor increased tremendously, and his intensity shines through in The Wolverine as well. Every performance around Jackman, though, is so stilted and effected that it jars. The pace of the narrative isn’t breakneck, and yet the film never pauses and lingers around pointlessly either. The runtime of just over two hours thus seems about perfect. To round it off, the film also looks good – despite a bleak, de-saturated colour tone, it makes generous use of solar flares, which always seem to improve the look of even an averagely shot film. The film has a wider 3D release than 2D, so it’s more likely that you’ll end up watching a 3D show. The 3D isn’t particularly great, but it doesn’t hamper the film either. Of course, there is the post-credits scene to look forward to as well, an intriguing little teaser for Bryan Singer’s X-Men: Days of Future Past, which is summer 2014’s big release. So, if you’re absolutely fed up of big franchise films that OD on VFX and action, then you could give The Wolverine a shot – it is a wee bit different from the usual. If nothing else, Logan - and Hugh Jackman - almost adamantly keep things interesting.

533,1233,1233,1233,1233,The Woman In Black,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/the-woman-in-black-review/,,3/5.0,,3.2,"It’s not a good thing if you spend most of the first half of the film thinking, Harry Potter is the protagonist of the film. Well, Harry Potter in a Victorian suit. Anyhow, The Woman in Black will distract you from its poor choices (casting Danielle Radcliffe primarily) with it’s well formulated horror sequences and thrilling visuals. Brace yourself. ","The Woman in Black, simplistic as the title is, will haunt you for a couple of minutes after you walk out of the theatre. That’s a sign of a successful horror film, some would say. The film reminds you of the 1960s horror films (the production house Hammer Films have quite the success run), with elaborate production design, familiar horror tropes and a plot that one can’t go wrong with, but in spite of spooking you successfully, there are quite a few bones one can pick. However, if horror is what you went in looking for, unadulterated horror is what you will get.Adapted from Susan Hill’s novel of the same name, The Woman in Black is set in the Victorian era where young attorney Arthur Kipps (Danielle Radclife) has to be sent to North England to sell a (haunted) house that is so cut away from the village, it can only be reached by a long marshy causeway that is covered by the sea during high tide. Arthur’s job is to revisit the house for the original occupant’s missing documents.Local legend has it that the house is haunted by a woman who mourns the death of her child, something the villagers did nothing to stop. Arthur realizes this could be the reason for the number of children dying in the village. He goes ahead with his job, despite of multiple warnings from the locals. We are introduced to his financial burden in the beginning, and even though that could be reason enough to go into a haunted house, Radcliffedoes a decent job in selling his curiosity to us, about the house and its story. It’s the idea that he is married man with a kid that doesn’t go down too well. You keep trying to understand, why they would cast Radcliffe for this part – was there a dearth of actors who looked 30 plus? Because Radcliffe most certainly does not. He also has that perennial expression on his face – the same kind that Harry Potter carried in his movies at every moment of looming danger. Minus points for repetitive acting and disbelief there.Having said that, the film’s production design reminds you of homes that genuinely give you the creeps – the kind of haunted houses that needn’t do much, while it’s play with light, shadows, rocking chairs and wound-up toys are enough to creep you out. In that sense The Woman in Black relies on old-school horror tricks, with creaking staircases, random glimpses of half-decomposed ghosts in black, doors shutting tight on their own. We could thank The Woman in Black for reminding us that we can get spooked by the simplest things. A good amount of spine-chilling visuals also add to your entire horror film experience. Cameraperson Tim Maurice-Jones knows what he needs to get the entire picture together – aerial shots of a misty sea in pure grey hues, shadowed forest trees and their play with light and your regular minimalistic piano for background music - and you’re gearing yourself for 95 minutes of periodic covering your eyes and jumping off your seat.

534,1234,1234,1234,1234,The World Before Her,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/tore-herhe-world-her-review/,,,,3.2,"Nisha Pahuja’s The World Before Her will make you uncomfortable, it will urge you to question what you know and believe, and it will shame you for being a part of a society that doesn’t fundamentally understand that men and women are equal; that such a question being raised itself is a mark of how undeserving humanity is of the world it inhabits.","Who decided that a woman must fight to prove herself worthy of existence? When was it decreed that women are, in any way at all, inferior to men; that their lives mean only to be daughters, wives and mothers? Why is that even today, in a world that has seen humankind create unbelievable miracles – so many of them by women – we still have to ‘reserve’ places for women in government or in other organizations? Why is it that even urban, educated India has different standards for men and women?I must have been all of 5, maybe less, when I first heard the ‘saying’ that behind every successful man there is a woman. It rankled back then, and it still does. We’ve all seen, over the years, how women are the ones blamed for ‘degrading  our culture’, chastised for ‘stepping out of their boundaries’, questioned for possessing ambition, and even physically attacked for ‘embracing Westernization’. If all of this sickens you, then Nisha Pahuja’s documentary, The World Before Her, will hit you in the gut. It hurts like few other films in the recent past.There are two extremes in India – the modern, urban, high-flying but often ugly world of unbridled personal ambition; and the traditional, conservative, fiercely insecure India that guards its past far more than it welcomes the future. The World Before Her juxtaposes the two, with the most objective possible view of the place of women in both worlds. Ruhi is a girl barely out of her teens, from semi-urban India; a girl who aims to make it big at the Miss India pageant. Prachi, on the other hand, is a young instructor at Durga Vahini, the women’s wing of Vishwa Hindu Parishad – the self-appointed custodians of Hinduism (or Hindutva, as they’d prefer to call it.)As we take a look at Ruhi’s journey – which represents that of so many like her – at the unforgiving, relentless training they have to undergo at beauty pageants, you can’t help but feel sorry for the fact that so much of a woman’s self-worth is determined by her external appearance. True, there are pageants for men as well, but they rarely ever claim the spotlight the way a beauty pageant for women does. So strange that a society so unashamedly patriarchal finds a competition that pits women against each other on the basis of their looks far more appealing than one for men.Prachi’s tale, on the other hand, scares you. Here is a girl who is thankful to her parents for letting her live despite being born a girl, because of which she willingly embraces harsh, physical punishments from her father; a girl who derives an almost perverse pleasure because of her power and domination over the young girls, many of them teenagers, who she trains at the Durga Vahini camps. There are times when these camps almost feel like militant training camps; their acceptance and belief in violence as a solution against the enemies of Hinduism – the big monotheistic religions of the world, Western culture and the likes.Most people will find sympathy in at least one of these faces of India. The ones who fall in the middle, those who feel uncomfortable by the questions that can be asked of both these schools of thought, are the ones who will be most affected by the film. Both these worlds, though starkly different from each other, find parallels in each other as well. Diction expert Sabira Merchant, who trains Miss India contestants on the way they speak during the preparation rounds for the pageant, refers to the pageants as ‘factories’, which churn out polished, modern Indian women. The Durga Vahini camps are also like factories, spawning hordes of women who can raise fight if the time calls for it. Both worlds have precise routines, specific methods and a rigid structure that participants just can’t break free of. While Ruhi, Prachi and the other girls we come across in the film are representative of the journeys that women like them follow, they also become characters we invest in. It is hard to miss the moistening of Ruhi’s eyes when she talks about her dream of becoming Miss India and making her parents proud. It is extremely difficult to not view Prachi with a mix of apprehension and sympathy, when she talks about how she hates girls who are too ‘girlish’. And do look closely at Ruhi’s face and the subtle changes you see in it as the film progresses – you’ll see how her Miss India preparation took a biologically-induced toll on her beautifully flawed natural face as well.Interestingly, the documentary is almost crafted like a thriller. It switches between the two worlds smoothly, and as it goes on, you’re almost holding your breath, wondering what happens of the women we meet in the film. You wait to see where their respective journeys lead them; and as the two paths merge into each other, you’re left stunned, but with nagging questions that will haunt you. Almost like how children, when looking at a television, wonder if they’re looking at people in a world inside a box, or if the people inside the box are looking at them and at the world outside.The film restricts itself to the way women are perceived in the two contrasting worlds, but if you think about it, it also questions the two worlds itself. Which is the real India? Is ‘Western culture’ a threat to our own rich heritage? Or is culture a dynamic and evolving construct that has no option but to change as time passes? How is it that a woman can stand before a massive audience comprised of other women, and fiercely speak of how a woman isn’t supposed to think of a ‘career’? On the other hand, in the so-called modern, liberal world of the pageants, the women are taught how to stand, walk, talk and twirl. Their legs are supposed to be a certain way, their chins are supposed to be a certain way. Fingers, toes, wrist, neck - everything has a fixed position to project confidence and personality. Doesn't sound so liberal now, does it?Another terrifying thought you take from the film is just how communally charged a country India is. Day-to-day life might seem peaceful, but that there literally are armies being trained by the majority community in the country is scary. It makes you wonder if the minorities have similar notions and ideas. All of this is simmering below a facade of relative harmony. When it will explode is anybody's guess.The World Before Her is the kind of film that you can write and talk about for longer than you can imagine. Hence, it is also an important film; the discomfort which it engenders being a measure of which face you represent, of the ugly world we live in.

No such luck.Oh wait, Himesh Reshammiya's character Ravi is so obnoxious that it is amusing, till he gets annoying. But, till then, I was in awe of the person who thought of such an arrogant style for the protagonist. So, I am not rooting for the character, who is supposedly mean for the good. I don't care who he falls in love with and what he is willing to do for her. Considering it is a murder mystery, you'd think you are made to care about the victim. But, you are asked, neigh begged, to judge her negatively from the first frame she shows up in. And when the big ""expose"" happens, you don't care either. Sure, the writer has tried hard to make it a huge reveal, but it just doesn't matter enough. In addition, it goes overboard in increasing the tension. Yes, additional drama in terms of slo-mo scenes and dramatic background score. But, also story-wise it goes says more than once, ""not over yet, there's more.""The performances are as perfunctory as they can get. To rub salt into the wound, you have Irrfan Khan doing a voiceover. The setting of the 70s doesn't work at all. The songs, well has either, Yo Yo Honey Singh or Himesh Reshammiya as their singer. So, there's no looking for respite there. The sliver lining is - it is a short film. And that it has come out on a day where people are generally, likely to care about it even less than usual - let alone read its review.

Through subtle humour and fast-paced plot changes, it challenges your idea of stability and chaos and gears you up to face the worst. A must-watch for someone who needs motivation to just get up!","We all have aspirations of how to deal with a mid-life crisis: Red/yellow sport cars, travel to an exotic location and the works. Maybe change career paths; follow our dreams – anything that works. Shah Rukh Khan does it, with every “guest appearance” or “endorsement” while Kevin Spacey’s character in American Beauty is a benchmark of what we shouldn’t do. What do you do however, when you face an intense identity crisis at 40?Helen Hunt’s Then She Found Me  is a quirky, modernist take on a mid-life crisis of a woman who finds her biological mother at the age of 40 and her life changes. Then She Found Me  is Hunt’s debut as a director.Through the confusions and the chaos, Miss Epner (Hunt) dabbles with a mother, and a rather loud and famous one at that, a spineless ex-husband, a new relationship and a life-changing identity crisis.Then She Found Me  is one of those films where nothing really ground breaking happens, but you get hooked onto the story as it unfolds one stupendously crazy incident after another. Just when you get used to shocking revelations like finding a mother at 40 and getting dumped when least expected, a voice-over trails you through a much larger catastrophe. Funnily enough, you’re never made to sit and grieve anything. The entire tone of the film can be watered down to one sentence – “Okay Life, how much worse can this get?” And there’s never a boundary to that! One after another, we are made to spiral down incident after incident of turbulent discoveries and funny connections, until we reach a point where it all binds to give sense of closure. Closure is the ideal end to a film like this – because it satiates you, as viewer after taking a crazy adventure ride that the film is.The look and feel of Then She Found Me  is contemporary, satirical and subtly funny in a way that makes your Laugh Out Loud in your head, but never burst out laughing for real. It’s a different brand of funny, coupled with a smooth background score and interesting, intercutting cinematography – all which makes sense when coupled with the scene in question.The DVD of Then She Found Me   isn’t a goldmine though, with just a few trailers, extended scenes and a interview with Helen Hunt on her first time as a director and her experience of writing the film. The interview is a decent watch while Hunt talks about her choice of this script for her debut film, and how it uses understated humour to define a state of mind. Then She Found Me  is an underdog. We all want a raving DVD collection with films we can boast about – if the films are unheard of, even better. This film isn’t something you can boast about, or even use as a conversation catalyst in intellectual discussion about art & cinema but you’ll finish the film with a genuine smile on your face hoping you have the nerve to live through your mid-life crisis in a similar manner.

The film has a few funny moments, but the action in the film is drab and can be done away with. Watch it if you have the interest for some puerile entertainment, but be warned. ","Romantic-Action-Comedy to me only sounded like a mash. So when I heard, that was genre of McG’s next film (director of the Charlie’s Angels series) This Means War, I was worried. Two things could have happened here: this film could go the same way that most frivolous films go with really good actors. Case in point: No Strings Attached with Natalie Portman right after Black Swan. Nobody can really deduce why serious actors chose to make this genre jump. Or one could also expect actors like Reese Witherspoon and Tom Hardy to salvage the film.This Means War has an aftertaste of the Charlie’s Angels films and a bit of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Chris Pine and Tom Hardy are CIA agents (and best friends) who happen to fall for the same girl, Lauren (Witherspoon).Let's ignore for a moment that  Pine and  Hardy look nothing like CIA agents, what with male-model type looks and the swanky apartments they live in. As compensation you'd expect some distracting entertainment on their part. But apart from a sprinkling of witty banter, every bit of one-upmanship that they indulge in is borderline creepy and voyeuristic because of the way it's done - unlike the secretive and swift demeanor in which CIA agents act (or what popular culture would have us believe. However, the film does pick up pace in bits, picking comic elements in their fight for love and the leading men are rather adorable in their ""May the best spy win"" rut.Lauren ofcourse, is unaware and rather cute in a regular Reese Witherspoon way (see: Legally Blonde). You would think since she’s done many rom-coms, Witherspoon would be able to breeze through this role, but for some reason all three actors perform extremely laboriously. The worst of the lot is Tom Hardy, who is a bad casting option for this film. I found myself regularly zoning out, and making callous references to his better films (Warrior, Inception). The film also has a real villain, Heinrich (Til Schweiger), who seems rather inconsequential in the larger scheme of things. The film categorically revolves around a glorifying set of sequences where Pine and Hardy fight it out for the lady. The action sequences are loud, and by virtue of that it does catch your attention. But in retrospect, they are also very plain and rely on the sound design to jolt you as opposed to the visuals. Having offered a critique though, I think it’s only fair to inform you that the kids who had come to watch the movie were having a ball. Evidently the humor in the film was relatable to them and there were moments when, due to sheer peer pressure, I did laugh out loud. There are some funny moments and punch dialogues (and really, that much can be expected with a bunch of good actors in the film). This Means War is not as sassy and fun as the first Charlie’s Angels movie was, but it’s not a waste of your time either. You might just enjoy yourself.

This Is It is a film about what could have been. From March through his untimely and unexpected death in June, Michael Jackson and his crew were busy preparing for what would have been his comeback concerts (after 10 years) at London’s O2 arena. What followed, in the approximate two hours of the movie, was a glimpse of what went on during those rehearsals. It would have amazed the audience had it really been it. This Is It is not a documentary. It is more about his music, his performance. There were fireworks, aerial dancers, majestic costumes, astonishing visual effects and incredible choreography all set to Michael’s classics like “Billie Jean”, “Black or White”, “The Way You Make Me Feel” and “Thriller”. It was very enlightening to see the young dancers he'd chosen to go on tour with him look into the camera with tears in their eyes and thank him and describe how he'd changed their worlds before they'd ever even met him. It made me wonder if they were interviewed after his death. The production notes said that the movie was made from over 100 hours of rehearsal footage and I doubt it because it appeared that those were rehearsals for a handful of different days, judging from Michael’s clothes.  And I hope that it's true that Michael really was saving up his energy and voice for the actual concerts as he said in the movie, because even though he sounded and moved superbly for a 50-year-old, he looked tired and frail in some of the sequences. As the movie went deeper, so did the nostalgic feelings in me. I was just 9 years old when Michael had toured India as a part of HIStory world tour and I would be elated when MTV would become MJTV for some hours, playing only his numbers, as a part of the tour’s promotion. “They don’t care about us” evoked in me the breathtaking performance of the same number in Mumbai in 1997.  But throughout the melodious documentary, there was a melancholic, uneasy sentiment lurking. After wrecking my brains for long, it hit me. What was missing was the audience. We were all used to seeing Jackson’s concerts with the spectators going wild in hysteria. Girls sobbing uncontrollably, people fainting. That used to be the magic, the madness of Michael Jackson’s concerts. All that and more was absent in the rehearsal footages. And it made me feel sad. It somehow coupled with the fall of the artist over the years owing to his eccentricities and finally his death. “This Is It” facilitated a highly nostalgic farewell to the world of a glorious artiste. It was a splendid souvenir for genuine fans of the late king of pop. And I would be an optimist here and refuse to believe that this was created for purely monetary purposes. 
RIP, Michael.

539,1239,1239,1239,1239,Thor: The Dark World,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review3 Reader Reviews 2/5.0,/movie/thor-dark-world-review/,,2/5.0,,1.9,"An underwhelming sequel to the first film, Thor: The Dark World, directed by Alan Taylor, can only be watched because Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston are good fun as Thor and Loki. Otherwise, the film isn’t much more than a carrot to keep audiences happy till 2015’s Avengers film.","For a film of the scale and setting of Thor: The Dark World, what really makes or breaks it is how much you’re invested, not in the hero, but in the villain of the enterprise, and what grandiose plans he has to unleash his evil on the world. Among the many factors that make the sequel to Thor a bit of a drag, the one at the forefront is the fact that the grand calamity that threatens to befall the universe is such a convoluted mess that you don’t really care whether it happens or not.Like Iron Man 3, this film too picks up from where last year’s The Avengers ended. Thor and Loki are back on their home planet Asgard, under the reign of their father Odin. Loki, of course, is thrown into prison for his mischief of the previous films. Meanwhile, in another corner of the universe, evil is brewing in the form of Malekith, leader of a race known as the Dark Elves.While Thor: The Dark World falls right into the series of standalone films of the characters from The Avengers in terms of sheer magnitude, the film suffers because it just doesn’t interest you enough. Sure, it has the set pieces, the visual quality and a couple of characters – Thor and Loki, namely – who manage to keep you interested when they’re around. But in terms of plot, The Dark World can only be described as underwhelming and ineffective. What’s surprising is that unlike the Iron Man and Captain America films, which at the very least seem to be getting bigger and better with each subsequent release, Thor: The Dark World isn’t even nearly as much plain old fun like 2011’s Thor was. Sure, the VFX looks grander and the overall dimensions of the film are aimed at making your jaw drop; but it rarely succeeds in doing so, because the narrative of the film is yawn-inducing at best.Also, director Alan Taylor, who was roped in for the sequel doesn’t quite seem to have a hold on his characters and the story the way Kenneth Branagh, who directed the first installment, did. In fact, one sorely misses some of the elegant close-ups of the previous film, which spoke so much in the most minimalist manner. Expectedly, Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston as Thor and Loki respectively, are the only real saving graces of the film. Hiddleston, in particular, has such a magnetic screen presence and gets the best lines – and the most interesting character graph – in the film. While Natalie Portman as Thor’s lady love Jane Foster looks gorgeous, she is saddled with a role not nearly worthy of her. Also, when filmmakers will stop giving us dumb-blonde-meets-physics-genius type female characters is anybody’s guess. As for Anthony Hopkins as Odin, the less said the better. Obviously, then, the most important part that this new Thor film plays is keeping us occupied while we wait, first, for next year’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and then 2015’s big one – The Avengers: Age of Ultron. Thor: The Dark World has a tiny cameo by another Avenger and an interesting-enough mid-credits tidbit in the end to make fanboys and fangirls salivate at the prospect of Joss Whedon’s next Avengers extravaganza. Until then, there’s only so much that this film can do.

Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s Three Monkeys is a work of art, literally. Winner of Best Director at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival and nominee for the Golden Palm, this Turkish film needs patience, curiosity and some maturity to sit through. I’d still say it’s a must watch for what the film turns out to be. A tip: Make sure you’re not stressed out or drowsy before the film begins.","A viewer’s state of mind is of utmost importance while watching a film. Drowsiness, exhaustion and fidgety company, are three factors that strongly influence opinion about a film. Their absence can make you feel that Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s Three Monkeys is a masterpiece, and their abundance can put you to sleep. Indeed, Three Monkeys qualifies as the film institute specimen. Watch it on fast forward (not even 2x, try 4x) and you’ll still know exactly what’s happening. But if you really want to feel the film, and be part of the nervous tension flowing between the characters, you’ve got to sit through. I did - the first time I saw it on the big screen - and I was almost in a trance, absorbed deeply into the proceedings, however slow one might call them. The director, an accomplished still photographer himself, has such a fantastic command over the visuals that despite few dialogues, the emotions are loud and clear. The plot is simple - an aspiring politician Servet (Ercan Kesal) accidentally hits a pedestrian while driving along the highway on a rainy night. To shield his future in politics, he asks his employee Eyup (Yavuz Bingol) to take the blame and go to prison for six months. In return he promises to pay him a handsome compensation on return, in addition to his monthly salary to Eyup’s family - Hacer (Hatice Aslan), wife, and son Ismail (Rifat Sungar). Servet, however, fancies Hacer and when she approaches him for the full compensation and it triggers an affair that soon snowballs into a web of lies between each of characters. It is from here on that each of them becomes one of the three monkeys, who see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil. The last 30 minutes of the film are perhaps the least verbose, but despite being so, Ceylan’s direction has enough drama to convey each character’s state of denial, conflict, jealousy and revenge. The film also makes some points to ponder over. It becomes clear that evil is never washed out completely - it can only be passed on. The miseries of one person, go on to the become the miseries of another. Money, lust and innocence are just pawns in the process. Ceylan makes use of static shots and long, disturbing silences which create a nervous tension flowing throughout the film. Emotions are rarely explicitly stated in the film, they’re left to the viewer’s interpretation. 
Although there’s almost no background music in the film, the use of a simple ringtone on Hacer’s phone - a Turkish song about love, loss and hurt - is used very cleverly to establish emotions. The cinematography is stunning - shot in HD, each frame seems like a work of art. There is a meticulous amount of detailing that goes in showing the effects of the Turkish summer on each character - perspiration, sweat and secrets become conniving bedfellows in the film. And the arrival of the monsoon, marks the passing away of evil.Three Monkeys is art-house cinema at its best. Watch it with some patience and focus. You won’t be disappointed. It tells a good story with a lot of substance. And by being minimalist with dialogues, it proves successfully that silence can be louder than words.

Even India and Pakistan can save the world. Especially since Tiger is alive. The regular action fare – nothing more than you expect but nothing less either. ,"You don’t expect subtlety and you don’t get it. There is no humility here, Tiger Zinda Hai is about how Tiger aka Salman Khan attempts to save hostages, kill villains, love his family all while he patches up the relationship between India and Pakistan to promote world peace. When you go in wanting that, you walk out smiling because you knew exactly what was going to happen. In that sense, Tiger Zinda Hai is satisfying. Else, it is pretty much mundane.Salman Khan is himself and the rest are just props around him, including Katrina Kaif. Sure, she gets to throw a few kicks around and is quite slick about it too. But, ultimately Tiger Zinda Hai wears the Salman card so much on its sleeve that you don’t even want to spend energy in thinking, “Hey but, how did that happen?”In fact, the most apparent show of cashing in on Salmania is that he is given some of the lamest lines ever. It is like the writers know that it doesn’t matter what he says, as long as he has the quintessential swagger about it - almost willingly mocking the fans. Especially when the lyricist has come up with decent lines like, “narazgi kagzi teri”1 or “Swag se karenge sabka swagat”2, you wonder why some of it couldn’t have seen its way to the dialogue.The story does have the villain and the hero outsmart each other constantly but that comes across as going through the drill. The addition of humour and patriotism also look like adding salt and pepper to bring flavour rather than being germane to a plot. Very conveniently the motivation of the covert operation moves from saving lives to national pride to world peace to saving lives to national pride to world peace. The humour is not in the jokes or situations as much as it is from the ridiculous concepts. The world’s most romantic 8-year old who is also the hero’s “I don’t care how you do it, just do it” boss, the national spy who also knows how to paint portraits on snow, the number of empty cars blown up, the amount of time the villain gang waits to shoot while the hero’s team does a panorama sweep with a machine gun – bring smirks rather than smiles. Amidst this though, the biggest positive is that songs don’t interrupt the proceedings. To that extent things are taken seriously. Of course, the background music more than compensates by abruptly alternating between a romantic tune that is tempered down to be sad as required and a pulsating, thriller, Bond-esque tune. Clearly, they aren’t experimenting much with the genre by keeping it plain, simple and in line with expectations. They do tread into the controversial territory of preaching sisterhood between India and Pakistan. While it is a noble thought with a lot of merit but the oversimplification fictionalises it a bit much. 1Your resentment is only on paper

If you revere it already, you are sure to fall in love once again, whatever be the rating. But if you enjoyed the original and are now anticipating narrative extravaganza, you have good reason to shun the latest offering. As is the case with every sequel, comparisons with the first film seem highly inevitable. But as I said, it’s hardly a matter of concern for this film’s target audience. Unlike the first one, Timepass 2 literally stays true to its name and is sadly intended to do only that much.This film doesn’t believe in complexities or rationalities. All that counts here is quick one-liners at the expense of emotional connect. This is the single largest factor that differentiates the two films. Never-ending humour is indeed a trump card in Timepass. But it is the impressive script that embellishes the wittiness, paying rich dividends. The characters’ candour represses their implausible behaviour. Though it’s unfair to trash something merely based on its past successes, Timepass 2 doesn’t even excel as a standalone film. And this has nothing to do with the pre-release hype surrounding it.The pressure on Ravi Jadhav to match (if not outdo) the charm of Timepass is understandably nerve-wracking. But this cannot justify his motives to play safe this time. The open-ended nature of the love story between Dagadu (Prathmesh Parab) and Prajakta (Ketaki Mategoankar) in Timepass gives birth to Timepass 2.  After passage of years, Priyadarshan Jadhav now essays Dagadu, while Priya Bapat plays Prajakta. However, Jadhav doesn’t want you to forget the erstwhile cast. The younger actors drop in at crucial junctures to appease you.This move works until it backfires. It’s hard to come to terms with the illusion of Parab compelling Priyadarshan to make decisive moves every now and then. Let alone the logic or lack thereof, it gets annoying subsequently.They weave rib-tickling words around a shallow framework and superficial conflicts, expecting to (re)create magic.Logical discontinuity, unconvincing explanations and informative dialogue are all over the place. But the truth is, nobody bothers. Jadhav himself is as negligent as its mere-fun-seeking audience. Each film’s treatment differs subject to its content. But it’s appalling to see the man, known for his intellectual flicks, now spoon-feeding concepts/events mechanically. Albeit it’s hard to escape his midas touch for a bit in Timepass 2, it is easily forgettable.Manmeet Pem’s younger Balbharti is by far the most adoring character in Timepass. And it had many strong characters to root for. So, it gets really tough for Timepass 2 to pull that charisma off even in older avatars. To my dismay, the sequel doesn’t have even one such character. Sandeep Pathak’s Malaria, to a certain level, leaves you in splits more often with his actions than words. But the magic is still missing.It isn't visually tempting either. Vasu Rane’s miserable form continues after Baji. Several amateurishly-lit spaces and picturisation style subvert the sensation set in its original.About an adolescent love, Timepass stands as a mature effort. It’s enjoyable regardless of its weaknesses. Timepass 2 is more or less an immature and outdated attempt at grown-up love. Sure, it will set new Box Office records. But is money the only measure of quality? I hope it’s not.

They can never match up to Hollywood.” Such people seem to enjoy bangs, booms and style - a staple of Hollywood films, particularly espionage thrillers. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is probably not for them. It isn’t for someone who is looking to be on the edge of their seat without being willing to invest themselves mentally and emotionally into the film-watching experience.  Tinker Tailor is a film that can be appreciated at multiple levels. The wonderful mood that the film manages to create (in keeping with what international espionage in real life must probably be like); the measured pace with which the multitude of layers of the plot are revealed, the wonderful performances by an ensemble cast of British actors; and most importantly, at least for me, the satisfied yet incomplete feeling of wanting to be involved with the experience just a little longer, even after the lights are back.The film primarily deals with the British MI6’s search for a mole within their ranks. Gary Oldman plays George Smiley, a veteran intelligence man who is entrusted with this task. Set mostly in London in the 1970s, the pace of the film is slow, like a teabag kept in lukewarm water, left to brew by itself.The film is mostly shot in telephoto lenses, making the viewer feel like he is spying on the character through binoculars - distant yet desperately trying to be involved with them. This is doubtlessly intentional, considering the espionage theme. Concurrently, the colour palette is bleak and pale. Nothing stands out visually, perhaps because nothing is what it seems. Director Tomas Alfredson’s sensibilities are clearly European, but that is stating the obvious, considering where he is from. Gary Oldman anchors the film with his performance. There are few actors in the world like him simply because every performance of his is a masterclass in how to be the character. Colin Firth is marvelous as Bill Haydon. My current favourite actor, Tom Hardy, brings raw intensity to his character of Ricki Tarr, an agent in hiding. John Hurt and Benedict Cumberbatch amongst others lend noteworthy support.The film is far from perfect, particularly in its writing. The screenplay of the film, as mentioned earlier, takes it time to unfold. There were also some portions that were quite ambiguous, to the point that it would perhaps need another viewing to fully comprehend. Even then, the nervous-but-never-high-voltage tension that the gently unfolding events created was something that I savoured through the film.Thrillers with an international backdrop seem to be the flavor of the season, what with M:I – 4, Don 2 and Sherlock Holmes seeing releases in successive weeks. This film is a far cry from the films mentioned above in almost every aspect that they can be compared in. Perhaps that was why Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy worked for me. I enjoyed some of the others, but this one stayed with me far longer.A word of caution though - while Tinker Tailor can prove to be an immersive experience for some, I suspect that it won’t appeal to a majority of the audience. It is the kind of film I would recommend to someone only after I spend an hour with them to figure out their taste in cinema.

544,1244,1244,1244,1244,Titanic 3D,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review6 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/titanic-3d-review/,,4/5.0,,3.6,Titanic is an epic film – much like ET and Casablanca for their respective generations. So many people have told me how it’s one of the first English films they’ve watched in a movie theatre – also one of the only English films that they would gladly sit through (all 3 and half hours of it). I realized Titanic’s popularity when my domestic help mentioned she’d seen the film in Hindi on cable TV on a Saturday night and loved it. It’s a film we’ve all loved at some point in our lives – Titanic is a beautiful celebration of nostalgia. ,"I have a nasty reputation of crying at the drop of a hat during sentimental movies. My theory is it all started with my first viewing of Titanic, in 1997. I was a child, unaware of the tragedy of the film. I barely connected with Rose or Jack as an 8 year old, but I cried at every remotely emotional moment, by virtue of the overwhelming feeling that Titanic imparts with. Nearly 15 years later, as a 23 year old, I still cried the same amount after watching Titantic in 3D. I still felt the same rush of emotions through the film: anticipation, heart fluttering and mush even though I tried to fight it. I’ll admit I was expecting to be blown away by the 3D technology, especially in the last half hour of the film, but it merely remained a subtle layer of the film. However, of all the films that are being shot/projected in 3D, Titanic seemed the most logical choice - mostly because of the grandeur of the film. The use of 3D doesn’t make you cringe at any point, or make you feel like it was a waste of an alteration or your money. The 3D holds your gaze – when the piles of delicate plates fall off the rack, when each compartment gets flooded with water - you feel a lot closer to the on-screen happenings.  By virtue of that, Titanic in 3D is worth watching on the big screen. For those of you who have forgotten what the film is about, it’s a revisit to the 1912 tragedy of Titanic. After been hit by an iceberg in the wee hours of the morning, the “unsinkable” ship Titanic sunk to bottom of the ocean taking with it close to 1500 people. James Cameron’s Titanic portrays the love between young Rose and Jack Dawson who meet on the ship. Theirs is a clandestine affair, as they belong to different social backgrounds. Rose is aristocratic, and has a fiancé. Her life is already decided for her at the age of 17. She meets Jack, a vagabond artist who changes her perception of life. Its puppy love at its best – also some of our first ever memories of love seen on the big screen (atleast my generation). Along with Celine Dion’s 'My Heart Will Go On', the entire package became sort of an anthem of love for us. I remembered telling myself as a 10 year old that I want to marry someone like Jack. Surprisingly, when I saw the film again this time, I was still that 10-year-old girl. That’s the beauty of Titanic. It wraps you in its story and doesn’t let you age for the 3 and a half hours that it runs. Titanic is not a film – it’s a timeless pop-cultural reference for every movie lover. No matter how much we talk about it, there will still be more to discuss and reminisce. Nobody dare called it melodramatic when it was released – and I’m sure the last on your mind when you watch it on the big screen will be melodrama. Sure, the visuals and background music are grand, but a small part of you sinks with the Titanic. It’s a part that will continuously haunt you every time you watch the film, and James Cameron has banked on that emotion with a re-release of the film. Watch Titanic in 3D for every reason you watched it the first time around, and every time it glued you when it came on TV. You might not feel anything new, but you will walk out with a warm feeling in your heart.

545,1245,1245,1245,1245,Titli,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewPreview23 Critic Reviews 4.3/5.0 99 Tweet Reviews 4.6/5.0,/movie/titli-review/,4.3/5.0,,4.6/5.0,4.3,"Noir taken to such a grim level that you disconnect after a bit and begin to look at it as someone narrating a gruesome story. Unfortunately, the story and its characters are just that – gruesome, not interesting. ","A world that you have heard of, you know exists but have hardly ever chanced upon it. Whatever your experience in life, newspaper stories do manage to keep you aware of the cruel world out there, where a 'human' is capable of anything – good and equally bad or even worse. So intense and brutal is Titli's world that you have no option but to disconnect from it, to survive it – like difficult times in life. This disconnect however, because it is a film takes the mind to the things missing in the film – well-fleshed out characters, for instance. Sure, the characters are all grey. They are cruel and yet for the people they care about, they are tender. Yet, each character in the film comes across as untrustworthy. The world they inhabit is such – you can trust no one. However, this is all established in the first few minutes of the film. From there on, it is pretty much repetition of the same. You do wonder how Titli, the title character will get out of the mess. But, I am not sure, I am rooting for him. When one is watching out for only oneself, don't they get what they deserve? But hey, that's how real life plays out. And all departments work towards this reality. The art direction with the little things lying around in the background, the clothes the characters wear, the minimal background music along with the natural sounds. So much so that at one point I wondered if having people gargle aloud while brushing their teeth is the easiest way to get the “real” feel. There are a couple of scenes that are way too cruel that you wish them to be unreal. The cynicism of every human being in a certain environment wanting to pay pain forward gets slightly overwhelming. But, you desensitize yourself to it soon enough. And get distracted by various threads in the film left midway.Virkam (Ranveer Shorey) the oldest brother in this dysfunctional family is omnipresent in the first half. However, in the second half, not only does the character disappear but so does his effect on the youngest brother and protagonist, Titli (Shashank Arora). The one in between, the unofficial mediator, Bawla (Amit Sial) is left as that – the one who calms everyone down, except for a glimpse of his own struggle. But, the glimpse is not followed through on, then why show it at all? Neelu (Shivani Raghuvanshi), Titli's wife plays her role as a daughter and daughter-in-law but has her own secrets. The father (Lalit Behl) is the quirk, the only one who arouses a smirk in this stark environment. Titli, the film, has no room for humor. It is relentless which works very well for the film. All the actors pitch in perfectly. Shashank Arora is deadpan, which works for Titli because the brutal things that happen around him do affect him, but he plays cool. He knows how his behaviour ought to be different with different people. However, whether this will work in the next film, is something we will have to wait and watch. Ranveer Shorey's Vikram certainly deserved more space in this film. His foul-mouthed screen presence in the first film had me believe that the film was about his character. Titli pretty much says what it has to say in its two-minute trailer. After that it is like the follow-up slides in a presentation that elaborate on each point. The expansion could have added a lot of value, but doesn't quite do it.

546,1246,1246,1246,1246,To Rome With Love,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review1 Reader Review 0/5.0,/movie/to-rome-with-love-review/,,0/5.0,,4.45,"Unlike his earlier films Midnight in Paris and Vicky Christina Barcelona, To Rome With Love isn’t as heavy-duty neurotic and fantastical. With the right amount of verbosity, wit and breeziness, the film allows you to indulge in and explore the city of Rome and the effervescence that it brings to the characters. You know a film has served its purpose when you can hear the people sitting behind you say, “That is such a Woody Allen film!”","I have a theory – you can only truly enjoy a Woody Allen film if you carry with you a bit of neuroticism. Like they sometimes ask you to leave your brains at home for mindless entertainers, I suggest you carry an extra set of wit, over-analyses, free-flowing thought and a little craze in order to truly enjoy any Woody Allen movie. Don’t ask why; just step right into his world.Of course, his last few films have been celebratory odes to classic cities like London (Cassandra’s Dream), Paris (Midnight in Paris), Barcelona (Vicky Christina Barcelona) and now Rome with To Rome With Love, but he never really leaves behind his volley of indulgent, neurotic one-liners and exploration of human emotion. It’s the Woody Allen stamp that makes this film charismatic and funny, and you ought  to watch the film for that sheer warm feeling in your heart.In To Rome With Love, he continues to write his on-going love letter to Europe, by introducing a concoction of stories that make Rome such a delightful place to be. He also categorizes Rome as a catalyst for the basic deconstruction of the human emotions that we take granted for: love, loyalty and simplicity to quote a few. Every parallel narrative brings our characters out of their worlds to experience something out of the ordinary, in order to remind them not to take the potential of being alive for granted. Following four separate story lines, the film traces different set of characters and their experiences with Rome. Expatriates and students, Sally and Jack (Greta Gerwig and Jesse Eisenberg) are a couple who find trouble when Sally’s friend Monica (Ellen Page), a neurotic, vixen like character. The story is pulled through the looming presence of John (Alec Baldwin), who meets Jack while he is visiting his old neighborhood. John’s presence becomes like an older, more mature version of Jack’s conscience providing witty insights to his adulterous experience.There’s also a small-town couple, Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) and Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi), who relocate to Rome to start a new life. They get whirl-pooled into a messy, almost slapstick situation as Antonio has a run in with a prostitute (Penelope Cruz). On the other hand Milly gets lost in the city, and finds herself on a movie set with her favorite star Luca Salta (Antonia Albanese). Their innocence gets humorously trampled as each find themselves giving into temptation and nerves. Perhaps two of the most absurd yet hilarious storylines belong to Roberto Benigni (who plays a common Roman man called Leopoldo) and Fabio Armiliato  (playing a bathroom opera singer). Each of the stories are confusing, complex and ever meandering, and as you’re running around in circles with the characters you aren’t allowed a moment to retain your calm. To Rome With Love throws at you twisted deductions, as well as known emotions and analyses that are entertaining to watch, nonetheless. Cinematographer Darius Khondji gives us a spectacular bird-eye view of the city and it’s cinematic interruptions into the narrative. Allen establishes the flavor of Rome well, and much like his earlier films, makes you want to experience the city first hand.There is a point in the film, when all the mishaps (both comical and contemplative) have occurred, where Alec Baldwin says to Jesse Eisenberg, “A foolish man once said, Stuff happens”. As a viewer you know the potential of that underplayed sentence because in To Rome With Love, stuff does in fact merely happen. But it brings a well-thought, well-entertained smile on your face.

It’s one of those simple one-line plots that if told well could be both entertaining and insightful. But, this is neither, mainly because its loud and tries too hard to keep it light.","Almost each one of us who was/is of the ""marriageable"" age has encountered at least one well-meaning distant relative who thinks we are the most eligible. The one who takes it upon themselves to find you the perfect life-partner. Well, To Baat Pakki is about one such lady, Rajeshwari (Tabu). No, she's not the eligible one, she's the dreaded relative. Her existence seems to revolve around finding the perfect groom for her little sister. There's lots of room for comedy, but only a tinee-winee bit is explored. The rating of course, clearly that there isn't much to look forward to in To Baat Pakki but the main character, Rajeshwari fascinated me. Of course, she is the standard, ultra-involved, annoying meddler. But, she is still the older sister. So, though it's never too obviously stated, you see a very heavy tinge of gray in her character. She wants for her sister what she could never get. She wants to live vicariously through her. Maybe, that's what most of those distant relatives mean to do using us, and that is exactly what makes them uber-irritating. And despite this interesting character, who you keep suspecting will turn the tables, the movie is pretty flat. The other characters barely arouse interest. And these were the exact characteristics of a Hrishikesh Mukherjee film. Common man, with common aspirations. A non-trivial social issue portrayed in a light manner. But somehow, everything in To Baat Pakki looks like a failed attempt. Except for a couple of the performances. Tabu must be one of the very few women who can pull of comic timing elegantly. She seems just perfect in the role. Interestingly, though age has taken its toll with the lady and she isn't half as engaging to look at as she used to be, this seems to have worked to the character's advantage. However, this is very little to carry the film through its entire length. It gets slapsticky in some parts, tardy in others. The light moments once in a while manage a half-smile out of you despite some decent performances. 
Other than that, the background music is extremely loud, irrelevant and thus distracting. The song and dance sequences follow the patterns of those followed in the 90s but with some decent camerawork to grab your attention. The songs themselves are…well, I don't remember. So, there you go.Toh Baat Pakki looks at an intriguing aspect of our social lives. But does it so flatly and yet with general ado, that it's more or less a painful watch. So, skip this one, there will be more Fridays and ensuing weekends that will have a movie worth the time.

It points a huge finger at sexism and the politics of both home and nation. But, is extremely preachy through most of it. ","It is not easy. To make a film about a social issue while keeping things light and the smile on. In fact, it is much riskier than make a serious film that takes on a taboo social message. Toilet - Ek Prem Katha is not just about absence of toilets in villages and the relatted sanitation, safety and shame issues. It is about religious superstition, it is about everyday sexism, it is about domestic power dynamics, it is about politics and corruption. And because it is about so many things, it doesn't do justice to most of the issues and leads to a lame, convenient climax while being preachy in bits and spurts, through the film. The one thing that Toilet - Ek Prem Katha attempts to attack from all angles is sexism. Any Indian woman who has spent a reasonable amount of time with the older generation and/or in rural areas has been told or seen someone being told all of these, “you are the woman, you have to compromise”, “what's the big deal, everyone does it”, “education has corrupted your thoughts/culture”, and so on. From the relatively liberal comes the gem, “a woman is a woman's worst enemy” - there is no response to that, there cannot be. Because, very often, it is true. But, should society get away with saying that? In that sense, the film feels quite real. Sure, there might not be an Akshay Kumar fighting your cause, but other than that, the lines strike a knowing chord. There's a scene in the film where a woman is being supported by men around her when she is standing up against other women. It made me scoff, “what's the point, she needed a man to protect her.”  At the same time, of course, we do need men's support in reel life and real to deal with day-to-day gender-related issues. The problem is, in scenes like these, reality breaks down. Real life doesn't have so much drama. Real life isn't a constant shouting match. Real life doesn't have one scene with all men who are in favour of women's liberalism and another with all against. This is where Toilet - Ek Prem Katha gives way by making the characters or even parts of the screen either black or white. Sure, they went deeper into the problem and exposed the multiple facets of the problem. When we hear of the toilet situation in India or when we experience it first hand, we think of sanitation, of government mismanagement. We expect and indeed find bureacracy and corruption. But that the slogan, “every house should have a toilet” could be opposed on grounds of personal beliefs is something we completely ignore. Unfortunately, even though this is hammered down quite fervently, the resolution comes about quite easily. At one point, well past intermission, I was thinking, “oh dear, how are Keshav and Jaya going to get out of this soup, there is hardly an hour left”. But, little did I think they will take the easiest route out. I felt like I was cheated by the writers. And not only because they served me songs instead of story. The film is unevenly paced with a lot happening in the last hour. Also, it's not like the writers gave me insight or entertainment in terms of dialogue. Save a few here and there, there aren't great quips. There is toilet humor sprinkled around, but it is more matter-of-fact than slapstick. Thank goodness for some mercies. However, there one-too-many speeches that are holier-than-thou monologues. Of course, they become quite exasperating. It is not that the dialogue delivery is exceptional. It is what one would expect, though I did find Bhumi Pednekar (Jaya) a little too loud when she goes into her activism mode. Akshay Kumar (Keshav) does nothing new, it could be any other film where he isn't an action hero. Sudhir Pandey on the other hand, and Divyendu Sharma bring better relevance to their characters. I also liked Shubha Khote's presence – well, at least until her last scene. But then, her character as Keshav's grandmother seems back-calculated and forced. Just like the comment on Keshav's sunglasses in a court scene. It is to create a particular situation or for a particular line to be said that Keshav's grandmom exists, and for that matter, the sunglasses. The same goes for Anupam Kher's character, who seems to be always around at the correct time to say the appropriate line. They don't even bother to have him present in the scene, he just enters the scene to say the line, as if he was eavesdropping. This snap in continuity is bothersome because it happens with other characters too, with one aim - to add drama. I'm unable to reconcile this unevenness in writing. At one hand you have heavy-handed dialogue and shabbily written scenes that focus only on the drama. And on the other hand, you have important issues taken up with reasonable detail. For Toilet - Ek Prem Katha is also a lot about how one segment of society takes the other for granted - be it across the urban/rural, powerful/oppressed, man/woman, educated/uneducated  or rich/poor divide. Each of these divides has one party with an upper hand and that party is oblivious to how the other party is thriving. You do see multiple facets being played out. Unfortunately, they are bogged down by their own heavy-handedness.

There's an attempt to cram everything seen in films from Hollywood in one film, whether or not there's room for the concept. Yet, it might not be a bad entertainer for kids with some caramel popcorn handy.","An exciting start introduces you to a gamut of cartoon characters who largely represent real-life stereotypes but have potential to entertain. Unfortunately, the length of the film is restricted by the attention span of the target audience, clearly under 10. Hence, no justice can be done to any of those characters. So, you are left with a mish-mash of characters that just about stay together as a story. A story of a father wanting to be a hero for his kids, so what if it is fighting cartoons with the help of cartoons.I'm sure kids below ten will enjoy the film, its gimmickry, slapstick included. But, I don't really like the idea of well-endowed women trying to move it and attract the attention of a man they woo by calling him handsome and hot. More so because these women are animated and meant to entertain kidsSure, there's more to the film than the vamp, the anti-vamp and the wife who's insecure of women in sketch. I liked the bit where a dad's presence at a school race is more important to a child than the race itself. Similarly, it felt warm to see the importance a dad gives to his son's admonition and name-calling because the dad sees truth in it. But this warmth fizzles out as characters are introduced and you are disconnected slowly and surely from one and all. You don't root for anyone and you aren't scared for anyone's safety because of the threat the villain poses. In fact, the villain isn't given enough screen time to make an impact at all; most of it is hogged by Ajay Devgn and his childish antics. This is even more evident when some room is given to ""rub-doot"", a cartoon eraser. Those 5-7 minutes of his screen time are thoroughly enjoyable. I wish more such fun times were spent writing meatier bits for other characters. Over and above being superior to animation done thus far, we need some superior writing - animation or not. The wonderful glimpse you get makes you wonder, why you couldn't have had more. For those few moments, I just might send my kids to watch the film. Or maybe will have them wait for the DVD to be out on rent. Or maybe not. Or whatever.

Made in a manner which will remind you of the TV series, it is the kind of film that will just not hold the attention of the more fidgety young ones.","In India, you've really got to be a 90s child to know and appreciate Top Cat, although the character and series itself harks back to US television of the 60s. I may be wrong, but I don't think that children today are very big fans of the adventures of Hanna-Barbera's enterprising alley cat character. Since Top Cat was a part of my television experience while growing up, I was mildly interested in watching a film adaptation of it. The film itself is goofy, endearing and silly fun at times, but isn't something you absolutely have to take your children for. Directed by Alberto Mar, the film was originally made in Spanish, for a Mexican audience, because the series was apparently a huge hit in Mexico. The film has nothing new to offer in terms of a plot or setting. Top Cat or TC, as he is fondly called by his faithful sidekicks, is up to his usual scams and tomfoolery in his favourite New York alley. Their lives, and indeed the life of every New Yorker goes for a toss when a new, narcissistic and tyrannical Police Chief takes over the city. TC's resourcefulness is tested to the hilt as he faces off against his newest enemy. While it really is hard to fault the filmmakers for it, Top Cat just doesn't have the enigmatic pull of other iconic cartoon characters. The humour often feels dated and I often found myself wondering if children today would actually have the patience to sit through something as innocent as the escapades of cats that seem to be no different from human beings. In fact, in Top Cat, no one seems to know if a character is a dog, a cat or a human being unless the character announces it themselves.The film does deal with universal themes like friendship and morals, as well as the dangers of submitting oneself completely to technology. Also, and this is the best part of the film and the character, the message is conveyed in a clean and honest manner. The treatment itself is absolutely no different from the cartoon series, though. It follows the same structure that an episode of the cartoon does, so you pretty much know exactly how the film is going to end.While I watched the film in 2D, I suspect that the 3D version isn't going to add much value in terms of the theatrical experience either. I hate to say this, (because they just don't make clean, old-fashioned, fun cartoons like TC anymore) but missing Top Cat, the film, is like missing nothing at all.

Greed and deceit replace friendships in this thriller in quite an inhumane fashion. ","A film where the main characters find a load of cash has huge potential for characters and their reaction to the windfall. Even if you have the standard one good guy who wants nothing to do with it, another few that are outright criminal in their intent, a couple in-betweens, there is enough scope to make it an intense character fight. But, Toss takes the other route, making itself a full-fledged whodunit thriller. Fair enough. But it outlives its welcome by creating suspicion for each character. While it's interesting for a bit, it gets tiring and you want it to be done with. Toss is a depiction of the darkest side of humans. Enter money matters and everything else goes for a toss - love, friendship, honesty. And selfishness takes over within a blink of the eye. Perfectly humane characters can turn into cold-blooded murderers of the worst kind - the kind who can kill friends without remorse. To add to the darkness there are sudden spurts of comedy which take away from the thrill achieved so far. Maybe it happens, but there isn't enough development for it to be convincing. Also, even if there is an innate beauty in leaving questions unanswered, here they feel more like a lapse in writing than an intentional part of the art. Also films that have all villains and no heroes or token heroes leave you no one to care for. As if this display is not enough there's a display of kids getting a kick out of torturing other humans. That might be the way nature has made us but sensitivity is completely missing here. So, if the thrills get cumbersome and the characters aren't appealing what is the viewer left with? Performances, right? Out of the lot, Prashant Raj seemed to be the only one who took his job seriously. Even if the dubbing is totally off for the women, it is only one of the contributing factors for the out-and-out shoddy job done by them all. However it is nice to see Sushant Singh as a diffident character. Despite a general lack of talent in the acting department, it is commendable that none of the characters are loud. Except of course, Rajpal Yadav who spoils the little decorum with his quirkiness for his bit-role. The wannabe cool shots, especially the close-ups of random objects which are meant to inspire fear, reminded me of RGV's Phoonk. Also, though the background music was abrupt at many places, there are spots where the strings used sound different and nice. But the consistent music is a bit overwhelming. Not to mention that the Bhangra song was out of place and not a pleasure to listen to. It looked like an opportunity missed for what could have been an edge-of-the-seat noir depiction of us as people. The main culprit, despite the lack of attention to writing, is the length. You could take this one on when you have a remote to your aide.

A quirkily different situation in a regular family; the story of the film spans a short time - in this case just a day; all infused with humor. Unfortunately, the last bit doesn't work too well for Total Siyapaa. The attempt at humor is pretty mediocre and falls flat almost all along the way.There are a couple of times that the lines are really funny and will get a huge laugh out of you. But, other than that, all you do is wonder what is happening and why? This could actually be true of any film with quirky characters and situations. The difference though is that in the ones that are well made, you don't wonder, you just let go and enjoy.Total Siyapaa is something that you just sit through. In the right frame of mind, it won't seem bad enough that you are enduring it. But, it does have immense potential do that to you. The characters just aren't engaging. It then is all left to the situations, the dialogue and the actors. The situation of an Indian girl, Asha (Yami Gautam) bringing home a Pakistani boy, Aman (Ali Zafar) had lots of potential to go either way. To either be out-of-the-world hilarious or to go all jingoistic on you. Fortunately and/or unfortunately it doesn't do either. And as most middle grounds are, it becomes boring.Other than Anupam Kher who is hilarious in his short appearance, the other supporting cast more-or-less overacts. Yami Gautam doesn't have too much to do and Ali Zafar hams as usual. For some reason, I always find Ali Zafar's dubbing off, it comes out way too loud and seems affected. As with most films that seem funny in the trailers, Total Siyapaa exhausts all its funny lines in its two-minute trailer. As we expected and yet, sad.

553,1253,1253,1253,1253,Touring Talkies,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/touring-talkies-review/,,,,2.35,"Gajendra Ahire’s Touring Talkies is an ode to the movies; and a sincere, beautiful one at that. Powered by a tremendous performance by Trupti Bhoir and sheer passion towards cinema, it is the kind of film that needs to be watched; as they say, life is life, and film is film. ","“The purest form of cinema is life.” – AnonymousIf there’s one film in recent times that underlines the statement above, it is Gajendra Ahire’s Touring Talkies. An honest, heartfelt and pertinent movie about the movies, Ahire’s latest is the kind of film that can make anyone who loves cinema shed a tear, if only for the sake of their own love for it.From being a thriving business and the only way cinema was consumed in India commercially in the early 20th century, touring talkies are now all but extinct; alive only in certain pockets of rural India, but barely so. Gajendra Ahire shows us a peek into the lives of those whose livelihoods still depend on setting up makeshift tents and projecting film inside it by night, while leading the existence of nomads by day. He does it by telling us the story of Chandi, a woman of infinite will and energy, in what has unfortunately and unfairly come to become a man’s world.In showing us Chandi’s journey, Ahire shows us life; he shows us how cinema mirrors society and never the other way around; he shows us that cinema exists even if a camera does not. Because, you see, cinema exists where there is a beating heart and the basest and most primal of emotions, irrespective of the presence or lack of an observer. But Chandi’s life does have an observer, in the form of a filmmaker from Mumbai, who initially enters her life only because he wants his film, acclaimed on the festival circuit, to now be screened at the touring talkies. The enterprising Chandi is also a bit of a cinema expert, if only in the manner in which she understands the very concept of the fact that life drives it. She understands the art of cinema, as well as the commerce. She seems to understand that even commercial cinema is derived from an art form, and even artistic cinema needs to be sold. And watch how they gently rib one of the big commercial successes of recent times, one that made tons of money despite being as bad as it was. With beautiful little touches, Ahire shows us how much Chandi loves cinema, and in doing so, he reminds us how much we love cinema as well. Touring talkies are dying, and from the looks of it, the Internet may end up killing conventional brick-and-mortar cinema halls as well. But cinema will live on, no matter what. Yes, the screenplay of the film needed to be tighter, and weightier, if I may say so. It meanders a bit, tends to sag slightly, and does have the odd implausible turn. We also never fully see just why the filmmaker, Avinash, embarks on such an emotionally intense journey with a touring talkie, why he puts his own life on the backburner to be a part of someone else’s. Love for cinema, perhaps; but it needed to be written stronger. But the maturity with which Gajendra Ahire directs, overshadows the flaws in the writing. In fact, Ahire is easily one of the most mature filmmakers India has currently. The manner in which he frames and composes his shots, what each shot and scene conveys; everything about his filmmaking shows maturity and an understanding of the art and science of cinema. Even technically, the film holds its own. Amol Gole’s cinematography is top notch; the wonderful earthy colour palette brings the frames alive. Also, hat-off to maestro Ilaiyaraja’s music and background score. Once again, he shows that few understand what a scene needs musically better than him. It is lively and electric when required, and subtly haunting when the need arises. I didn’t particularly understand the need to have English lyrics for songs, but then, it perhaps is reflective of the personality of Avinash – an English-speaking, city-bred filmmaker with almost European sensibilities when it comes to his outlook towards cinema.The throbbing, pulsating heart of the film is Trupti Bhoir’s performance as Chandi. She sheds her inhibitions, exhibits a look that few female leads in cinema would dare, and pumps in her all into Chandi. She is a livewire, and she literally lives the character. Subodh Bhave as Avinash does well, as always. He does look like a bit of a misfit at times, but his pleasing presence makes up for it. Kishor Kadam and Milind Shinde in supporting roles don’t have much to do, but the two of them always seem to get into the skin of characters they play, which they do here as well.Quite like how Martin Scorsese’s Hugo was his love letter to the movies, Touring Talkies is  for Gajendra Ahire. It is a film that needs to be seen for many reasons, the most important one of them being sheer passion for cinema, and to understand what the sound of the whirring projector means to some of us. Watch Touring Talkies on the big screen, if only to respect that medium which is most disrespected and misused. Perhaps you’ll see why, for some of us, cinema is all about life, and life is all about cinema.

554,1254,1254,1254,1254,[The] Tourist,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/tourist-review/,,4/5.0,,2.85,"A mysterious woman includes an innocent tourist in a dangerous plan. Slow on pace, it fails to thrill. And despite the talented cast, this one is at best a plain and mediocre film.  ","A mysterious woman on a train coupled with mistaken identity of a tourist, definitely sounds interesting. Add to that inept cops and a clichéd gangster with his Russian henchmen, and you have The Tourist. The plot looks intriguing in the trailer, but turns out to be extremely stupid. It is very slow, and is only about dialogues. The story is just a pick up from any silly thriller.  It is mostly predictable, because nothing happens in the movie! The only value is a very talented cast and the cinematography.There are zero adrenaline moments. The amount of focus on Elise (Angelina Jolie) made me think this would turn out to be something like a Hitchcock movie. But it was below expectations, even with all the flair. 
I always wonder why the cops in such movies are so stupid, and this one just adds to my curiosity. People  standing around passively when pistols are shot, makes the entire thing look unreal. The lack of real twists weighs down hard on the film’s genre. Plus the physics of the action sequences are baffling. Almost all of them were unbelievable, and therefore irritating. And what should I say about the gangsters? Ah, losers.
I was looking forward to the film for Johnny Depp. But sadly, he has nothing substantial to do in the movie. He is comical, and does have his own charm. But I am so used to seeing him playing quirky, character driven parts, that it feels very odd to see him play a normal role. Angelina Jolie sure looks ravenous  - I mean ravishing. She pulls off her role as a confident woman who doesn’t like circumstances controlling her while manipulating a vulnerable tourist. Another thing I liked is that the film is not dark like other thrillers. The mood throughout the film is light, with a touch of comedy and a flicker of romance. The one-liners are enjoyable, though you'd have seen most of them in the trailer. Venice is made even prettier with the times of the day chosen to shoot her. Unhurried and verbose, the film is at the best mediocre. Jolie fans might like it since it has a lot of close-ups. Depp fans will find disappointment. Wait for a DVD if you really want to watch it. Else, you might as well give this one a pass.

555,1255,1255,1255,1255,Toy Story 3,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/toy-story-3-review/,,,,2.85,"The most emotional chapter in the Toy Story series, this film takes Woody and Co. in a new adventure inside a daycare centre, where they must adapt to the harsh realities, or remain dumped in Andy’s attic as he prepares to leave home for a new life in college. Great moments, fantastic stunts (don’t miss Buzz Lightyear’s Flamenco dance in the end-credits), Toy Story 3 is no ordinary animated feature. Winner of the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film (2010). Nominated for Best Motion Picture, Best Animated Feature at the 2010 Academy Awards.","There’s something weird about past tense. No matter how old you are, you hold your happiest memories so close to you that they seem to have unfolded only yesterday. Watching Toy Story 3 made me rummage through every cupboard in my house trying to find a Hot Wheels car that I used to play with, when  was a kid. I’m 24 now and and I felt melancholic about not being able to find it. Suddenly, out of the blue, I feel a longing for all my toys. And you might feel the same, if you’ve also had a set of toys that you always played with in your childhood.Toy Story 3 is the most emotional chapter of the series, which saw its first film debut way back in 1995. Come to think of it, like every happy memory, this too seems like only yesterday. And the third instalment’s success and acclaim (winning an Oscar nomination for Best Picture) symbolizes an important moment in animation film history. This is the second year in a row that Disney Pixar’s produced a such a good film - last year, Up was nominated in the same category.On DVD, a single viewing of the film is enough to convince that such acknowledgment is well-deserved. Right from the film’s opening sequence (a fitting tribute to the Westerns, Jurassic Park, E.T, Superman), Toy Story 3 is an immersive experience. At times, it throws up a question that we’re often faced in life - should we be there for someone with whom we’re ‘meant to be’, or should be learn to move on as times have changed? Director Lee Unkrich helps you find the answer through a premise that we could see coming. Andy, the child who owns the toys, is now grown-up and is about to leave home for a new life in college. Faced with a decision to dispose off or donate his old toys, his mother, mistakenly ends up handing them over to a day-care centre where a new life awaits Woody and gang.One of the biggest strengths of the Toy Story series is that it successfully manages to help humans, empathise with the emotions of toys. Every toy wants to be played with and in the process, feel a sense of bonhomie, heroism and companionship with its owner. Every toy wants to be a character in whatever fantasy a child conjures up in its head - no matter how stupid it may be. It likes loyalty. Which is why, although excited by the colourful exteriors of the daycare centre, they find grief in the kind of treatment meted out to them. Clearly, abandonment and rejection from their owners are the biggest heart-breakers for toys.The script weaves in these themes by introducing a new set of characters - the teddy bear Lotso (Ned Beatty) being the most noteworthy of them. He is huggable on the outside, but grim inside, and it makes him one of the most unique, cold blooded villains you’ve seen in animation films.Toy Story 3 promises more thrills than laughs, honestly. That may hamper repeat viewing, in my opinion (I skimmed through several sequences on second viewing) but those thrills serve a purpose. For the first time, you’re confronted with the possibility of seeing these toys destroyed. It’s a poignant moment in the film, one that reminds us of how close we’ve become to Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and gang, over the years. It’s also the reason why the climax is an emotional one.The rich collection of bonus features in the DVD makes this an almost ideal home video buy. Among the highlights, there’s an outstanding theatrical short (Day and Night) which has all the wit and social subtext that comes with Disney Pixar shorts. In other features, my favourite is a set of three videos, titled Studio Stories. They give us an awe inspiring glimpse of life and culture at Pixar - for example, a cereal bar stocks almost every kind of cereal on the planet. You’ll also learn that the crew shaved off their head and moustache before working on this film. There’s also a heartwarming tribute to the significance of editors in a film, especially an animation one. A number of editors talk to the camera to explain what they do and how they make a difference in the entire pipeline of tasks that comes with putting together a film like this. The behind- the-scenes, interviews with the cast and crew round up the extras on the DVD nicely.

It is another kind of mish-mash, the kind that symbolises road traffic typical of any Indian metropolis, maybe? It manages to scrape through as a reasonable thriller, even if it is predictable. A donated organ needs to cross 160 kilometers in just 2.5 hours. Interestingly enough, it is not the predictability that takes the film down, it is the pace and laughable moments of drama created.The drama is hardly necessary. Although arguably, any drama at all can be avoided, in this particular case, the plot is interesting enough to pull the movie through. It didn't need any external assistance. In fact, the drama comes in the way of you getting on the edge of your seat. This in turn ends up lengthening the film. At a good 15 minutes less than 2 hours, Traffic isn't a long film and even so feels elongated beyond what could have kept it thrilling. Individual scenes elongate. “Reveals” are over-explained. Despite a low budget, no frills show, there are a few scenes that are done really well. Then there are the obvious product placements and lapses like mobile phones that work in rain that serve as distractions too. However, the two things that hold Traffic together are the basic plot and the commentary it tries to engage its audience in. The performances aren't particularly bad, but they seem rather superficial even though every one cries really well. They manage to bring a lump in the throat. Of course, actors like Divya Dutta, Manoj Bajpai, Sachin Khedekar, Kitu Gidwani, Vikram Gokhale and Jimmy Sheirgill try to infuse as much energy as is possible in the lacklustre dialogue. However, this brings the performances all together only to a not-bad-not-great level. The general comment on social fabric though is what keeps you engaged. Much like a web Traffic touches on the taboo that being involved with a widow is to dowry to wide prevalence of extra-marital affairs to the corruption and need thereof in the system to value and power of VIPs. I especially liked the little things like the  clamor of media and general public oblivious to the urgency of the situation and a character not wearing a seat belt despite of the various road accidents they've seen so far and the precarious situation he is in currently. That's just how we are. All of the above is done without getting in your face – just a part of the story. In fact, leaving enough room to make you wonder about things going on in the film vis-à-vis real life. What if it were not a VIP situation, would it have worked out? Of course, it just might have, there is no reason to go cynical, but it does cross your mind - this when there were VIPs involved, what if it were a common man? It makes you think about the things  - What would have to be at stake for you to take unimaginable, selfless risks? On the other hand, is it because you feel you have nothing left too lose? I should point out here though that the intensity of the traffic problem is only in words here. You barely see any major trouble being caused by it.However, does the situation - yours, society's - resemble that of the dense web of road traffic?

Traffic Signal highlights the fact that even basti-dwellers have their aspirations, not necessarily acceptable as the ""right"" priorities. I liked the direction and the screenplay. The climax takes the cake, creating an impact without fuss.","Yes, it is yet another movie about the victimized protagonist succumbing under the pressure of the “system”.  But this one is dealt with a touch of humor, dark at times, but funny nevertheless. The flow in the screenplay is gripping. The power flow from the street beggar to the business world - via the traffic signal leader, the mafia, and the politicians – has been shown with great expertise. Madhur Bhandarkar needs to be applauded for the choice of subject for various reasons. We all see street beggars everyday. Either we choose to ignore them or we choose to feel good about ourselves by throwing a coin or two at them. Either which way, most of us certainly choose to forget them after the 100 odd seconds we spend cursing the red light. Then would we want to spend the 100 odd minutes watching a movie about the life at that traffic light? Huge risk! The movie reflects what most of us believe to be true. The people at these lights are victims, but they are liars too. They are actors performing live. All of them are part of a huge scam - Right from the child in the arms of a young mother to the almost nude, crazy old man. The director has taken up the challenge of making you empathize with all of them – right from the gay sex worker to the loser drug addict. By interval time, you are settling down to the idea of having a story-less movie, saying to yourself “oh, I see, this is one of those slice-of-life things”. Then slowly you see the story emerging and very smoothly translating into a compact climax. The ending had a punch with just the right amount of drama and not much ado. The acting of the main characters is mostly a pleasant surprise. Kunal Khemu says his lines in a monotonously annoying manner. You want to yell out “talk properly, for heaven’s sake”. And suddenly you realize that is exactly what you would say to a person with an “I-own-this-place” attitude, which happens to be the character he plays. And then you warm up towards the character. Similary, though Neetu Chandra, Konkona Sen Sharma, and Ranvir Shorey (especially his introductory scene) have very small roles to play, not for one line will you feel that they are not the character they are playing. The one thing that did not work though is the make-up of Kunal Khemu and Neeta Chandra, they looked artificially dark. Due to the number of lives a traffic signal nexus touches (at least 50), there is a long list in the supporting cast. Overall, the supporting cast is average. While some got under the skin of the character (Upendra Limaye) the others delivered their plain dialogues rather unconvincingly (Sudesh Mishra). The dialogues are very clearly not meant to be either profound or dramatic. However, the funny lines do achieve their purpose of getting a good laugh out of you.  Traffic Signal  will be added to the list of movies that deal with social issues in a crude yet sensitive manner. It gives you the reality but does not slap it across your face. And it shows you, in a lighter vein, how differently the poorest rank their priorities from the conventional “right”.

The film doesn't try to hard to make the audience like it, which is perhaps why it is unlikely to gain much love from the audience.","Wally Pfister – Christopher Nolan’s long time collaborator as cinematographer – makes his directorial debut with Transcendence, and the first word that comes to my mind to describe this first film he gives us, is ‘strange’. Transcendence instantly slots itself into the sci-fi space. But the sci-fi element is mostly relegated to the background. While one can’t say that it has been dumbed down per se, it just exists like gentle fumes behind more philosophical and moral themes that the film talks about – about the dangers of fusing technology with human thought, and to what limits a humanity can go to, once such powers are in our hands.It is also a human drama of sorts. Except, there is nothing dramatic about the film. It doesn’t particularly have a graph or a journey for the characters – at least not in the usual cinematic sense of an arc. Then of course, it is a thriller. Yet again, though, it is a thriller that doesn’t thrill outright. It doesn’t have peaks and moments that leap out to shock you. It makes do with just a sense of foreboding – making you wait for something to happen; that something never really happens. It expects you to be content with the journey, not the destination.Lastly, it is also a strange sort of romance – where the lead pair hardly ever spends screen time together, and the love they share transcends everything that we’ve come to accept as ‘normal’. This, I suspect, is one of the reasons behind the film’s title, though there is also another reason that is given in the film.Transcendence is about an extraordinary researcher named Will Caster, who is on the cusp of taking artificial intelligence into uncharted realms. However, a fringe group of activists is against empowering machines so much. The clash between these two streams of thought eventually leads Caster on to something much bigger than anyone ever hoped; and then Will and his wife Evelyn are separated in a manner they never even dreamed of.It is interesting, the manner in which Pfister treats his film. An old school man, Pfister shoots his film lovingly, on film. The grainy look hardly ever betrays that the film is actually about high end, ultra radical technology – a strange sort of paradox. He is in no hurry to tell his story, so the pace of the film never ever picks up. It just unfolds slowly, and then it ends.He uses extreme close ups, a number of them abstract, to slow the film further. There are times when it seems like an effort to actually alienate the audience from the film, and in that, the film succeeds quite often – Transcendence is unlikely to win too many fans, because, very crudely put, nothing much happens in the film.Nothing in the film is outright impressive at any level – be it in terms of the plot, the treatment or even the technique. (One audience member even called the film ‘boring’.) The audience can’t quite be faulted here, because one can see that Pfister had no intention of impressing the audience ever.Transcendence is slow poison. Neither does it force the audience to think about the questions it raises, nor does it try to blow their mind with the character of Will Caster and where he ends up. With its unusually staid pace, you end up forgetting the important moral implications of the power of human intellect, which the film holds at its core. It is this core of the film, however, that needs one to take an earnest initiative to truly understand. The film, essentially, has no body. It does, however, have a soul. And souls, we’ve come to believe, live forever. I suspect, then, that it is the sort of film that, in time, will find an audience. The audience of today though, I’m sure, is likely to reject the film.

(Aren’t they all!)?Directed by Michael Bay, he of the big budget, louder than ever, a crash a second movie genre, Transformers is trite, banal, and hackneyed.  Based on a set of toys made by Hasbro and which were popular around twenty years ago in the US of A (aren’t there better sources of inspiration around?), Transformers is all about machines, machines, and more machines.  The movie is a wet dream for technology freaks and for those who dream of absolute power through technological domination.  We have lovingly shot sequences of planes, tanks, and guns, all black and glistening, hard and throbbing, and filled with deadly intent.  We have shots of alien robots, which are amazingly anthropomorphic, (how come, if they are machine intelligences from an alien planet) right down to their lubricating fluid outlets (did you get that one?) metamorphosing themselves into sleek transport machines – trailer trucks, a Ford Camarro, a fighter jet and other unnamables, lest viewers get bored even for a second.  And to make up the rest of the film, we have action scenes involving robots and men, robots versus robots, and robots running amok in the deserts of Qatar destroying good old American military technology.  Yes, there are a few humans scattered in the film, but they are largely inconsequential.  We have the nerdy Sam Witwicky, who has something that the alien robots want and which is hidden in a top-secret location, and we have the obligatory local female hot bod Mikaela Banes, and we have Sam’s parents, and of course, his pet Chihuahua.  We have Jon Voight playing the Secretary of Defence, (in what must be the lousiest role of his career) substituting for a shadow President.  What we do not get is a reasonable plot, character development, and a rationale for all the destruction we see on the screen.  The film is tedium personified and all the special effects by Industrial Light and Magic cannot save it, as I just could not relate to any of the characters.  Yes, the humans end up saving the world and setting things right, but none of it was of any interest to me, as I have seen it all before.  The camera jerks amazingly in the action sequences, as if the cinematographer was trying to convey an out of the body hallucinogenic experience to the viewer.  The sub text is all about America and American technology saving the world, the automobile as a pumped up phallic symbol which would set women drooling and leave men free to do what they really want, which is to have sex with attractive women.  To complete the picture, we have the embodiment of the techno freak fantasy of humans coexisting peacefully with technology that they themselves have created, but which has become so complex and mystifying, that now it is totally alien.   The movie cost something around 150 million dollars, so the word goes, and one wonders whether a larger fraction could have been invested in a bound shooting script and getting hold of real actors!   The audience for the film is assumed to have an IQ slightly smaller than their shoe size, well, so I guess that does not really matter.  The pre pubescent crowd might enjoy the film given that there a few jokes about the masturbatory habits of young, pheromone oozing males, and a scene where Mikaela drapes herself on Sam’s automobile hood, inspects the engine, and makes appreciative noises about pumps, heads, and power!!

The concept is as cool as it was in the first film, but then I might as well just have watched the first one, right? Nope, neither the 3-D nor the rambling story add value. ","I love action films and I love the idea of machines transforming into other machines. Seriously, it's damn neat. It's not only the idea but also the slick way they've been transforming since Transformers (the first in the series). I like how the machines move and the sounds they make while they are at it. As sarcastic as it may sound (given the rating), I mean it. But more of the same? For all of two and a half hours? Naah. Don't make me hate something I love, by overdoing it. Actually, I had already had enough with Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen . The monotony of the action sequence in the climax made me nod off for a good twenty minutes. I'm not proud of it, especially since I was accompanying a Transformer-enthusiast. Oh no, I didn't sleep during this one, I was going to review it, so I couldn't sleep. So, that's no credit to the film. For the non-action minutes in the film, which might be all of 20, there are a few good comic lines and a lot of mumbo-jumbo about freedom. There are good aliens vs. evil aliens. And how they cross and double-cross each other and humans. Which also means, the humans don't get much room to emote. They are scared and tense most, and they continue being that way through the rest of the film. I understand and, maybe, even have come to terms with the fact that action films - of course not all of them - cannot be bothered with a story. And with Transformers: Dark of the Moon I wasn't expecting one either. But the very least they could have done was get creative with the action and the 3D. Some of the ways in which one car turns into a mean machine and back, it looks like a mere cut-and-paste from either an earlier scene or another car, color-corrected. More action, I don't mind. More of the same - I have trouble spending time, energy and money on.

A concrete jungle. Trapped provides the creepy crawls. However, the anxiety is more for what you will be made to watch next, and not on behalf of the character.","Most of this interval-free film, I was waiting for something filmy to happen. Anything. But, no coincidences make you roll your eyes, no one asks you to suspend your disbelief  for a good portion of the film. Shaurya (Rajkummar Rao) is stuck so bad and you know it is only going to get worse. It is just that kind of a film. It doesn't relent. It is an unreal situation in a very real setting. So, if this unlikely event did occur, Shaurya would behave more or less like he does. This works in bringing the chill. But, the eekiness comes from anticipating worse things to happen rather than worrying for Shaurya or even imagining yourself in his place.When your insides physically react to something that is playing on screen, you'd think you come out of the film wowed. However, all I wanted was the Trapped feeling to be off off me, pronto. Sure, you feel relief when Shaurya finds even the littlest release from his tight situation. But, it was difficult to discern if it was for him that I felt relaxed or for myself. That's where the disconnect is.Interestingly, nothing gory is shown explicitly. But the implications have enough of an impact. Maybe it is a cake walk for the regular audience of Fear Factor or some such. But, for the stranger sitting next to me and me, looking at each other was more entertaining than letting that cringe take over the body. Of course, Rajkummar Rao makes you believe every bit – whether it is his gullibility, stupidity or his ingenuity.However, the horror tone in the first half felt like a distraction because Trapped is a “survival and competency” story. Even if it isn't at par with others in the genre, the resemblances to 127 hours, The Martian, (Home Alone?) and even a nod to The Shawshank Redemption are unmissable. Fortunately, what we have seen in Vikramaditya Motwane films so far, is true of Trapped too. Despite the slow pace of the film where at most times it feels like, “nothing is happening”, there isn't a dull moment. While there is nothing lyrical about Trapped, a la Lootera, there is a pulsating aura through and through. The background score works beautifully in tandem with the sounds in the film. 
A movie with a stranded protagonist tends to get philosophical. The backdrop of Mumbai's tall buildings help in making Shaurya and you painfully aware of the smallness of our non-existence.  A situation like that does bring perspective, even if it is lost as the end credits roll. What would you do if you were stuck in a Mumbai building and no one knew of it? Maybe you wouldn't be as stupid as Shaurya. Maybe you would try the smarter things first, the ones that he thought of  later. But, the question is would you be any less desperate? Would you not try everything at your hand? To that extent – making you wonder what you would do – Trapped engages. But, other than that you are looking out to escape the disgust.

562,1262,1262,1262,1262,[The] Tree of Life,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/tree-life-review/,,5/5.0,,4.666666667,"Tree of Lifeis an indulgent film – if you share the same vision as the director, you’ll have entered a life-altering zone with the film where the beauty and grandeur of life will shake you and overpower you. But the film also has the capacity to alienate you with its overtly religious undertones and slow pace.","Terence Malick’s Palme D’or winner Tree of Lifedemarcates its audience into two – the kind that has the patience to watch a tree grow over the years and the kind that will keep coming back every 10 years to quickly monitor its progress. But both kinds acknowledge the magnificence of the tree.Tree of Life is a film that unfolds slowly. In all its passion, whispers, colors and surrealist imagery it tries to tell you the story of a family, and how they grapple with life and death. But it’s not a grim existential crisis, the movie talks about nature and about grace (personified by the father and mother, played by Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain.)The imagery is all-encompassing poetry. We pass through the life of a family living in an American suburb in the 50s, through the eyes of the younger son,  Jack (Sean Penn), who struggles to find answers for his brother’s death, his mother’s soft charm, his father’s disciplinarian demeanor and how that all cumulates into life.We bustle through old-school visuals with watercolors, smokes, liquids, paints and dyes – all of which take us through a symbolic, colorful and magnanimous process of how life originated. It’s a montage of  waterfalls, and erupting lava, amoebae forming, reproduction of every species and every aspect of nature scanned beautifully. The most refreshing twenty minutes in the film, mostly because the visuals are old-school and thankfully we aren’t subjected to high-end visual effects and graphics.We keep sifting through patient and extravagant shots of nature, of life in general and intercutting visuals of the O’Briens' lives. It’s a film about life, and it’s a preachy film but each shot manages to take your breath away. Coupled with the gospel like background score and divine cinematography, the audio-visual experience is almost sublime.However, the narrative structure is leisurely and repetitive; you feel like a slither of a water color, trickling down as slowly as possible, never stopping but moving sporadically. You’ll notice the religious undertones of redemption and forgiveness, you’ll see life through a supreme being’s eyes, but you’ll also zone out amidst all the lovely visuals because the film is basically like an extremely poetic sermon. Some words stun you, some inspire, but some just bore you.If you’re looking for a glimmer of intimacy, inspiration and just to be awed by the naturalness of life, Tree of Life gives you that. The film will motivate you to cleanse your soul, introspect, restructure your life around the beauty that this world is and all that.You’ll just need lots of patience to move with the film.

563,1263,1263,1263,1263,Triumph Of the Will,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review3 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/triumph-will-review/,,4/5.0,,4.333333333,"Triumph Of The Will is one of the best propaganda films made in cinematic history. Directed by Adolf Hitler’s favourite film-maker, Leni Riefenstahl, it captures the grand welcome Germany offers Hitler during his review  visit to Nuremberg for the Nazi Party Congress. Some outstanding speeches by the dictator are shot with an accomplished camera lens. If you’d want to imitate the Fuhrer’s mannerisms and accent any day, this is the film you’ve gotta watch, on loop.","The first effect that Triumph Of The Will produced on me, was to make me temporarily forget Adolf Hitler’s crimes, by simply bowling me over with his oratory skills through the speeches that this documentary is full of. Indeed, there is no other speaker the world has seen, who can not crack you up in that silly moustache, and yet mobilize an entire nation to act as per his command.The second effect: An immense admiration for the film’s female director, Leni Riefenstahl (pronounced Ree-fen-staal) who was commissioned by Hitler himself to make this film.Triumph Of The Will documents Hitler’s visit to Nuremberg to attend the Nazi Party Congress, and the manner in which Riefenstahl has captured the grandeur of that visit, is very wow-worthy. Not just in scale, but also in her employment of camera technique and aesthetics - stuff which perhaps only a woman’s eye can uniquely observe. I say this, because she succeeds in making Hitler not only handsome, but someone who looks to be in charge of his people.Right from the introductory scenes where Hitler’s aircraft floats through the clouds, to its shadow passing over the streets of Nuremberg like a blessing, to his descent and eventual appearance in front of his supporters - it feels as if God himself emerged from the doors of the plane. Riefenstahl does well to hold your attention right upfront. Just when you think that this may turn out to be yet another film filled with grainy, fast-forward worthy footage from history, you’re surprised to see how well-preserved the material still is (a big pat on the back of Enlighten Film Society for making this available in India).Riefenstahl’s crew shot the four-day Congress and in the process, collected over 60 hours of footage. The 109 minutes that you finally see in this film are a mix of Hitler’s speeches made on each day, the Republic Day-kinda parade presented for him displaying the might of the German artillery and Youth Army. There are some rare moments too: you spot Hitler smile once in a while and also witness him getting humbled by the support.His speeches are undoubtedly fiery and the manner in which they’ve been shot, is nothing short of an Obama address. He is often erected on a podium high up in the air, and resulting effect seems to resemble a religious address from the Pope. Hitler however, speaks without any reference material in front of him. He talks right from the heart and with so much passion, you fear his moustache might explode into bits, or his teeth might crunch to pieces. His comments are highly provocative, prejudiced, but his sense of patriotism is unique, almost equating it as a religion of sorts. Throughout the film, the camera does a fine job of capturing people’s reactions, through tight close-ups - be it of the Youth Army poised in attention, or the little kids playing the drums for the band like there was no tomorrow. A chill ran down my spine thinking that all those kids and young men would be dead by now.This film is an accomplishment in cinematic technique, for managing to pull off a grand event of this nature - that too by a woman film-maker in what was then, a man’s world. The agile camera movements, the tight tracking frames of Hitler, the obsession with finding textures in the sea of army men walking in discipline, the low-angle shots providing Hitler a Godly halo - all of them tie in well together and give enough justification as to why this is one of the greatest propaganda films of all time.Leni Reifenstahl, an actress herself, made this film on Hitler’s request. Although skeptical at the beginning,  since she didn’t understand the importance of Hitler’s visit and the visit’s political implications, she agreed only when the Fuhrer, a self-confessed admirer of her work, convinced her that he wanted an artistic viewpoint in shooting the proceedings. In hindsight, it seems like a great decision, but it proved detrimental for the advancement of Riefenstahl’s career. She came to known as a Nazi pin-up girl and despite she breaking new ground in filming technique with every film, critics always ended up pointing out fascist tendencies in her work.Which is why, Triumph Of The Will is a significant film in the course of cinematic history. It covers up Hitler’s crimes so well, sealing once and for all, the ritual of German worship of their great dictator. But it also dug a coffin for its extremely talented film-maker, who is today credited for inventing and enhancing innovations like underwater photography.Parts of the film are certain to bore you - like the never-ending parades and the on-going orchestra, which forms the background score. But watching Hitler at the microphone is a weird experience - its a mix of amusement, admiration and hatred. That’s a feeling few men in the world can generate.

It's low on plot content, but that is compensated by the acting. With the brilliant costumes and design of sets, the 3D action makes this movie a must watch.","Kevin Flynn created a video game 20 years ago. His son Sam, finds out that the cyber universe that his father created has become much more than just a video game. Tron: Legacy has some superb action and the special effects are amazing too. I especially loved the design of the bikes and cars, and interior of buildings. Although the entire movie isn’t 3D, those sequences on the Grid, some of which lasted only a few moments, are spectacular and take the cake. The storyline is quite interesting if you don't know anything about the earlier Tron (1982). After watching the earlier version, the concepts are clearer and I could connect the dialogues better. So, if you haven’t seen Tron(1982) yet, I suggest you do your homework before you watch Tron Legacy. It is amazing how young Jeff Bridges (Clu) and Bruce Boxleitner (Tron) look! Bridges is fantastic in the film. He dominates, not because of more screen time which is given to him, but because of the powerful performance that he has brought in. Garrett Hedlund starts of very well, but his performance is overshadowed by other characters, as the movie proceeds. Olivia Wilde puts up a decent performance as Quorra, and looks great. Michael Sheen (David Frost of Frost/Nixon) does a small but admirable job with his cunning character, something that only he can pull off. The basic story is mediocre. It is quite uncomplicated and that makes me dislike the writers. The focus is clearly on the special effects, which more or less makes up for the other faults. The only disappointment, and big at that, are the non-action parts. The characters just sit around and talk, which made me impatient, almost bored. Also, a couple of sequences were ridiculous, and that there was no way something like this could logically happen even in a gaming world. Dramatizing did go a little over the top, but that can be dismissed in the end as a necessary evil.The film runs with a consistently different look throughout, but what is a gaming world which does not look peculaiar? Lack of colour deserves a huge thumbs up, it really makes the film look like it was shot in a different world. It's funny how much the gaming world is made to have human world aspects, for example emotions. Programs shouldn't understand anything but logic, right? But of course, I am making analogy to Star Trek – my bad. Costumes were amazing, and what with all the light! Camerawork is decent. Sound track is good, but even better is the sound and light harmony. And thank God there is no cyber romance.
No, this is not like Matrix, so don’t think too much. Enjoy the action and cyber universe, which is rich in music and entertaining. Watch for sure, in 3D if possible.

565,1265,1265,1265,1265,Tu Hai Mera Sunday,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review19 Critic Reviews 3.7/5.0,/movie/tu-hai-mera-sunday-review/,3.7/5.0,,,3.9,"A cute comment on everyday, urban life. Becomes a little 'out there', every once in a while. But so does everyday life, right? While the philosophising is a tad lame, the romantic bits are adorable.","Tu Hai Mera Sunday strings together many observations from every day life. In fact, you are taking a peek into just a few weeks of the lives of five men. This is done in a breezy manner. However, every once in a while it breaks into intense drama and/or philosophy. This break in the light breeze holds the film back. The film thankfully doesn't spend too much time on the history of the five lives, but we come to know these men reasonably well by the way they talk to each other and others around them. They are kept together by their weekly game of football. Their lives, individually held together by their Sunday football time.The writing has a lightness about it that hooks you in, even if you are not completely involved with the characters. Not only does it have organic, daily life humor even the flow of the stories is smooth. Through the film, you can see the comment on lack of space in urban life – physically and mentally. This philosophy of not “standing and caring” keeps a low profile and suddenly has an outburst and you can see through the cracks.You decipher the structure. The major religions/communities are represented through the characters. It is by design. At least two characters stay in areas that are dominantly populated by people from their community. One is a nice guy, one is a nice guy with a bad boy image, one is a nice guy but has angst filled within, one is a nice guy who wants to rebel, one is unhappily married. One has issues with his parents, one with his kids. One has trouble at work, one is comfortable in his skin. By the end, all but one of their stories are resolved nicely, without much ado. While this sounds formulaic and is too, to a large extent, there are charming subtleties. For instance one isn't aspirational – that's a rare trait for one of the main heroes of a story. Then, Tu Hai Mera Sunday does so well with its romantic scenes – maybe because they wouldn't necessarily qualify as romantic in the typical sense of the word. You sense the romance because the chemistry is obvious, not only to us as an audience, but to the two parties too. And we know they know and are trying to play it out so that it works out for them. These were my favourite bits in the film.A lot of Tu Hai Mera Sunday's charm lies in the hands of its performers. And they don't let the film down. So grounded are each of the performances, that as an afterthought I wondered if the characters were written so that the actors could be just themselves. If it were not for the overt philosophisation and dramatisation, Tu Hai Mera Sunday would have worked much better. But, the characters are a combination of what defines them as humans and what they would like to be. Which is why the dramatisation seems bizarre. In real life, we don't really become we really want to be in one sudden stroke, right?Also, such films feel like they come from a very personal space. A space that is so close to the writer/director's heart that the audience is kept at a distance, like a witness. As if they want to say, “what do you know about me or my life?” In that sense, it precludes judgment. This is not specific to Tu Hai Mera Sunday, but more about films with relatively smaller budgets, slice-of-life themes that are philosophical takes on life.

Much little acting, much little story. ","“Believe that the right thing will happen”, society's outlook towards people who are developmentally challenged, Gandhian values, futility of war, misdirected nationalism, judgements based on looks – these are the themes Tubelight goes over. All lofty, all preachily approached, all boring. The first thing you do when you see an adult with a developmental challenge is patronize him/her, right? Ok, a few ridicule them. Tubelight takes both the patronization and ridicule to a whole new level. When people laugh at him, the entire village laughs at him except for a handful (just one in one scene) who sympathize. When the village isn't around these sympathizers treat him like you wouldn't treat a five year old. The meta patronization is that the entire crew encouraged Salman Khan as he when around doing what he thought was acting. Sure, it can be argued that developmentally challenged people do believe whatever they are told and are rather innocent. But, what Laxman (Salman Khan) does in all his innocence is amusing if not outright annoying! The forced baby tone used by Salman Khan, especially in the voiceover is plain painful. Fortunately, you have Om Puri to bring a grounded feel to the performances even though he is preaching (because you know, he is a Gandhian). Matin Rey Tangu and Zhu Zhu bring about a calm by their presence. You might disagree with Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub's Narayan with as much he makes his argument, but he convinces you of his hate. Similarly, Sohail Khan, makes us believe that a straight face with expressive eyes are emotions enough for his character Bharat. I actually caught myself thinking, Sohail Khan should taken up more films as an actor. Hopefully, non-Salman films. Writing is to blame here as much as his performance though. An actor can look only as believable while mouthing a line, “Where can you find the strength of faith?” And that is his signature line. It is even more frustrating when the line is portrayed as “faith in self” but all the situations that test faith are actually testing hope and not self-belief. Similarly, you wonder what they are trying to do with the other issues the film raises. The main theme of the mental disability is botched completely. The other theme that runs thick through the film is that of judging people who look different. When the general attitude of characters in the film is that of ridicule or hatred, it is understandable. That is what the film wants to highlight. However, if the protagonist himself pokes fun at things like different-sounding names, it doesn't seem right. Especially, given what the film is trying to say otherwise about the situation.To add to the misery, the scenes drag. While thankfully slow-motion has been avoided, the other tool used to create drama – silences and pauses are way too long. Instead of adding to the intensity of the scene, they make you wait for it to make a move. The songs too add to the run-time almost making you wonder if the makers knew the material didn't have enough to hold attention. The music and lyrics are lacklustre and reminded me of the dreadful music from the 90s.It is strange that Tubelight has so many things to say and yet felt like it said nothing. I don't expect to be impacted by the manner in which issues are raised. But I expect the makers to at least try. It actually felt like, they thought what they saw on the paper had loads of mean, but when they got down to making the film, they lost faith.

567,1267,1267,1267,1267,Tuhya Dharma Koncha,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/tuhya-dharma-koncha-review/,,,,2.333333333,"Satish Manwar’s latest film, Tuhya Dharma Koncha?, while being a brave attempt at showing the suffering in the tribal regions of Maharashtra and questioning the importance of religion, doesn’t quite have enough of an emotional pull for it to truly make an impact. It is a noteworthy attempt, but one that is only moderately successful as a film.","After that little gem Gabhricha Paus, director Satish Manwar returns with Tuhya Dharma Koncha? (What’s your religion?), the story of a tribal family that lives in a little village on the fringes of the Tiger Reserve in Melghat. Despite the brave choice of story - an interesting and pertinent one by all means - the film is let down by poor production value and, more importantly by the lack of true emotional heft.Kavadu, a tribal villager, is arrested by the police for a crime he didn’t commit. While he is in jail, his wife Bhulabai, already encumbered with the responsibility of their two children, one of whom is an ailing infant, now also has to run from pillar to post trying to get Kavadu out. In dealing with these problems, she has to invariably turn to a band of Naxalites, and then to a Christian missionary priest for help. As the story progresses, the question that it invariably poses is the one asked in the title of the film.What immediately strikes you in Tuhya Dharma Koncha?? is the lack of production value. Obviously, budget constraints will always plague a film that genuinely tries to be different without catering to a mass audience. But with a largely static camera and groups of people like the villagers, the Naxals and the Christians numbering only in handfuls, the film ends up feeling more like theatre than cinema. The film also has a fairly flat graph throughout. You are always watching the suffering of a tribal family in rural Maharashtra, but it never escalates enough to grab at your throat. It always maintains a certain distance from the viewer. While the clear lack of attempt at infusing additional drama into the narrative is probably a directorial choice – indeed a mature one if that is the case – the fact remains that it fails to establish a strong emotional connect with the audience.The film is also very simplistic in its treatment of the groups I mentioned above. The Hindus, so clearly more consumed by rituals, festivals and tokenism than in any sort of progressive outlook; the Naxals with their one point militant communist agenda; the Christians with a more open outlook, derivative of the Western influences of the religion – each of these are painted in broad strokes, something that doesn’t really do justice to the complex socio-political situations that a melting pot of these groups would doubtlessly create. Also, the film doesn’t attempt to provide any sort of resolution to the important question that it asks in the title – again, a choice made by the filmmakers, but one that further underlines the fact that the film maintains a chasm between itself and the audience, who would want to take something away as food for thought from a film like this.The prime reason the film doesn’t completely fail in engaging the audience is the performance of the cast. Upendra Limaye, who plays Kavadu, is a fine actor. He does really well as he portrays the anguish of an innocent man locked up in prison. Vibhawari Deshpande as Bhulabai is convincing as the almost gullible but emotionally strong wife, who doesn’t hesitate in doing what needs to be done for the sake of her family. Kishor Kadam as the priest does a fair job as well, though his performances seem to very rarely differ from one another. Also, the entire cast as well as the director must be lauded for the use of the tribal Marathi dialect in the film. While that adds to the disconnect from the viewer to an extent, it can also actually aid in make you concentrate more to decipher them. (The film didn’t have subtitles at the hall where I watched it.)Director Satish Manwar is clearly a brave man who intends to continue telling stories about those parts of Maharashtra that are hidden by the cosmopolitanism and progress associated with the Pune – Mumbai – Nashik triangle. Indeed, most of us forget that a large part of Maharashtra remains one of the most under-developed areas in the country. So I do hope that Manwar continues making films that show the harshness of life in these regions. For his attempt alone, Tuhya Dharma Koncha? must be supported, even though the film largely remains a surface-level exploration of the role that religion plays at a time when no one religion can fulfill the needs of man, not one that attempts to delve too deep.

568,1268,1268,1268,1268,Tukaram,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/tukaram-review/,,5/5.0,,3.0,"The length and slow pace of the film notwithstanding, Chandrakant Kulkarni’s Tukaram has an ensemble cast that bring their characters alive, and has an authentic 17th century feel that manages to draw you in. Just for these reasons, Tukaram is a film that is worth a watch.","In spite of the fact that director Chandrakant Kulkarni has to his credit that guilty pleasure Bindhaast in his filmography, his latest film, Tukaram, didn’t spawn too many expectations for me, primarily because of the choice of actor to essay the role of one of the most respected and revered saints of Maharashtra. Jitendra Joshi, though not incompetent, has played too many character roles to really be taken seriously. However, his performance in Tukaram grows on you through the length of the film, ultimately leaving you with the feeling that he actually did a decent job.Young Tukaram Ambile is his parents’ second child, his older brother being more interested in the ways of God than in earthly life. Because of this, Tukaram shoulders the responsibility of his father’s money-lending and trading work fairly early. The film goes on to chronicle the journey of his life, leading up to how he comes to be the mass-popular poet-saint that history now knows him as. Right from the first frame of the film, the authentic feel and setting engulfs you. Not once does the film fall prey to ‘modern’ gimmickry in terms of technique. Even camera movements are gentle and stable, managing to draw attention to the detailing in the production design. The language and dialogue are an added bonus, contributing immensely in the audience vicariously experiencing life in 17th century Maharashtra.Undoubtedly, the strength of the film is its performances. As mentioned earlier, Jitendra Joshi manages to breathe life into the character of Tukaram, easily making you forget some of the more bizarre character choices he has made in the past. Prateeksha Lonkar, who plays Tukaram’s mother, is a joy to watch, like always. Not since Reema Lagoo in the Rajshri films of the 90s has someone made for such a warm screen mother. Sharad Ponkshe as Tukaram’s father is excellent as well, managing to switch between being a warm father and businessman with ease. Veena Jamkar and Radhika Apte, playing Tukaram’s first and second wives respectively, perform well. Apte, in particular, handles the graph of her character with finesse. Her gradual shift from being young and innocent to being mature and tough is truly exceptional.Yet, Tukaram is not without its flaws. Its most obvious problem is its length. Clocking in at two and three quarters of an hour, the film feels even longer because of its uneven, often slow, pace. Period biopics often find it tough to hold audience attention, and Tukaram falls prey to this as well. The pace slows even more in the latter half of the film, without truly contributing to the story of the saint’s life. However, the biggest problem with the film is the graph of Tukaram’s character. A human being is most malleable when he is a child and his formative years contribute most to how he is as an adult. Starting off in his childhood, the film abruptly cuts to him being a grown man, thus robbing the film of the impact that the initial reels could potentially have had. Furthermore, Tukaram’s adult life has two parts to it – one where he is a man with worldly needs and aspirations, and one where he has renounced materialism in favour of spreading, through his poetry, the word of God. The bridge between these two vastly different characters, the journey between these two extremes had the potential to be far stronger. While a lot of time has been spent detailing these two characters, the connecting link between them has essentially been condensed to just one scene. This scene, though impactful in isolation, is still not enough, not when the two characters are poles apart. Despite its flaws, the film in its entirety makes for an interesting experience. Facets of Tukaram’s life that aren’t popularly known are brought forth, and the manner in which the cast of the film brings credibility to the characters they play is truly noteworthy. Thus, though Tukaram is far too long for its own good and takes its time to unfold, it still makes for a decent watch because of the performances and the detailed and nuanced production design, which has clearly been worked on with love.

And I wonder where we have seen the story earlier? Hmmmm...,"Every other line that Shekhar (Aditya Seal) says has the word “life” in it. That is how much he philosophizes. Okay fine, I might be exaggerating a tad bit. But what could have been insightful, instead incites eyerolls. You have to give it to Tum Bin 2 for having two equally decent human beings as contenders for the lady in the love triangle. Else, it would have been very easy for the audience to have someone to root for. Unfortunately, this opportunity to engage is lost by a dull implementation of the concept. That aside, the most chemistry you see is that between two mourning people - a would be daughter-in-law and father-in-law. And this is supposed to be a romantic film. This is interesting considering that the characters are saying all the right things when they talk about romance. So in that sense some of the dialogue is good. But, it doesn't leave an impact.It is not like the performances are awful. Sure, they aren't the greatest but they aren't the kind that you usually get in films with this budget and this style of execution. Aditya Seal and Neha Sharma actually emote aptly. While the same cannot be said about Aashim Gulati, the rest of the supporting cast do well to keep things real. Given that the various departments of film are just about average but not below average, the culprit in pulling it down might as well be the pace. With a song at every turn, even if it is running in the background and not lip-synced, the film is quite slow. And of course, to make matters worse it is predictable. In fact, so much so that I placed a bet with myself – I will up the rating a notch if the interval point doesn't come where I think it will. This was 20 minutes into the film about an hour away from interval. I won. And just in case you are wondering, no I didn't have to change the rating. Of course, we shouldn't be waiting for the unexpected when the makers seem to have understood the word “sequel” as same-ish story with a different setting rather than “what comes next”. For an almost repeat show, the film is all about romance and remorse – intense emotions neither of which unfortunately touch a chord.

Its unexciting, its slow. But a strong lady character is good because its rare in Hindi films. Little solace that is, though.","I am one of those who believes that the same old story can be told with a fresh style and thus still entertain. Unfortunately the converse is also true. The same old story can be told in a dull, soporific style and bore you to the core. You know where I'm leading you with this one - Tum Mile falls in the second category - boring. The one line plot is as simple as it can be. Boy meets girl (as clarified in the title), they fall in love, something happens they fall out of it and the climax will tell you whether finally boy meets girl or not. Now within these confines the freshness could be in how they meet, how they start liking each other, what misunderstanding/personality clash is thrown in, etc. All these things are sort-of close to real-life. We are sure to know people and couples like these. But, here real also translates to hands-down monotonous. The situations are sorry enough, the dialogues attempt to add flavor but don't succeed very much. And in such state of affairs, how much can the actors do? Both Emraan Hashmi and Soha Ali Khan are delighted, sorry, shy, frustrated, helpless as the script requires them to be. All good but still mind-numbing. And the two of them create nothing special together. No longing in me for them to be together. No reason for me to feel good when they are all lovey-dovey, nor for me to feel pain when they are trying hard to keep those tears in. In all this mundane humdrum there is one thing that sticks out. The lead lady character has a personality that she stands by. She's not whimsical and neither does she have an obsessive compulsive disorder. She's a regular girl with her own aspirations and easy-going ways. She will bend backward for her man and snap every time her back protests. And yet I don't empathize with a girl or the boy who have come from South Africa for a day to Bombay and get stuck in the oh-so-rotten monsoons. It's nothing against the characters. It’s the way the entire episodes are narrated. So emotionless, so…so lifeless. Why should I care if they suffer like Rose did in Titanic? They couldn't create an ounce of what I felt for her. And that is very atypical of a Bhatt film. Whoever the director, there is enough of a twist in the story and enough interaction within the audience for them to react, to love, to hate. But, here I am sitting, bored even to finish writing this review. Nope, no good memorable tunes or lyrics in the songs either! :(

Why-o-why-o-why?","Like many themes converted to films, mechanical corporate sharks wanting to take over a warm, cozy place associated with a lot of emotions, is not new. But Tum Milo Toh Sahi makes a genuine effort to make it meaningful. The emotions are not superficial, you identify with the characters. And yet you are not rooting for the protagonists and neither do you want to take the ""wrong-doers"" to court.Tum Milo To Sahi is a little bit about a lot of things. The most obvious one is a comment on disregard to saving the country's heritage by both its government and citizens. The ""metropolitan corrupting small-town simple-mindedness"" take is hard to miss too. Then you have ambitious characters being judged as greedy and insensitive under the mask of westernization. Society's lack of sympathy towards an unmarried mother is frowned upon too. So much to say, so little time. And thus, everything is said in a rush and the audience can't engage in anything at all. You watch with interest but no involvement. And there are a few things to hold your interest in place almost till the end. Dimple Kapadia and Nana Patekar's acts are completely spell-binding. Dimple Kapadia, in fact, reminded me of her character in Saagar. Buoyant and sensitive, loud and thoughtful, street-smart and direct. Nana Patekar does his usual frustrated common man deal, and does it well. The rest of the actors though are completely out of the veterans' league, though. Especially the kid who over-acts notwithstanding his over-done Australian accent. I enjoyed the set-up in the beginning too. The camera-work and way of introducing characters was different and pleasant. Usually I get annoyed in a film with hardly any long shots. But, this one it didn't disturb me. Though I think I'd have grasped the characters better if I was shown their environment every once in a while. The story is also played out and connected between the numerous characters pretty well. Despite the predictability, the piecing together of the different sub-plots is fun to watch. But alas, all goes phut in the last 20 minutes. All logical reactions given their characters go for a complete toss losing head and tail. Characters transform like they attained nirvana overnight. And soon enough a nice film becomes eye-roll material. The lines are fun but only sporadically. The preachy ones are more than what one wants to hear for entertainment or education. However, the lyrics of the title song are a pleasant surprise, especially considering the other mediocre writing in the film. A comment on the vacant space in relationships and general human disconnect with each other is insightful. It's disheartening that the last 20 minutes can undo the work of the first 110 so badly. This one will make a decent-enough watch when the DVD is out or when it has a TV release. Till then, IPL??

And such a bummer that most of the ‘fun’ moments made it to the trailer. ,"Sulu is not a character you see too often in films. You can see the great deal of thought that has gone into writing the character. That is true for the other characters too. Unfortunately, the story meanders to the point of taking the entire film down with it, and along the way you have repetitive character traits and situations. So, Sulu (Vidya Balan) is chirpy and we see a lot of those in Hindi films. In fact, the other radio jockey in the film, Albeli Anjali (Malishka Mendonsa) who is the regular brand of chirpy we see in Hindi films shows you how different Sulu’s chirp is. Sulu differentiates herself because of the milieu she belongs to – the simplicity of a middle-class family. She makes tea for her family and wrings clothes out of her washing machine with the same spirit as she performs as a radio jockey. Her vigor and humor is indefatigable. She is so comfortable with her personality and sees perfect sense in the most impractical ideas she wants to follow through on. And yet she is more comfortable when she is by herself in the quiet of her day – you see the same content when she talks into the mic and has become oblivious to the people around her. For a person with a relatively conservative background, she is extremely non-judgmental. She thinks it is perfectly fine for her to take calls from horny men at a late night radio show, as a jockey. In fact, her charm and grounded attitude towards callers converts people who laugh at her to people who laugh with her. Sulu is no feminist. She is not struggling any more because she is a woman. Being a wife and mother to her son is a part of her being. Her relatively more-accomplished sisters (Sindhu Shekharan and Seema Taneja) are working women who put her down with their dad in an almost Cinderella-esque manner. They ask Sulu’s husband, Ashok (Manav Kaul), who is prince charming of his own kind, to talk sense into her. But, it still have nothing to do with feminism. Collectively, they are not upset because Sulu has taken up a job being a woman. They are not happy with the kind of job she is doing. Ashok begins to get bitter not because she is working but because she is talking to horny men in her sexiest voice. He is romantically jealous, not necessarily professionally so. And yet, the feminism comes through in the subtlest of forms when a passer-by woman police officer is dropping her child to school while asking him to make sure he eats well. Many characters who are not usually women are being performed by women in Tumhari Sulu - from the night-shift cab-driver (Trupti Khamkar) to the radio station’s head (Neha Dhupia) to the police officers on night duty and even the sisters who mentally harass Sulu – any of these roles could have been assigned to men and we wouldn’t bat an eye. But, women in these roles, made the film more feminist than it would have been if Sulu had to fight for her right to do the job she likes against a dominating husband or father. Objectification too is highlighted in an indirect way. At one end you have Sulu who is taking calls from men, who would most likely be calling because Sulu’s sultry voice makes them horny. At the other end you have Ashok who seems to be living a typical married life with a weekly/monthly limit on sex.  And at yet another end, you have their pre-teen son, Pranav (Abhishek Sharrma) who rents out adult magazines and CDs to his classmates. Tumhari Sulu doesn’t bother with making a value judgment of any of these, it just puts it out there. Note how you know so much about the side-characters. It is a shame then, that despite the warmth with which each character is written – even Ashok’s irate boss or the writer for Sulu’s radio programme (Vijay Maurya) – the story comes across as forced and relatively lame with of course, one of the weirdest resolutions in films. It is almost like the three broad departments of writing – story, characters and dialogue are different skill sets. It has always surprised me how realistically written and executed ambiance makes even the most ridiculous stories believable. The middle-class setting of a suburb on the outskirts of North Mumbai – with tiny houses which have living rooms that double up as dining rooms, that house families who consider Rs. 40,000 per month as a well-paying job – make you want to believe the ridiculous, fairy-tale like chance that Sulu gets to become a radio jockey. This is despite the low-income texture being forced down on you with close-ups of clothespins and cluttered sills. In fact, there were times when I thought the audience was being made to look down up on this setting with amusement as if the makers were writing an essay on – “the other life in urban suburbia: look at them, this is how they live” - middle-class porn of sorts.The songs that interrupt the story seem forced too. Except for one song, the rest come across as avoidable fillers. At its heart then, are the performances by one and all. Since, most of what you enjoy in Tumhari Sulu is the characters, it wouldn’t have worked out if it weren’t for able performances across the board. There is no way to know, relate and connect with the characters, to the point of being in tears in an otherwise comedy film, without the actors taking on their characters as their selves. Yes, I realise having one piddly paragraph for the actors when they have all done so well is not fair. But, words and more words praising each remarkable performance isn’t good enough either. The only way to do justice to performances of this caliber is to watch the film – if you can watch a film only for its characters and the performances, that is.

573,1273,1273,1273,1273,Turning 30!!!,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review36 Critic Reviews 1.3/5.0 56 Tweet Reviews 3.2/5.0,/movie/turning-30-review/,1.3/5.0,,3.2/5.0,3.166666667,"It's awesome that a film with a non-glam lady actor in the lead was produced. It brings greater joy that the story is about an everyday girl and she doesn't have some high profile job or boyfriend/husband. Alas, all of this becomes ""blah"" before you know it. What could have been a celebration of all things woman might just make all women turning 30 into a laughing stock. ","This is a country where the first attack of arthritis symbolizes aging. We dismissed my mom's menopause as random irritability. Making a big deal out of 'turning 30' is considered, at best, much ado about nothing. That does not make the problems facing the chic-urban-turning-30 any less important. Yes, they have it all, and they want more. And proudly so; even if they have to fight for it. In that sense Turning 30!!! could have been a very important film. But it turns out to be a drab narrative. You wait for the spark and you are kept waiting.I consider myself a part of the target audience, I'm city-bred, so what if I turned 30 a little while ago. I might not be as chic as her, but I have more than a friend or two who are like the women Turning 30!!! talks about. Yet Naina (Gul Panag) and her friends don't even remotely touch me. I'd have wanted to smile with their jokes, nod at their insights about love, life and everything that goes with it. I'd have loved to cry with them too, but I cringed after the first couple of times I saw Gul cry. There's only so much of a grown-up woman you can see crying, after all. The much talked about, and rightly so, Sex and The City hangover is as dreary and superficially profound as the original (go ahead, shoot me for killing your stereotype about all women liking SATC!) And yet, it wouldn't have been such a bore if it weren't so repetitive. Fortunately, the writer/director is very open about showing a woman's sexual urges. Hindi films have after all, always been too shy to express sensuality. That her lust goes hand-in-hand with how desperate her love gets is a slice-of-life for any woman in love - age no bar. I also liked the hand homosexuality is dealt. Right from how close friends initially react to their lesbian friend coming out to them to how the larger group reacts to how everyone comes to terms with it. Naina's struggle at work too is something that kept me going. It felt like the writer had some insight into a woman's aspirations at work; her frustrations with the macho men in her industry; and her struggle in getting what is rightfully hers. But, that too goes bust with a sorrily written climax. That's the story of the film's life. There were many things going right, but sooner or later, they go flat. 
Like a woman who's in her 60s is likely to say, celebrating or whining about a 30th is a thing-to-do by women who have it all and know nothing of real suffering and pain at the hands of their men. And this pain is physical versus the 'literal pain in the ass that her ex-boyfriend was', Naina is heard complaining about. But, that's for the 60-year old to say. We 30-Pluses had our chance and blew it.

574,1274,1274,1274,1274,Turtles Can Fly,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/turtles-can-fly-review/,,5/5.0,,3.166666667,"Turtles Can Fly will often make you want to use the fast forward button – but you won’t be able to because you’ll be so caught up in the lives of these children who live their life in Kurdish refugee camps. It’s heart-warming and horrifying at the same time. It’s a small story about a magnanimously large historical and political event. Ghobadi’s personal perspective comes in beautifully about his origin. Turtles Can Fly is colourful but painted on a black canvas; it’ll constantly remind you of the realities the film is based on. Watch with a strong heart, and an open sense of humour. ","Picture a smile creeping up your face; but you find yourself stopping it because what you want to smile about is a very serious matter. Mostly because you don’t even know what is making you smile. Immediately after that, you find yourself with a lumpy throat and wide, horrified eyes – viewing something that makes your gut wrench. This is an experience Bahman Ghobadi’s Turtles Can Fly will bring to you. A film set in a Kurdish Refugee camp, on the Turkish border of Iraq, graphs the everyday lives of children, before the US invasion, who have been living the atrocities of their limbo state. 
The film revolves around three main characters – Satellite (Sohran Ebrahim) the youngest authoritarian in the village - a boy who is most resourceful. He controls all the children who diffuses landmines with their bare hands and exchange them for machine guns in the local market. 
On the other hand, there’s brother-sister Agrin and Hyenkov, the calmest yet most affected children of the lot. Hyenkov has no hands; he uses his lips to diffuse the mines. Agrin is quiet throughout the film, but in her eyes you can virtually see the entire war. It’s a helpless, weak and desolate perspective which reminds you every minute how lucky you are to be only watching the film. 
More than loss of innocence, Turtles Can Fly also deals with a bunch of beautifully alarming paradoxes. For one, you can see the villagers and children looking forward to the US invasion because what they most desire is the fall of Saddam. Yet they call the land mines “American”. It’s almost hard to believe these children are teenagers, being equipped with such hard responsibilities and no security – yet you can see them making merry out of the little they have, walking around with one hand or one leg and smiling like there’s literally no tomorrow. Maybe it’s a distinct childlike quality or maybe it’s just their idea of living life king-size. 
Keeping the emotional overtone in the film aside, Turtles Can Fly uses beautiful imagery to juxtapose the horrid state of the people. The cinematography is detailed and colourful, incorporating the same sense of paradox that binds the film together. The performances of each child actor is natural and endearing, making you rightly believe that they are too busy trying to survive to have an opinion on the politics of the war. As an audience, it makes you realize how beautifully Iranian films are shot despite their controlled, government-funded budget.
Primary reason to pick up a Turtles Can Fly DVD is the interview with the same children from the film. It’s a non-professional cast and therefore the children mostly talk about their experience while filming. In these interviews, you can see a dripping innocence and a mischievous imprint of the children – the same quality which is lost in the film. The DVD also has a few extended theatrical trailers of the film.
The realities slap you in the face with every passing second but it also has a surreal after-ring to it. Turtles Can Fly is sprinkled with magical realism – you know it can’t get more real than this and yet there is a fantastic sense in their attitudes and lifestyle. 
This feeling is best expressed with one hard-hitting yet surreal scene- a baby tries to make a turtle drown in a small pond, and through the baby’s perspective you get an underwater shot of the turtle wading, almost flying around like there’s no worry in the world. You may just hear laughter at some point in the film – maybe of a child or maybe even your own – but it’s a laughter wrapped with a palpable sense of danger. Watch the film if you can watch turtles fly in spite of broken limbs.

The rest is as passable as it gets. ,"A Prabhu Deva film that doesn't flaunt his dancing skills. I am all for a film that is willing to offer anything that is not expected. Unfortunately, just because it is unexpected doesn't make it enjoyable. Tutak Tutak Tutiya showcases Prabhu Deva's acting chops alright, but is totally confused between being a horror, romantic and comedy film. In turn, you are just about amused by what's on, on-screen. What can you do but smile at a character who wants a “modern” woman for a wife? So, much for being modern, right? What can you do but breathe deeply when he swats a woman he doesn't want to date, shows interest? It's supposed to be a joke, slapstick, you see? What can you do but shrug because you have resolved to take a joke lightly?Thankfully, Tutak Tutak Tutiya doesn't stay with these things for too long and moves on to other things that make little sense. But, hey it is horror, there are ghosts. It has the license to not make sense. Given that, there is a lot of room to get creative. Especially when you have chosen to take the comedy route. Surprisingly, they do. There is one scene in which the ghost takes a different turn to harass the other characters. Within the context of Hindi films it is novel and amusing. Also, the CGI is pretty neat. The other surprise is in the form of Tamannaah Bhatia. She takes on her Jekyll and Hyde role pretty well. Even if, in those roles individually, she is expected to hold only one expression. It is still a relief from the plastic doll roles. Prabhu Deva on the other hand is alright when scared but is unconvincing when trying to be a snob. Then comes the resolution. The  mild interest that might have generated with the protagonist's dilemma - between being scared and helpless against a mean ghost and wanting to do right for the good person that his wife is - is squashed with the most ridiculous climax of them all. One last chance to amuse you with its silliness doesn't go vain. That's all I can say.

Pankaj Kapoor gives yet another excellent performance.","Very rarely in Hindi cinema can you say - no significant story, not everybody has acted well, but still go watch it. Every frame (well almost!) is enchanting. And the going is slow, so you have enough time to take in every detail. Yes, the movie is a fairy tale and is narrated as such. Melodrama is used where a parent would use exaggerated voice modulation to narrate the story. But, I still wouldn't call it a children's movie. It is very unlikely that the hues, the pace, or the subtle sense of humor are going to retain a child's attention. On the other hand, it is a very short movie and what a perfect way this would be to introduce the art that cinema is to children! And yes parents, there is a moral at the end of the story.The camerawork, both indoors and outdoors, is simply breathtaking. Himachal Pradesh's tourism department could very well use scenes from here to advertise its scenic beauty. Though the interiors are largely shot in the dark, the lighting and colors are used to beautify the scenes to perfection. A few scenes are shot from the point of view of a character or an object, allowing you to see what they/it are seeing - here the camera in combination with the background score has been used to enhance the emotion sought to be created (read more in the ""what worked"" section).  There were a few frames that were outright ugly, almost felt like they were shot by a different camera crew altogether. But, after a while, I noticed that such shots were used specifically for the darker characters. Maybe it wasn't intentional, but if the viewer feels obligated to rationalize the things they don't like, the director has done his job well, right?The simple story is complemented by simple music which is soft on the ears. The lyrics very appropriately followed a child's train of thoughts. Reminded me a lot of Gulzar's own 'lakdi ki kaathi' from Masoom - a song that I grew up listening to. The lyrics especially stood out when the umbrella, an inanimate object, was being spoken of as a lover.What stuck out as a sore thumb was the acting by all the side characters. In fact, the little girl's performance was also not up to mark. It was lifeless and flat. Pankaj Kapoor however, made up for all of it with brilliant body language. And this movie is more about the artistic representation of the subject, more than any individual performance. Though, the movie is about the characters, it is not a character driven script. Here I go rationalizing again!This movie is as much a trip to fantasy land as it is an experiment with the medium through creative use of camera, lighting, music and color. A work of art that is very rarely made available to the common movie-going population. So, catch it while it is still in the theaters, because a DVD might not do full justice to the overall effort.

With hardly any ""sad"" moments, the characters are mostly colorful and chirpy. But, given my reservations, should I actually encourage my kids to watch this when not too long ago Taare Zameen Par was around? Oh, why not? There's enough room for everybody.","thoda pyaar thoda magic is a crash course in moral science for second graders and below. And I'm pretty sure this target audience is going to thoroughly enjoy the lesson because it has song and dance, cartoons and naughtiness. So, parents can sit happy, because kids are taught animal rights, civic sense, love over war, forgiveness, importance of bonding over blood relations, being both a graceful winner and loser, religious tolerance all in a little over two hours. And I'm pretty sure there must be a couple I missed out on.You know what this means for the adults, right? One hell of a sappy movie! Over-idealistic to the hilt, and indigestibly sweet. I doubt even songs with underwater shots of a bikini-clad Ameesha Patel can compensate for that. In fact, that's a very high price to pay for tolerating the shrill character she plays. I know-I know, that's what the character demands, yada, yada. But, it hurts to watch the same excuse being used for Saif Ali Khan. He wears one sullen look throughout the movie despite being capable of very varied range of expressions. True, his character is very somber. But, the man just couldn't cry or make me feel for him in emotional scenes. Of course, blame is equally apportioned between his talent and the way the character develops.  The transformation from aloofness to bonding, from long silences to talking his heart out is a little too quick.Is it just me or does Rani Mukherjee really look and feel almost the same in most of her movies? It’s not like she isn't trying out different roles. Yet, somehow today while watching the movie I got this feeling of ""been there, seen that"". Maybe it has something to do with that extra layer of make-up they find necessary to apply to make her look fairer. Anyhow, something was amiss and everyone involved just felt like they were going through the motions.Also, while watching the movie today, I suddenly realized how my kids idolize RV and Shona, the characters Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukherjee play in Ta Ra Rum Pum. I can so visualize them now idolizing Ranbir and Geeta after watching this one. Does that mean when they grow up they are going to say, ""we grew up watching Saif or Rani who were in movies for kids like us"" just like we say today, ""we grew up watching Al Pacino or Amitabh Bachchan who made us wanna be like them.""  Scary, eh? If that's the onus they carry, they have to get better than this, because they are so capable of doing it. I digress. Coming back to the movie at hand, the dialogues and situations are pretty plain given that it's supposed to be about four really naughty kids. And the children enacting these roles are not super-adorable either. In a way it's nice to see regular kids playing regular kids. And it's better to have them do nothing compared to having them do the same old tricks that kids pull to harass adults. But that also means nothing really exciting is happening. Although some of the tributes given to various movies from yesteryears are cute. Also, the usual melodious and lively number from Kunal Kohli movies is missing here. Although I loved the way all of them were visualized. The choreography was bare minimum and the overall effect used was charming. The main problem though is we are in touch with a lot more cinema - Indian and foreign - compared to the generations before us ever were. So, obviously after this kind of exposure, it would be really difficult to spot something 'new' in terms of animation and special effects. The onus then completely lies in creatively utilizing these effects. And that the thoda pyaar thoda magic team manages to put together well. Yeah, things can appear and disappear, and inanimate stuff can dance, but how and when they do it is what counts, and that works pretty well here. The question remains - why don't we have movies that kids and adults can enjoy together?

It is sweet. The romance is too good to be true. Yet at some level it works, because the chemistry works. But, where's the ""hum"" Mr.Devgan? I saw only the ""U"". Why is the Mrs. denied character development? Of course, the U can argue that the movie is from Ajay's point of view. But then why behave like you are in love with cheese and call it, U Me Aur Hum?The story has a clear set-up, a conflict and a resolution. I like the pace at which the romance builds on the cruise ship as a tribute to Titanic. The conflict chosen however, is so specific that you wonder whether the resolution is applicable to all situations. Especially considering that Ajay Devgan, as a person, wants people to work on their relationships rather than let go.  Yet, it does manage to make you think ""how much would I be willing to give up in my relationship?""Again, the problem at hand is specific enough to warrant research. A cursory glance around the web raises a couple questions. To an extent, the movie is not about this specific issues, but is about the overall idea that love also means enjoying the blindness. But the issue is so much at the crux of the story that it can't be ignored.And why this obsession with a boy child? ""To each his own"" is all very good, but do we really need that kind of propaganda in such an influential medium? The issue of female infanticide is so rampant in India that this one doesn't even need research.Coming back to the romance, there is a lot of pretentious dialogue going back and forth, which is alright till Ashwani Dhir gets to sentences with ""repeated words"". He takes this scheme of sentence formation along with a joke to the other release this week Krazzy 4 too. So, we are repeating across movies too! Not to mentions that some of the key scenes lacked punch. But, there is this particular monologue which is getting tedious just when Ajay changes his tone completely and takes off. It touches the right chord. Yeah, the credit does go to Ajay Devgan for that. I have always felt that it's very difficult for a director to direct himself well. But when it comes to directing others, Ajay missed the mark. Almost everyone in the supporting cast is over-the-top. Of course, Kajol has done the best she can to get us involved with her situation despite the lack of depth writer, Ajay Devgan, etches out for her. Though she does get to her shrill self every once in a while. But I'm still miffed by the short hand she has been dealt.More credit to Ajay, this time with regard to experimenting with the camera. And of course to Aseem Bajaj for executing the director's vision. Most of the film is shot with the subject of the camera in the background. And some or the other out-of-focus object in the foreground - be it a chair, a person or a showpiece lying on the table that the subject is sitting behind. I found this interesting because I always had some inkling as to the evironment the character in focus is in.However, while Ajay and Kajol are stylish, elegant personalities, they are not the most beautiful looking people. Close-ups of their aging faces should be avoided, especially when they are playing characters 10 years younger than they are.Munna Dhiman does a decent job with the lyrics. The witty words flow well with the music and thus you don't have to strain too hard to understand. The music however, is just about functional. Despite all its flaws, U Me Aur Hum touches a tender spot, makes a tear roll, and sets you thinking about what love really means to you.

Udaan is the story of generations and generations conditioned into thinking that the suffocating expectations their parents endowed on them should be passed on as heritage, if not genetic code to their children. As if, entire lives were ancestral property or an old-old wristwatch - a super-conditional gift that comes with free emotional baggage.","'Failure', 'Red mark of the family', 'Good for nothing' (naalaayak), 'Disgraceful' - Many of us must have grown up (or are growing up) with these words being used, often, instead of your name. Of course, we didn’t enjoy it then or relish the memory now. Yet we wanted to be, neigh, needed to be in their good graces, irrespective of our definition of 'grace' or honor. Udaan is our life on screen. Even if you were one of many who boasted the 'best child of the universe' badge, you knew someone who was living through hell. You get the point? Watch it either way. :)Update: Theaters this weekend are shouting out to be booked and more. While Udaan touches the heart, Tere Bin Laden is some serious laughter magnet. Lamhaa loses out on novelty value and even more so in this august company.It's not like we haven't seen this story earlier. Amitabh Bachchan in Kabhie-Kabhie played Amit Malhotra who gave up his aspirations to be a poet and filled his father's shoes in the family business. Vicky rebelled against his dad in Sharaabi  for similar reasons. But in these films, this aspect was a backstory, a small part in the whole scheme. Udaan's beauty is that, this facet of humanity or lack thereof IS the story. And our story's hero, you and me is iconized by Rajat Barmecha. He's our suffering creative soul, Rohan Singh. The young debutant might not have a whole range of expressions at his disposal. But whatever he has, including his fresh, deep voice, is enough for a housefull theater to go, ""dude, no-no, don't do that you'll get caught"" or egging him to fight back against the arbitrary injustice. It could be Rajat's acting or the result of a strong narrative. Or it could just be the fact that we identify with him; or a combination of sorts. It could be his acting capabilities that gets the audience to cheer for Rohan when he slaps the wrong-doer. Or it could be the brilliant, arrogance portrayed by Ronit Roy; or the intolerable claustrophobia Ronit's character, B. Singh causes. All these elements work towards the goal of making a film with one powerful scene after the other. I watch an average of 6-8 movies a month, most of them in a theater. I can vouch that it ain't easy to get an ovation from people who have been in their seats for over 2 hours, watching a reasonably slow proceeding of events in a 17-year old boy's life. This despite, having two groups of dimwits cackling intermittently. This certainly wasn't because of what was on the screen, just bunch of inconsiderate film 'watchers'. This is relevant for an assessment of the film. Because in a serious film with strong sequences that are meant to develop both characters and relationship, it can be annoying and thus distracting to be interrupted by such hooting. And that the rest of us enjoyed the film despite this says a lot about the screenplay. The same reason applies to missing holes in the script. I wanted to know more about B. Singh. I am usually not the kind to demand too much backstory; I like the guessing and self-second-guessing. But here I needed a little more or maybe it's just that the everyday film has conditioned me into wanting a justification for the way things are. Me, the common man, needs a God to justify a part of how things work, and cannot accept the randomness of nature. Yep people, this is one of those films for which I'm ready to take blame for what I don't like. Anurag Kashyap, sir, your investment will bear fruit. If not immediately, consider it a part of buying during 'recession', this bud will blossom in the long-run. Not that you needed my reassurance, your product says it all.

Yes, that makes for a good film. ","Movies about drug abuse is not new to us. Affect of drug abuse and how it takes deep roots is not news either. You might or might not be surprised that this is rampant in Punjab. You might be taken aback by the influence even though the state is merely a stop to the drugs' ultimate destination. Yet, none of these can be the sole reason for Udta Punjab to suck you into its spiraling story. It is the confluence of a quirky narrative style, matching performances and the mood created by the camerawork, sound, editing, art direction – yes, pretty much the entire team.Sure, the narration uses editing as a very obvious tool to create connection between characters. Some times, it is a little too in the face, but at most other times it works to retain your attention. The intermingling of the stories itself works well as the unlikely dots connect in the last half  hour. Of course, each of the four protagonists are very obvious representations of the social strata they come from. Tommy Singh (Shahid Kapoor) is the local rockstar who is as expected full of himself. A nameless, petite lass (Alia Bhatt) represents the small village girl with huge aspirations who is just at all the wrong places at all the wrong times. She makes you wonder about the quantity and quality of inner strength a human being could possibly have. Sartaj Singh (Diljit Dosanjh)  is the quintessential corrupt cop with threadbare ethics. And Dr. Sahni (Kareena Kapoor) is the conscience of a deteriorating society who wants to set things right. Despite these stereotypical, more-or-less predictable descriptions, each of the characters has a little something in them which connects you to them – will to do good, remorse, need for redemption, fear of unknown, need to be fearless and more. Each character's actions and reactions are brought out perfectly by the actors. However, Alia Bhatt held the film together. It is as much the character and her situation, as it is the actor who absorbs all your attention, sympathy and goodwill. So much so that, it takes the light away from capable performances by each of the other actors, including Shahid Kapoor's madcap rockstar do, Kareena Kapoor's elegance and Diljit Dosanjh's quiet demeanour. Yet, it is these put together along with great contributions from each of the other departments that keep Udta Punjab from being yet another foul-mouthed, typical “Don't do drugs” film.

581,1281,1281,1281,1281,Ugly,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma reviewPreview31 Critic Reviews 4.0/5.0 5 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/ugly-review/,4.0/5.0,5/5.0,,4.5,The repulsion you feel towards Ugly is what makes it a good film. A thriller that makes you uncomfortable from within. ,"It is an ugly world out there, indeed. And it is not a world of under-world dons or glamorous stars - we are used to seeing the ugly sides of those worlds and pretty much know what to expect. It is that of people like (most of) us, who have seen bad times, very bad times - who at one point or another have considered a drastic step, an irrational one to relieve ourselves of our miseries. No relationship is spared, closest of bonds are questioned. Each character's selfishness is brought forth to your shock. Ugly never allows you a moment of comfort, and that's why the film is a well-made one. On the outside, Ugly is about a kidnapped 10-year old girl. About half an hour into the film, I wondered why Anurag Kashyap wrote an obnoxious, back-answering, over-smart girl who I didn't get involved with before she was kidnapped. He banks on the ""generic"" care you would have for any 10-year old girl who is kidnapped and worry on behalf of the parents. Later in the film, I wondered, is there one character I would feel my loyalties inclining towards? Nope. And that is exactly how the writer wants it. You don't like anyone at all. Who are you rooting for? But who do you root for in real life? Who do you like a 100%, a 100% of the time in real life?As the kidnapping itself takes a backseat, I was reminded of a question I have about death, ""how long does one mourn a close-one's death?"" A few days later, you have to move on with your life. After a point, that's how the characters seem to have dealt with the kidnapping. The unsaid conclusion seemed, ""If she were to be found, she'd be found by now. Since she hasn't been found yet, she must be dead. We should move on."" This seems so far removed from how you think you would react that it is shocking, disgusting. This emotion that was evoked is what makes Ugly a good film. In any other setting, with a set of different actors, Ugly would have felt like an exaggeration of dark characters. We are used to dark characters in a Anurag Kashyap film. We are used to seeing them devoid of glamor, but they usually do carry a style of their own. Here they are stripped off that. They seem so real, so possible that you accept their darkness as a part of them. They do have streaks of humanity in them, but they are either so stern (Ronit Roy as Bose) or so worn-out (Tejaswini Kolhapure as his wife) that  it is easy to accept them as empty of that humanity. In fact, another reason for Ugly to be a rare film is that the only people who seem to care is the police. Sure, their motivation is that it involves a senior's family, at one point they seem to be the only one's worried about the missing child. Watching their casual attitude turn into a serious one is a high point early in the film. The only one's doing their job and quite ruthlessly so. True to any Anurag Kashyap film the content, even if you don't like it, is so over-powering that the actors and their performances are taken for granted. Each one of us who sees the film could pick a different character and the actor who played it as the best, and each one of us would be right. I'd pick Girish Kulkarni who makes the inspector he plays his own and Rahul Bhatt as the struggling actor who wears his false pride on his sleeves as the ones who stay back with me. And of course there is gritty art work to go with the grim nature of the film and minimal to dramatic background music that only sets the tone deeper. While Mumbai lingers in the background, as the film proceeds, you might not hear it out loud but each frame seems to want to shout, ""mumbai, sapno ka shahar, jahaan koi kisi ka nahi"" - Mumbai, a city of dreams, where no relationship is sacrosanct.Also, true to any Anurag Kashyap film, it is not only about the unmasking of real people under the names of father, mother, friend, lover, but also about how rampant child kidnapping and trading is; how accepted prostitution is as a part of life; how casual an extra-marital affair is and so on. Yes, the other ugly things about life with a huge stamp of dark humor. The kind that feels unacceptable when its happening with you but brings out the laugh when it is happening to another. Exactly when does this disconnect happen?The film's content is so unsettling that you wouldn't want to watch it again, at the same time you feel like you haven't grasped it all in the first go. It is long and does seem to stall at places, over and above the lingering that is likeable. As well-made as I find a depressing film that shows you reality, I was ready to be out of the theater. After all, it does go out of its way to prove how deeply immoral we are as a society and as humans and after a point I don't want to be reminded that reality s***s. And at the same time, give me reality over gloss, any day!

As we find out in Ugly aur Pagli. The uneven pace kills this time.","Take any romantic relationship where one in the couple is more involved than the other. Then, exaggerate it - sometimes a bit, sometimes quite a bit, almost always slapsticky - and you have Ugly aur Pagli. Now this movie too could be a copy of/inspired by some movie or the other. But, how does it really matter - because it's a story about you and me anyway. So then, is it inspired by life in general? Maybe. Except that it has to be fit in 2 hours and in between 4 songs! And however realistically you present an idea, if you are going to rush in a story in the last 20 minutes it's not going to be digestible.What is love? How does a crush become more than just a crush? When does a very good friendship turn into romantic love? If you can do 'anything' to keep the other person happy, would that be defined as love? But then, wouldn't you do 'anything' to keep your closest friends happy? These are not the questions that Ugly aur Pagli makes you think about, for these are not new questions, by any means. But these are the questions that it tries to play out.They are played out by simpleton Kabir (Ranveer Shorey) who does the weirdest of things just in the hope that Kuhu (Malika Sherawat) will smile genuinely. He wants to reach out to the darkness that Kuhu hides almost successfully with her eccentric attitude towards him. She in turn, leaves no stone unturned in having him embarrass himself. All of this is wonderfully carried off on screen by both Ranveer and Mallika. Yep! Mallika too! Of course, she can't cry or take the load of an emotional scene yet, but she's believable when in prankster mode. And she did manage to pull off the scenes in which she's snoring and/or drunk. But, then again, the complexities of her character were hardly shown to us, they were just told by way of a voiceover.Ranveer is simply cast very well to play the good-for-nothing, unconditionally smitten guy-next-door. Though, I must say I was OD'ed on his voiceover by the end of it. It's just always there! True it's his point of view, but it would have been great if his expressions did some of the talking too.That's it! There are no other characters!! I always wondered how Hindi cinema has very few 'pure' romance movies. There's always some family, career, some exterior factor weighing in on the dynamics of the relationship. So, here you go. You have a movie just about the twosome. And it doesn't turn out too well, mainly because what happens between them in the first 5 minutes is repeated for the next hour and a half, albeit with occasional witty dialogue. There's one idiosyncratic, a little over-the-top episode after the other. Then, suddenly there's a rush for an actual story and it shows in the writing almost as an afterthought.The songs too seem like an afterthought. The songs are so out-of-tune with the rest of the movie that you can almost sense the director's awkwardness in having them in there. It saddens me to see an actor like Ranveer resorting to coordinating hands, legs and the ""look-in-the-moving camera"" in the name of dance. And this, just because the audience wants its heroes to dance. Oh, by the way, can anyone inform Mr. Anu Malik that changing his name to ""Aanuu"" in the credits is not 'the' change needed. It’s the music that needs to change! There are two things that I enjoyed though. One is the action sequences of the scripts that Kuhu writes. Although editing of the action doesn't let you actually get into the thick of things, just the stylization makes it worth watching. Especially because they are set around an otherwise low-budget movie. The other thing is the subtle tributes paid to movies of recent times, like Johnny Gaddar, Jaane tu..., Aamir, and I'm sure I must have missed a couple.Sure, Ugly aur Pagli is amusing at times, establishes one character really well, and has a raw appeal to it. But, then it has not-so-funny slapstick at other times, has a confused other character, and ruins the raw feel in the last twenty minutes.

Yes, you read that right – performance – she can actually act! It is a mystery why she deprived us of her talent all this while. Her expressive eyes could alone do most of the acting for her. Also she looks equally stunning and elegant both in the pastels and the few brighter costumes. Despite being at her best, emotions aroused by ten lines delivered by Aishwarya, can be kindled by just one movement of Shabana Azmi’s eyebrows. That is the prowess of this veteran’s acting. While Abhishek Bachchan looks a little unsettled in his first few scenes, he is sure to win some more hearts by the flavor he gives to the nawab’s character. All well and good, but be warned - it is a long, slow movie. A visual treat is laid out for you. Be it Aishwarya or Abhishek, be it the glittering costumes and jewelry or the ornate sets – everything is grand. The outstanding acting and the magnificent overall look lend to some outstanding Aishwarya-Abhishek scenes. While the original base story is retained, the screenplay is polished a bit, for the much needed clarifications in the plot. If only the producers had given a set run-time for the director/editor to stick to, the movie would have been appreciated better because – it is a long, slow movie. Anu Malik needs to be saluted just for the entirely different genre of music he has produced. The classical music and the meaningful lyrics are simple yet enjoyable. The use of contrast colours for background and Aishwarya’s attire add value to the overall picturisation of the songs. Vaibhavi Merchant’s choreography has the ‘Kajra re’ flavor and is gracefully rendered. It is a shame though that minimal Urdu is used – for the dialogues and the poetry – because this was the apt forum to bring the beautiful language to the younger generation. Maybe the strategy was to appeal to a bigger audience by avoiding the language. For mass appeal, my vote would go to reducing the length of the movie by a good 45 minutes. Difficult to leave out the fact – it is a long, slow movie. There are technical flaws. The definitions of ‘sher’ and ‘ghazal’ have not been adhered to in a few dialogues. Some side characters are not fully developed, like Umrao's friends played by Divya Dutta and Ayesha Jhulka, . The make-up, dubbing and dialogue delivery of some extras is so awful that you cannot stand them for the two lines they have. Anyway, everyone involved seemed to have a lot of time at hand. No wonder the extra leisurely walk through the life of a great poetess. Did I mention – it is a long, slow movie. As promised, no futile attempt at comparisons. J. P Dutta’s Umrao Jaan is simply a pleasure to look at, outlined by some great acting. And hey, it just might be worth it because you get more time in the theatre for the same price because it is a …. Yes! You got that right!

This movie is about the origins of the conflict between the Vampires and Werewolves (Lycans) and has nothing new to offer in terms of visuals, storyline, and special effects.  The first film Underworld appeared nearly five years ago, and it was all about watching Kate Beckinsale in smoking hot leather, beat the stuffing out of whomever.  This film unfortunately holds no such attractions.  The actors are old faithfuls who have appeared in the previous two Underworld movies, and they continue to reprise their roles.   Bill Nighy is the Vampire patriarch, all fancy brocaded jackets, blue irises, and a powdered pale face.  He believes that his dialogues should be earth shaking (or was that the director’s instructions?), and so makes sure he spits his words out and for effect tries to vibrate his jowls simultaneously.Rhona Mitra is comely enough as Sonja and Michael Sheen is sufficiently gaunt and expresses his tender emotions through his eyes (the viewer is alerted to this fact through another character, in case he or she missed it completely). 
Kate Beckinsale appears for two seconds at the end of the film since this film is a prequel and the story does not have her in it yet.   The rest of the cast have nothing much to do in the film: they look uninterested; in some shots of the prisons the extras (who play prisoners) look completely confused and befuddled.
(or was that just the touch of realism that this film demanded?)The film has the age old themes of forbidden love, the fight of the underdog against injustice (literally in this case, since dogs are descended from wolves!), and the climactic big fight.  The film is visually all grey and black and we have swordplay, acrobatic fights in the rain, lots of carnage with necks and limbs being sawed off with monotonous regularity, tomato juice blood, and hirsute werewolves aplenty.  But it is all been done before a thousand times and one just wants the whole thing to get over fast.  Unfortunately the screen play does not help; it makes sure that things are stretched till the limit of predictability until so called justice has been done to all the ingredients in the pot.  The film feels like the director has been given a job to do, a job which is as routine as pouring milk into a bowl of cereal and he has gone ahead and done it, without bothering to think too much about it.The production values are decent, the castle, the towers, and the cliffs look real enough, but the special effects at times with respect to the creatures, look bedraggled.  And that is ironic, considering that this prequel is directed by a gentleman who specializes in creature effects!This is a vapid film; one of those standardized products that studios are so good at fabricating, for an audience consisting of die hard fans.  The film is not able to beget a single lump in the throat, nor nary a tear in the eyes of the viewer.  One just sinks deeper into the seat and wonders how one has landed up watching it. Best avoided, unless one wants to pay up for a few yawns.

Especially, if there are new ideas, how much ever impractical they might be. And new, easily palatable solutions, which even more easily invoke activism is exactly what Ungli offers.The impressive thing about the writing is that it not only picks topics that you and I encounter on a day-to-day basis and provide its own style of solution. It goes a little beyond. It creates an intriguing character and gives the character a dilemma - a real dilemma that you can see him fighting within. That doesn't take away from the fact that the ""ungli activism"" episodes themselves are pretty well thought out. I especially enjoyed the rickshaw episode. No, not because it is closer to heart. Maybe a little because they picked an issue that involved civic sense. Maybe a little more because it was not against the usual suspects - politicians/law enforcement. Even a little more because they dared to point a finger at the not-so-rich class. But, the most because of the point in the story that it is done. And how, these facts - that the target is not the typical ones and not rich creates unforeseen complications. Also this triggers a change in the dynamics of the relationships between other characters.Such slight detail in writing is so rare in Hindi films, especially the mainstream films that I take delight in them. It comes as an icing on the cake, when the performances are mostly restrained and there's no melodrama. Of course, the whole ""angst"" bit does come across as dramatic at some points. But then again, I can see myself getting worked up as much, when I see a car halting in the middle of the road to drop someone off. Here, the issues were larger and the reasons too. Randeep Hooda, Emraan Hashmi, Angad Bedi and Neil Bhopalam all play their bits well and actually look like real people in the real world. Maybe that self-referencing line by Emraan Hashmi could've been avoided because it just reminds you of the actor rather than keep him character.On the other hand, I liked the fact that Neha Dhupia and Kangna Ranaut who came into the industry banking heavily or used heavily for their oomph-factor, are now slowly taking on non-glam avatars. Just that neither of them wore anything blingy was good enough too. I guess it was too  much to ask the makers to avoid an item number. Shraddha Kapoor trying to make a some point with her appearance as a bar dancer. An item number that doesn't even have her lip-sync one line properly while the man in the song does the honors. These things in the beginning of the film make you a little wary of what's to come. But as the movie proceeds, such annoying bits are kept at bay and you settle in. And you actually get involved. An engaging film Ungli is. But like observed in another film not too long ago, ""Human behavior and life doesn't change in 3 hours.""

586,1286,1286,1286,1286,Unstoppable,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma reviewNotepad2 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/unstoppable-review/,,4/5.0,,2.833333333,Its a simple story line. We know the stakes in the first ten minutes of the movie. We know who are the heroes who are going to pull it off. But the movie has its fair share of unpredictability and complications to keep you engaged and make this a thrill ride. Watch it for sure.,"Before I saw this movie, a fellow reviewer at wogma and a friend, said to me – “This looks like 'The Burning Train' all over again.” I had similar notions about the film and was not too excited about watching it. The promos gave away all the story there is – an unmanned train carrying  highly toxic inflammable chemicals for cargo is heading at a very high speed towards a densely populated area and someone has to stop it before it causes mass destruction. But as you watch the movie, whenever you begin to think it's all predictable and boring, the movie throws in some masterfully shot action sequences, or some complications that lead to change of plans. The movie excels in both these departments and the action sequences are good enough to give you a rush. The complications make you think of ways to overcome them. Most people in the theatre, were talking to each other while watching the movie, and for once, it didn't annoy me. For on more than one occasions, I did the same with my friends. We discussed strategies, “Why don't they do this instead?” or “They should try that!” I believe a movie has done its job well, when it gets the audience so engaged. More so, when in the movie, they eventually discuss and try out half the ideas that we were floating around in the theatre. It made the story believable (it is inspired by a true story after all) and made us feel involved. Admittedly, there are some loopholes and heroics that are not seen in real life. But hey, whats an action movie, without some heroics, right? The ending might not satisfy everyone and may make you feel a bit cheated. There has been a lot of chatter in discussion forums over the net, about the choice of actions they took in the movie, and how they could have been more effective. But if you keep an open mind that all actions to prevent a disaster have to be taken with the approval of bureaucratic people who try to play safe in such situations and the time crunch does not always bring out the best in people, you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie. Denzel Washington is good as ever in the role of veteran engineer who is close to retirement. Chris Pine does well in his role of a newly assigned conductor who is working out his family issues. How tragedy makes them friends, is again no rocket science, but executed well. The direction is flawless and is the life and soul of the movie. The train sequences have been shot so masterfully that it gives you plenty of edge-of-the-seat, breathtaking moments. The screenplay gets a bit off the course at times, but since they had little story to play around with; you don't feel it sticking out as a sore thumb. Dialogues are clichéd, straight from the old-school action films, but the action more than makes up for it. The background score is fantastic and gives a lot of depth to the action sequences. After the first fifteen minutes or so, the movie never hits a low. It's a thrill ride, with no unnecessary stunts or over-the-top action sequences, which makes it one of the best thriller movies in recent times. The lighter moments which make fun of bureaucracy are fun to watch too. Watch this for sure, preferably in theatre.

587,1287,1287,1287,1287,Up,Owner's Pride!,wogma review,/movie/up-review/,,,,2.833333333,Up is a charming tale of discovering that love like Baskin Robbins comes in different flavours. It is a superbly animated flick about an old cynical man finding a reason to live… and love.,"Every once in a while comes an animated film that makes you smile and wonder at the simplicity of the world that we once lived in as children. Disney Pixar’s Up is one such film. It tells the story of a widower Carl Fredricksen (voice of Jeremy Leary) and an eager beaver ‘wilderness explorer’ Russel (Jordan Nagai) who is dying to earn his batch for assisting the elderly.Harassed by real estate sharks and ordered by the court to go into a retirement home Fredricksen decides to take off… along with his house floating on helium balloons and keep a promise he made to his wife long ago. Little does he know that he isn’t alone! The poor wilderness explorer is right outside on his porch and the two unlikely companions begin their adventurous journey. The storyline of Up, as innovative as it sounds, and does tend to flag towards the end. In fact the last 15-20 odd minutes of the film almost drag as you know just what is about to happen. This predictability is the film’s most major flaw. For most part however, Up is the charming and lovely fairy tale that it is supposed to be. It is also at a very basic level a reminder of how one can get caught up in the everyday and the mundane only to forget the dreams one has been living for. Perhaps that is why the scene that you are most likely to love and associate with is the one where old Fredricksen hoists his house on helium balloons leaving behind a gloomy world that only runs behind materialistic possessions and lives in concrete jungles. Unsurprisingly the only friend the widower finds is a ten-something-year-old Russell, untouched by malice, hatred and greed. This is a theme that could’ve taken the film to a new level. However some tacky portions in the screenplay and very poor storytelling ruins the fun. These are also parts that resort to clichés and are portions that make you want to walk out of the movie hall. However if you forgive directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson for these parts, Up is a very, very fine film indeed. Is it better than Wall.E? If you have liked the animated robot flick the year before last chances are you will like this one just as much if not better. It is a film that you must take your kids to and more importantly watch it yourself. If nothing else, it might just make you chase the dream you’ve been putting away for another day.

And this is exactly what the film is about. Set in the sanitised world of airports and hotel rooms Up in the Air is a film that best reflects today’s youth and its aspirations. ","Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) loves his work. He travels all over the United States doing the dirty job of firing people for bosses who’d rather not face their employees on the D-day. Bingham lives out of a suitcase, engages in one-night stands, is on the road for over 250 days a year and refuses to get into any committed relationship. Life for the 40-something Bigham is about to change when two women (Natalie Keener and Alex) walk into his life, making question Bingham everything he has done and loved all along. Up In The Air has been nominated for six Academy awards including Best Picture, Best Director (for Jason Reitman) and Best Actor (for George Clooney). The film is based on the book by the same name and takes some liberties with the original plot. At its heart, the story of the book and the film remain the same -- they are both about a man living in the sanitised world of airports and hotel rooms. Up In The Air released in the US at a time when the country’s economy was down in the dumps. Perhaps it’s one of the reasons why this movie has garnered much critical acclaim. By taking up the sensitive theme of lay-offs, Up In The Air touches upon the cold nature of American capitalism. It also takes a look at a man who derives his sense of being from car rental cards, hotel keys and whose only aim in life is to touch 10 million frequent flyer miles. The mood of the film is quite like one of Clooney’s earlier films -- Michael Clayton. Only unlike Clayton, Bingham is no revolutionary. He is an ordinary man who is more than happy to tow the line and make some money in the bargain. What is it that makes him a hero then is what Up In The Air is all about. Over the years, George Clooney has experimented with varied roles -- his last film was a comedy called The Men who Stare at Goats -- and has shown that there is more to him than the Batman days of yore. But Clooney’s performances as a down and out man-next-door are the ones that are perhaps most convincing; Michael Clayton is a classic case in point. From the man who is seemingly in control of his life to a person who begins to question himself, George Clooney plays the role of Ryan Bingham more convincingly than anyone else you can imagine. Needless to say he holds the film together. The two women, Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick -- who have also earned nominations -- manage to hold their own too. Kendric who plays Clooney’s young coworker and an upstart out to change the world delivers a great performance.While Farminga has little to do, she is the one that provides the film and Clooney’s character a much-needed turning point. The hitch however is that the chain of events is somewhat predictable. This is a big downer though over all, Up In The Air is a movie you won’t mind owning on DVD and the keener ones could do by going to the cinema halls when it releases in India.

I'd blame the plain and predictable dialogue for this one.","'Life is more than fair' even if things don't actually turn out the way you'd like them. A beautiful thought, especially where many of us are competing in cynicism. But by the time you reach that conclusion with Utt Patang you are pretty bored with what's going. Because of repetition; because of jokes that might have worked well on paper, but didn't quite get there when delivered; because the lines that led up to the joke were as plain as they could get.And that's what is sad. Good gags getting murdered by mediocre writing or over/under-acting. Here at least, the performers do their job well. Sure, Vinay Pathak goes over-the-top when he plays Lucky, the underworld don obsessed by everything French - I told ya, it sounds funny, but isn't as funny to watch - we can hardly fault Vinay Pathak, it’s the way the character is written. Besides he does a wonderful job as Ram, though nothing we haven't seen earlier. (There's no particular agenda behind Vinay Pathak's double role, but I liked the choice of names for them - an obvious reference one of my favorite comedies, Golmaal.)While Saurabh Shukla too does his usual thing of being the round man who everyone can laugh at, I thoroughly enjoyed Mona Singh's performance. Her confused, zombie-like daze is just what a woman who has recently broken up would wear. Mahie Gill sticks out like a sore thumb in this milieu. Maybe it is her loud character, maybe bad make-up, maybe the off-dubbing or then again, maybe it's just plain bad acting. What works best is the way in which the film is put together. I'm not talking about the editing or the transitions, but the non-linear narration flows back and forth smoothly. And the beauty is that even after the audience has put together the pieces in order, the basic plot has potential to maintain attention. I always disproportionately like parts of films that fool me. In a couple of scenes I cringed at the repetition of dialogue, only to find out later that the redundancy had a strong reason. Unfortunately, none of this adds up to a film that entertains or enlightens or gets me to stand up for a character or slap one. It's one of those films that you'd watch if it happened to be playing while switching channels. Such a viewing might then seem just about fair.

The overall plot is uber-predictable. And how the film gets there is as mechanical as it can get.,"Munnabhai MBBS, Patch Adams, Anand are a few of the films that come to mind within the first few minutes of Vaada Raha. Ok, with a few changes here and there. And they don't use exactly the same tricks. But the deviation seems more like a formality.The first change is of course having a little boy as one of the protagonists. Which could have worked had he not been talking and thinking like an adult. I can imagine that a character his age, who's already going through a bad patch in life, would become a little too philosophical for his age. But seeing him use the same clichéd language as oldies with no creativity would, made me do just one thing - cringe.Given that, Dwij Yadav who plays the little boy, carries his cute self through the ups and downs of his days with aimless Dr. Duke (Bobby Deol). Unfortunately, doesn't look like he has learnt more about acting in this film. He's just done what he has done so far. This is the best I've seen Bobby Deol act. Yeah, it's not in a mean way that I say this. He actually emotes his anger and helplessness. Once that is done the rest is a cakewalk. More or less Nanhe Jaisalmer's team of cast and crew don't quite get us involved in vaada raha. Neither the adults nor the kids make us love or hate them. They are just going through the motions and so are you expected to do the drill as the audience - go, watch emotionlessly, get-up, go.

Serious adult drama with no histrionics.,"The film opens with black clouds roiling to a martial drum soundtrack and words appear on the screen indicating the historical period – Nazi Germany, 1944.  We then hear the sounds of soldiers / officers swearing an oath of loyalty to the Fuehrer, Adolph Hitler, which then fades out against the backdrop of the Nazi swastika.  These set the tone for what is to follow for the next two hours – a somber, sedate film which deals with a particularly interesting piece of German History during World War II.  With Tom Cruise playing the pivotal character, one expects the film to have its share of stunts and explosions. Allies beating the bad guy Germans and winning.  Hollywood has been no stranger to such films, with such sterling examples like The Dirty Dozen, The Great Escape and Force 10 from Navarone.  But no, this film is different.  What it does is to tell a story that involves dozens of assorted characters all of whom are drawn from the German army and have a common aim.  The plotting is complex, and in the first half an hour the film shifts between Africa, Russia, and Berlin and in the process introduces some of the key characters.  Tom Cruise plays Colonel Stauffenberg, a man dissatisfied with the state of affairs of the German nation.  Others soon appear: Kenneth Branagh as Major General Tresckow, Bill Nighy as General Olbricht, Tom Wilkinson as General Fromm, and Terence Stamp as Beck.  It takes some time for the screenplay to establish the main characters and their machinations, and then the plot begins to unfold.  Director Bryan Singer recreates the period meticulously, never does one get the feeling that an anomaly exists.  The sets are detailed: Hitler’s bunker, the offices of the German army, and the streets of Berlin are very well setup.  They look solid and very real and so do the uniforms.  In keeping with the fact that the characters are all senior officers in the German army, the acting is controlled, there are no “applause” provoking dialogues nor are there long declamations and pithy sayings.  The chief characters evince a quiet desperation as they go about their business; the strain is evident in the set of the jaw, the tightening of the mouth, or in some cases the innumerable cigarettes smoked.  The screenplay does not make us understand the motivations of the characters clearly; things are never stated upfront and blatantly.  One gets the feeling that what is being done is in the interest of the German nation, at the same time some characters come across as ambivalent, or as sheer opportunists.  This is an area that the screenplay struggles with: for the audience to identify and empathise with the characters, a degree of clarity as to their underlying motivation is necessary.  The pacing of the film is unhurried at first, it picks up once the main characters are introduced, and then slows down again towards the end.  The end is in that sense an anticlimax, most viewers have at least some passing knowledge of the events depicted.  At the end, the viewer is left with a sense of futility at the turn of events depicted; a futility born out of foolhardiness that prompted so many men to risk their life for what is at best a nebulous idea( as it appears in the film).To his credit, the director does manage to compel the attention of the viewer, in spite of the weighty script and the variegated characters.  What suffers is the character development, an inevitable fallout of their sheer number, and the fact that he had to focus on the star, Tom Cruise.  Cruise turns in a suitably restrained performance, his jaw line and his carriage point to the bottled up tensions within.  The rest of the cast is good; Bill Nighy plays the man who teeters on the edge of indecision with panache.  Kenneth Branagh and Terence Stamp are more than adequate in their all too brief roles.  Tom Wilkinson is all bluster and jowl as the fence sitter.  This is a film that avoids all manner of excess but it also is one that leaves the viewer wishing that it could have had more soul to it.

It is a slow yet charming watch. However, you could get lost in translation if you don't understand the language.","Simplicity always feels good. Maybe because it is earthly or maybe because the very essence is lack of exaggeration. Valu's charming simplicity, however, in combination with its repetitiveness makes it a good watch but only for the very patient. The most endearing part about Valu is its characters. And these characters add up to create the atmosphere of a village in the interiors of Maharashtra. The language has a strong dash of an every-day sense of humor. The rawness of the dialect adds to the overall appeal. But this could also keep it from being accessible to a larger audience. Unfortunately, the language that defines the characters shows only one facet of their personality and thus end up giving a one-dimensional feel to each character. And make them not-so-interesting once you get to know them. However, I cannot take away from the fact that each and every actor has played their role in an utmost convincing manner, making you laugh and understand the one point they are trying to make. Right from the politician's sidekicks to the middle-class government worker (Atul Kulkarni) - each one enjoyable in his/her own right. The screenplay takes its own sweet time in establishing these characters. And it has all the time in the world because there is no great story to narrate here. The baseline story is as one-line as it can get. The villagers want to get rid of a bull that has become a menace. But there are layers if you are interested in peeling them. Underlying the superficial ""nothing happening"" feel of the screenplay are a couple of strong themes.Something about the way this one line is narrated makes you think about human nature. Is every human just trying to find some excuse to blame for his/her misfortune? ""Is the bull really a menace?"" Nothing about its behavior on screen justifies the behavior of some of the villagers. There are three people in the village who don’t want the bull to go. Why are they the only ones who are seemingly content with their existence?Is the bull a metaphor for any argument concerning society - abortion, affirmative action? There are pros and there are cons. Or is the one-liner yet another representation of the mother of all metaphors - The system! Is the bull a metaphor for everything that deviates from normal behavior in the ""system""? Most people want to be rid of it, while a handful doesn't mind the co-existence. As you can see, I am not very good with metaphors. All I know is the director is trying to say a little more than the obvious. And I think that's the inherent beauty of metaphorical work. It's open to interpretation.Oh well, let's come back to what can be seen. The camera breathtakingly captures the curves of the rugged terrain. And in tandem, the actors are given a curving trajectory that gives the frames a captivating beauty. This is especially true in the scenes where the bull is being chased.  Yet, all this put together, Valu is only adorable and not necessarily a must watch for everyone. For people who can enjoy the language, maybe. But otherwise, without ""really good"" subtitles it might end up being quite tedious.

Unfortunately, only partial. And yet, Salmaniacs can rejoice!","Ancestral feud. Mutual hatred. Boy meets girl. And if that ain't enough, you have rom-com, song-dance sequences and comic relief. Those, as we all know, are the ingredients of the masala cocktail. They seem to be in almost the right proportion too. How much each element is allowed to marinate is where things go wrong. So, while it’s a go right ahead for ""Salmaniacs"", for others it's not a complete loss either.That could be because some masalaparameters are kept void, like a love triangle, a spy in the tribe, etc. But, if we really wanted to get into what could have been, there is a lot more that could've been straightened out for it to make a better mark with the audiences. For example, the comic element in the romantic thread distracted from the story big time. The sincerity of the lovers didn't reach us mainly due to the laughs the makers seek to generate. Then, there's the almost 3-hour length and the pace at which every elements of the story unfolds. While the introduction to various Rajahs and Sardars and their black, white and guess what…some gray characters takes up the first half, it isn't boring. For one the way the camera moves, pans and zooms, make you marvel at the terrain. Then the songs, especially Taali, is composed, sung, picturized (in a smallish tribal den), and choreographed to draw and keep your attention. At this point you are wondering about the story that is still waiting to be told and you see potential too. Welcome the second half. While the good things of the first half are nowhere to be seen, the plot leads you to some extremely involving conflicts and dilemmas. The politics between the British, the Rajputs and the commoners is intriguing. So, you don't really miss the enjoyable music, because there's something that keeps you hooked. Unfortunately, the pace at which it needs to be told now (in the hour that's left) is a challenge. And everything has to be resolved in a hurry, leaving way too many important questions unanswered. And it ends in the most disappointing fashion ever! At the end, it is like almost every Salman-starrer. More about him, the actor, than about his character. He plays the cool-dude only wearing Pindhari outfits (I've serious doubts any of the costumes were researched or authentic). His dad played by Mithun does his bit of being happy, full of valor and emotional in turns. The beautiful-but-plaster-of-Paris look of debutant Zarine Khan is interesting only because of the meat her character could potentially hold. Yes, a woman in an epic drama actually had a valuable role, but in the end it all collapses into the humdrum. How I wish, her actions were explained a little better and she was shown to have a brain of her own. Her dilemma between love and duty was worthy of some more detail. Because my time in the theater was spent smiling and waiting for interesting things to happen, it kept me interested. But once out, when I think about each element in the story that caught my fancy, I realized it wasn't developed further. They didn't take it to a conclusion, logical or otherwise. I'd still not trash it; it's a fair attempt to entertain, and manages to do that intermittently.

Yes, that isn't saying much in favor of the film.","It suffers from the usual trappings of a RGV film – loud background music, weird camera angles of props that make them look unnecessarily spooky, lots of slow-mo, awful performances. On the other hand though, we get regular breaks from each of the above. Ok, except for the awful performances. I would've added that the silver lining is that it has an intriguing story but you are never allowed to connect with the characters and the narration is not gripping enough to engage you otherwise. For one, whenever you could be a part of the plot, you are distanced. Discussions between characters are muted under loud music. You are left looking at characters animatedly moving their lips at each other with over-enthusiastic expressions. This doesn't happen just once or twice, but is a regular feature. Beyond that then, it is plotting and failings from both sides that make both Veerappan and the police officer look sinister. In fact, at times the police officer comes across as gruesome and manipulative. While this could be viewed as an attempt at striking a balance, the police officers are justified a little too often. Also, you never get too close to the details anyway.The funniest bit is I found myself giving Veerappan, the film a few marks because it wasn't as much of a disasterous two hours as I expected it to be. That unfortunately, isn't really speaking for the film now, is it?

595,1295,1295,1295,1295,Ventilator,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/ventilator-review/,,,,2.8,"Sappy melodrama overshadows hilarious one-liners by mono-dimensional, caricatured, character sketches.","It is always difficult to talk about a film when you like the concept especially because it deviates from the norm; but, it falls short on implementation. If the film falls back on the same type of stereotypes and exaggeration to drive home a point, it doesn't matter if the concept is new. It just feels like the setting has changed. This is what happens with Ventilator. Slapstick and toilet humor stays the same, only that it happens alongside a deathbed. So, there is some variation to go with the deathbed theme.A certain type of Marathi films, including the recent Jaundya Na Balasaheb, bank heavily on creating a village atmosphere and the characters that go along with it - villagers with a typical accent and who are peculiar in their own way. This feels heavily inspired by Pu. La. Deshpande's work, if I may say so at the cost of sounding blasphemous. It is now happening often enough for me to think that under the guise of “realistic” this has become a shortcut writing tool. It brings in the laughs, it makes the movie seem realistic. But it lacks depth on any count. Ventilator falls into the same type.Sure, the hospital setting and selfishness of people are distinguishing factors. But, it is too uni-dimensional. Even as each character has only one facet of their personality exposed, there is broader black-white brush stroke. Almost all villagers have their own agenda even when someone they know closely is dying and almost all city dwellers know better, care more and so on. Sure, some of the one-liners are way too funny. But, they are not cohesive, they don't bring the movie together. They look like something from a mimicry artist's script. In that sense then, the casting department has done a good job of finding apt mimicry artists. All the actors fit their characters well, making you laugh and cringe appropriately, annoying and exasperating you when needed, etc. Ashutosh Gowariker is almost playing himself too. He does alright, but whether he can really act will come forth only with more films. Interestingly enough probably one of the most seasoned actors of them all, Priyanka Chopra, playing herself, is the weakest actor, even if it is a cameo. It doesn't help that she has some all-time lame lines – a couple of line were as lame as some of the other dialogues in the film are hilarious. Anyway, the laughs dry out in the second hand as the mood turns sombre. Sermons take over that talk about the importance of a healthy relationship with your parent. The monologue in the climax is rather painful, the predictable melodrama that follows worsens things and makes the second half intolerable. Ventilator then becomes a film that can be enjoyed for its laughs in the first half and it can be appreciated for an attempt at a different theme. But beyond that the writing department doesn't take the characters, sub-plots, relationships any further. This makes the film just about bearable.

596,1296,1296,1296,1296,Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/vettaiyaadu-vilaiyaadu-review/,,5/5.0,,3.466666667,"Vettaiyadu Vilayadu translated in Tamil means Hunt and Play, which is a unique title for a film that I assumed could more suitably be called Hide and Seek (a more conventional title for a suspense thriller?). It’s a tad bit more indulgent as the details take their own time to reveal the killer, who is evidently playing with his victims. The murders are vile and the hunt then becomes even more frustrating. It’s an engaging film, even though one might not agree with certain choices. You will be hooked. ","Let me begin by saying Vettaiyadu Vilayadu is not Gautam Menon’s best work. Lauded for making content-heavy “different” films, Menon has a pressuring reputation to live up to. This 2006 film starring Kamal Hassan seems like a sequel to his hit film Kaakha Kaakha, with a similar theme of portraying the turbulences of a cop’s life. While I still think Minnale is his best film so far, Vettaiyadu Vilayadu is an enthralling watch because of its performances.Kamal Hassan plays a tough, brutal and courageous cop Raghavan, and his larger than life courageous persona is established in the first few scenes itself as he single-handed tackles a bunch of criminals. Hassan as Raghavan is the kind of cop through whom nothing can escape, and even though this is a stereotypical portrayal, you wouldn’t expect anything else coming from Hassan. Almost like seeing SRK play a passionate lover. The film carries forward as a series of murders take place in a similar manner – slitting throats, brutally disfiguring young women. Raghavan takes personal interest in the case as his colleague (played by Prakash Raj) Arogyaraj’s daughter Rani is one of the deceased victims. After a brilliant performance by Prakash Raj as a grief-stricken father. Here we see a similarity to Kaakha Kaakha, however since the flashback that follows is short it serves as merely an informatory scene. Interspersed with this, is Raghavan’s relationship with Aradhna (Jyothika), a girl he meets in his hotel. They have a mellow, engaging chemistry in the film, and Jyothika’s de-glam avatar brings out her beauty like never before. You get suitably engrossed in their conversations and it serves as a respite to the fast-paced on goings in the film.Uptil this point, you are thoroughly gripped to the film: calculating your guesses and being cynical trying to figure out who among the people around Raghavan could really be the killer (you’ve seen enough thrillers to know the killer is always someone you knew and saw through the film). However, halfway through the film the killer is revealed and simply put, you are disappointed. I won’t say who or where, but I kept wondering if I was more disappointed with the choice of villain, or whether it was revealed much too early in the film. The thrilling chase then between Raghavan and the killer becomes predictable and largely one-dimensional. You know exactly how the climax is going to be, and at times the predictability gets to you as a viewer, but you are easily distracted by Hassan’s screen presence. With all his muscle (some fat too) his brute, over-powering presence convinces you of the scenes nonetheless. Mostly you can’t take your eyes off him. The DVD of the film only has a separate compilation of the songs in the film and no other additional features. Music is a trademark pathway to success in most Gautam Menon films; however the music of Vettaiyadu Vilayadu by Harris Jayaraj is mostly confusing – it’s neither here nor there with its assortment of overtly westernized beats and traditional melodies to culturally relevant lyrics. This is quite a pity because the Jayaraj-Menon combination has worked extremely well in the past (Kaakha Kaakha and Minnale). I’ve always held the notion that Gautam Menon’s films don’t age particularly well because it focuses too much on what is considered to be current and contemporary: be it the background score/music, dialogues or structure. It would have been a better film had it stuck to the age-old tried and tested structure of a murder-suspense. Watch Vettaiyadu Vilayadu however, not because you want to be blown out of your mind but because the film has its moments; best manifested in Jyothika and Kamal Hassan’s connection and the performances. It makes for a perfect late-night indulgence film.

And had a smile on my face for the next few minutes. Nope! Even the most easily amused can't term this one a comedy. I am just kicked by how the audience is taken for a ride. It's not a super-fun ride because by no means is it a great cinematic experience or an entertainer. It's just a smart concept that didn't manage to keep me hooked. In the interest of sounding a little less abstract and yet be truthful to the theme of this blog, I'm going to use an analogy. Say, you are a teacher who's going to introduce a new topic to the class today. To make the lesson more interesting you choose to play a game. Now the idea of playing a game is really neat, but, BUT if you choose a boring game, you have lost your class. Your creativity is admirable, but the class is not engaged. So, the idea of playing a game here is the broad concept of Via Darjeeling and I'm going to call the choice of game, the basic story. The conversation between a bunch of people discussing an event can only be as interesting as the event. As a character points out, this discussion could have been a classic study of human nature. But it's not, because the basic premise is lame. The story is somewhat saved by the ever-reliable Kay Kay Menon. The subtle changes in his character as he moves from one part of the movie to the next, are absolutely attributable to his performance. You can actually see some of it in Parvin Dabas' act too. Sonali Kulkarni's hammed up performance can also be passed off under the guise of her character's eccentricity and ambiguity. But, the entire set-up of friends talking, having fun, quibbling with each other, came off as extremely superficial. If one relationship oozed with extreme familiarity at one point, in the next, the same characters would be saying things to each other that made them seem like strangers. There's only fleeting interplay amongst the characters.So, while the individual characters were detailed, the relationships were very broadly sketched. And we are talking about the likes of Vinay Pathak, Rajat Kapoor, Sandhya Mridul, Prroshant Narayanan here. I have liked their work in one movie or the other, so am not willing to blame them completely for lack of the proverbial chemistry. Compound that with the overall drawling tone of the movie and you can't be blamed for getting a wee bit fidgety. And if that wasn't enough, the songs are absolutely misplaced, and don't go with the ambiance created by the movie. Yet, the director cannot be written off, because he tried. Tried something not ventured into easily by Hindi cinema - a story without a closure. There's after all no conflict that needs resolution. And trying out gets brownie points around here. Along the way, he also commented on the basic nature of humans to indulge themselves in something that doesn't concern them whatsoever. And though it doesn't hook the audience, it surely teases them right through to the end.

598,1298,1298,1298,1298,Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/vicky-cristina-barcelona-review/,,,,2.733333333,"In an interview with Woody Allen about the film, the interviewer asks him if, after trying to explore relationships in most of his films, he has found an answer. Allen replies, “I haven’t found any answers that you would want to hear”. The answer is more apt to the film than his personal life, where it doesn’t matter what you draw out of your experience of meeting a certain individual or indulging in an event/situation. What matters is how you chose to go about the experience and whether you could milk the most out of it before jumping to an “informed conclusion”. As a film, Vicky Cristina Barcelona does exactly that. ","Has it ever happened that you overhear a strange conversation, and somehow even though it defies every sense of logic, the words make absolute sense to you? For example, “We are meant for each other and not meant for each other. It’s a contradiction”. I know you understand that line – and Woody Allen knows it too. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is one such film that helps us understand that we are not alone in our chasms of strange thought. As the Woody Allen norm goes, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a character heavy-film. It stands apart from his regular treatment of films, however, because the mood and tone is not portrayed with neurotic dialogues but with scenic surroundings that lend its flavour to the spirit of the film. In this film, Allen has used Barcelona and the Spanish country-side as an additional character, lending its own perspective. The film begins with two friends, Vicky and Cristina, who are on a holiday in Barcelona. They are complete opposites – while Vicky (Rebecca Hall) is disciplined and organized, Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) is more the free-spirit. On a whim, they decide to take upon Juan Antonio’s (Javier Bardem, who plays a local painter) offer of joining him on a weekend of self-indulgence (wine, conversation and hours of going-with-the-flow). Through their journey and interactions, we see  their extravagances and their restraints, their discoveries and their ignorance. All come into being through a concoction of mood-setting (lighting and landscape cinematography), performances that depend more on gaze and facial expression than dialogue and that beautiful flamenco background music that gives a sense of freedom. A free-spirit that Allen as the director has allowed the characters to experience through the film.The film picks pace with the entry of Juan Antonio’s ex-wife Maria Elena (Penélope Cruz). Maria Elena as a character is a bit of a contradiction – she’s easily the most neurotic of the lot, and yet her silence conveys much more than her words. There is a scene in the film, taken from a top angle, which shows her furiously working on a canvas, wearing a torn piece of cloth to cover her. She moves from one stroke to another with absolute silent passion. To me, that scene describes her character best, and makes it apparent that by virtue of mere presence, she’s the star of the film.The film’s high point is in its interactions; be it a singular character’s interactions with the city and its visuals, their interactions with art or photography, or their interactions with one another. Each one lends a different perspective to you as a viewer and Allen knows exactly when to include words/dialogue to seal the scene – like a perfect package that leaves an ever-lasting imprint in your head. The DVD of Vicky Cristina Barcelona doesn’t have any extras, but I can tell you that you don’t need any. Calling it a sensual film that explores the various possibilities of the visual medium would be an understatement. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is plays out on itself – it’s a film that has its own education, where the characters indulge, discover, learn and portray. Surely you’d want to be a part of such an education.

599,1299,1299,1299,1299,Vicky Donor,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma reviewPreview40 Critic Reviews 4.8/5.0 14 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/vicky-donor-review/,4.8/5.0,5/5.0,,4.566666667,"Vicky Donor has a story which weaves in and out of a subject that is taboo, that too in an enjoyable and entertaining manner. Quick, witty lines are delivered with comfort and awesome performances. Even if you don't end up watching it on screen, do make sure you catch it on TV/DVD. ","If we are lucky enough to have a potential Hrishikesh Mukherjee amongst us, it would have to be Shoojit Sircar. Vicky Donor made me laugh, brought a tear to my eye, made me think, and it made me care about its characters - all in a setting we could accept as real-life. And it's not like the film doesn't have a good share of quirky characters (We have a whisky drinking granny, for goodness' sake!) but their quirks are made to look like they could easily belong to a neighbor's family, if not your own. For a subject as taboo and giggle-inducing as 'sperm donation', Vicky Donor does an awesome job of making it so regular even though the terms thrown at you are on-the-face. Each time Anu Kapoor says 'sperm' with a hand-gesture it makes you laugh out loud, right till the end. That's how good his comic timing is - that a signature phrase and symbol assigned to a character makes you laugh despite the repetition. Also, that's how good the writing is - because the time passed between two repetitions is just right and the things that come between them is either hilarious or entertaining, if not both. Yes, there is some non-hilarious entertainment. The drama and the romance are both engaging. After a really long time, I didn't have any problem believing a couple when they said they loved each other. Otherwise, either it is said too early, or one is blind to the other's love, or it is too mushy, or the lines are ridiculously shallow. Vicky Donor gets the romance 'Goldilocks' perfect.Same goes for the drama. This coming from a member of the audience who thinks she's has had just about enough of loud Punjabi characters and dialogue thrown at her. Beeji (Kamlesh Gill), Dolly (Dolly Ahluwalia) and the daughter-in-law-mother-in-law chemistry between them isn't something we are going to forget in a hurry and yet will want to revisit them every once in a while. I like Ayushman Khurana - even beyond his dimples. He has an easy-going screen presence that any actor should be proud of. His easy-go-lucky Punjabi munda mannerism is so casual that it is difficult to imagine him as any other character. I guess we'll have to wait for his next for that. Yami Gautam has a sweet charm that makes you reach out to the sadness within her when she's smiling, comfort her when she's obviously sad and identify with her PMS-ing shrill yelling when she's angry. Each character has depth and warmth - even the pushy Dr. Chaddha (Anu Kapoor) and his alter ego in the form of his assistant. Ashima's (Yami Gautam) dad and aunt add their own flavor to the mix - especially the scenes written between father and daughter. The extent to a dad can go to convince his daughter of anything - from choice of husband to how she's being silly in being upset with her husband - might seem outlandish, but we've all seen or heard of similar stuff in real-life.The screenplay is intriguing too. It is rather obviously episodic, it has five clear parts. The first which is covered in the promos where Dr. Chaddha is trying to convince Vicky to donate his sperm. Then you have Vicky wooing Ashima followed by an amazingly witty coverage of inter-caste marriage - a subject covered to death by Hindi cinema. The second half sombers up to cover more serious issues and the entire do has a clean albeit slightly mushy wrap-up. And in the midst of all this, you have a social message that never becomes preachy and will thus be effective, when a family faces an issue like this. After walking out of the theater, the superficial thoughts are that of having had fun for the last two hours, of having watched a good film. But half an hour later, when you have processed the film as a whole, I realized I liked it even more than I thought. And it is primarily because of this - Vicky Donor has so many elements that I thought I've had enough of and would've very grudgingly given benefit of doubt to any filmmaker or writer to cover even one of them with any freshness. But boy-meets-girl, Punjabi madness, repetitive dialogue/phrases, caste-based family issues, post-marital woes and recovery from them - Vicky Donor covers them all with a smile on its face and mine. It could be because it has a novel concept to tie this all in. Who would've thought that could happen?wogma and Bollywood and Fashion present the Vicky Donor contest. Tell us how you'd react if you are told that your friend is a Vicky donor and win filmy t-shirts!

The ball is made to bounce like a yo-yo on an extremely flat pitch. But, the good news is Hurman has begun to act!","I love watching cricket. I love our batsmen. I love the veterans as much as the new blood. I love our spinners, and I love our pace bowlers. I love our fielding when we do it and abuse the misfielding more often than not. And yet I cannot make myself watch the rerun of a match. Even if we have won. Even if my favorite batsman has scored a century. Even if a bowler has broken a world record. Well, what can I say, I am that kind of a cricket-fan. Imagine my plight when I watch an entire movie match, where I know not only the result (duh! The name of the movie is 'Victory!!), but also know it ball-by-ball. Yes, it is that predictable!!Sure, the scriptwriting textbook says have a set-up, a conflict, and a resolution. But these guys seem to have taken it a tad too seriously. Each act is build up to a limit where even a novice in movie-watching can forecast the next step and the two after that. The same goes for the lame lines given to one and all. I agree we are a cricket-crazy country. But repeating - once every 5 minutes - how the entire nation, ONE BILLION of us are looking up at/down upon a cricketer or are excited about/disappointed with an outcome becomes just too much to handle.Considering the overall issues with the writing department, the actors have done one helluva job! Hurman Baweja has certainly come a long, long way from Love Story 2050. He can actually cry convincingly. Very few male leads manage to not look like comedians when they do that. Amrita Rao is comfortable in her usual homely, warm character. Though here she occasionally bursts into the inner voice of different characters and brings them to their senses. But, I really want to see her do something different. Wouldn't she want that too? Anupam Kher, of course, makes the most of lines that have we've heard over and over again in the past few decades. The pride of a father, the stoop in his shoulder, the agony, the anger, the frustration can only be credited to his years of experience.Its not like predictability is a sin. O-kay it is. But not an unforgivable one. But there have been movies which are beautiful despite committing that one. This one is not. Maybe, just maybe, it might have worked if it was an hour shorter. Or maybe not.

601,1301,1301,1301,1301,Videsh,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma reviewNotepad26 Critic Reviews 1.9/5.0,/movie/videsh-review/,1.9/5.0,,,3.6,Preity's brilliant act & Deepa's execution play with gray cells. An out-of-the-box approach to domestic violence and superstition in the form of symbolism is thrown in too.,"Domestic violence and women’s empowerment would be the superficial issues that Videsh touches upon. Though these are by no means trivial, there are several deeper matters the film also tries to talk about. There's reference to the fact that strength of human willpower is generally under-rated. But one's strength doesn't necessarily have to be just willpower or intelligence or courage; it can be a subtler and a more abstract human capability. True - physical, verbal and thus mental abuse by different members of the family do make the marriage shown here incomparable to an average marriage. But the incompatibility between expectations and realities of a marriage are true of any marriage.  Preity Zinta gives the character, Chand, her vulnerability and her strength, her fear and her defiance. I can watch Videsh a few more times just to appreciate the nuances of her deglamorized performance. Vansh Bhardwaj plays her husband Rocky and does an equally laudable show. Given these acts and how well-thought the film is, it's difficult to imagine that the wooden expressions worn by the rest of the cast are unintentional. The glaring non-performances must have a reason I haven't been able to figure out. If nothing else, the indifferent faces effectively add to Chand's loneliness. This feeling of being alone while in company is magnified by the use of silence and of poetic prose in Chand's dialogues. Her disintegration due to her circumstances are a product of Rocky's aversion to talking - which means a wise non-usage of words to build his character. His silence frustrates us as an audience and sort-of makes us feel his frustration though we are not aware of the specifics. Then you have references to the Almighty and His influence on our lives is something that irks me often because of the kitschy way it is done in Hindi films. And in general, unless the plot's underlying assumption is the supernatural phenomenon, it works against the film. But, here in its quirky way, Videsh uses these things to represent the moral support and the liberation Chand feels. It also added to the heavy cynicism apparent in the title of the film Videsh - Heaven on Earth. A foreign land where Indians will do anything to go, but will end up creating anything but heaven there. And yet I feel something other than magical intervention would have worked much better as a symbol. The eerie close-ups, the slightly annoying handheld camera work, the unsettling silence due to the lack of background music, all add to the claustrophobic atmosphere Chand must experience in the ""free"" Western world. None of the outwardly issues touched upon have anything new about them - an abusive family, sarcasm at Indians' attempt to create India outside India, human crassness, strength of women, etc. But the philosophical bent given to the movie makes it far more superior to any other movie in this genre.

It might not convert you, but you’ll get it. The cult film, also known as VTV, and A. R. Rahman’s first project after the Oscar hype, is a beautiful, uncomplicated love story between people from different religions. You might find the plot a little too simple, you might not agree with the outcome – but the beauty of VTV lies in its ability to suck you in and make you understand the plight of the characters. Karthik (Silambarasan) and Jessie (Trisha Krishnan) live in different floors of a two-storied house in Chennai. Jessie is a tradition Christian girl, who wouldn’t dream of being even slightly rebellious. Karthik is a mediocre guy, who has ambitious plans of becoming a filmmaker. Gautam Menon doesn’t take much time in establishing the blazing chemistry between the two; being opposites yet having a strong pull towards one another. Ofcouse, there’s a conflict. She belongs to a strict Christian household, and she’s absolutely sure they have no future. And predictably so – Karthik doesn’t sit back. He pursues her, and he makes her fall in love with him. Typical filmy material right? Wrong. Menon spins his own visual spool to explain the love to us – mostly through Kathik’s thoughts manifested in dance sequences and surreal love-struck conversations with himself.  Thought bubbles keep running through your mind. Why can’t they just get together or why is Karthik so persistent about Jessie? We see Jessie through his eyes – she becomes the audience’s muse as well, and so when he continuously asks himself, “Of all the girls, why did I have to fall in love with Jessie” – there are no answers provided but you know why. Rahman’s music has a contemporary sound in the film – with echoes, choruses and thin voices - the songs become like melodic thoughts, be it the infatuated 'Hosanna', or the deeply lyrical 'Mannipaya'. The songs become a space for each character to sing out their stream of consciousness. The credit for this goes to Menon, for being able to use Rahman’s music and Thamarai (lyricist) words to capture the character’s contemplation and make it into a visual narrative of soulful melodies. The DVD of Vinnaithandi Varuvaya has no special features as such – but a good set of comprehensive subtitles and thankfully no loss in quality, because the film should be enjoyed for the visual treat that makes us fall, rise and celebrate the love being portrayed in the film.The best part about VTV however, is not the portrayal of love but in its ability to make you observe a positive angle through the struggle of love. VTV is as much a story of the frustrations and rejections  - but you empathize and relate with the characters without that dash of misogyny that most story-tellers might tend to use. That’s where Menon’s vision needs to be applauded, to be able to present a well-rounded story and make it strikingly about the love, the visual memories, and the characters and less about the struggle. The frustration is treated as a skipping stone in the trajectory of love. Eventually, as they toil to cross seas or skies for their love – they manage to draw a pretty darn good picture of it.

The film itself is a very average action flick attracting attention only because of Kamal Haasan. All Vishwaroop wants to say is, ""My name is Khan, and I'm not a terrorist."" His character that is. ","Two disclaimers - I saw the Hindi version. I have never been a Kamal Haasan fan.It has been ages since I've seen a Kamal Haasan film. The only reason I chose to watch the film was the ban - my way of showing support. I had decided to watch the film even if the Hindi version wasn't playing in a theater close to me. Even if I didn't understand a word. Fortunately, there was a Hindi version I could catch. Only for me to find out how much sillier the ban is than I originally thought it was. The only group of people it speaks against is the Taliban/Jihadis/Mujahiddins. So, did I get this right? Making this group of people out as villains hurts sentiments? Whose? Vishwaroop is a very average action flick at best and shouldn't be considered any more than that. I have never enjoyed Kamal Haasan's histrionics. He has always been a little over-the-top, caricaturish for my taste. The only thing I liked about Vishwaroop is Kamal Haasan's act, despite his effeminate act to induce laughter. Later in the film, he does make you believe about his reservations to the behavior of the people around him. Unfortunately, the people around him are annoying caricatures that are annoying, especially Omar, the one enacted  by Rahul Bose and oh yes, Nirupama, Vishwanath's wife played by Pooja Kumar. It didn't even look like it would be any better if here dubbing was better than that you see in English movies on TV. Only Jaideep Ahlawat seemed to be taking his role seriously. It doesn't help that the film is forced into becoming a comedy because of some lame behavior by the members of the Taliban. The action except for the first sequence - which is pretty cool, especially because of the repetition - is pretty ordinary. The rest of the action tries to horrify based on gore, which doesn't work at all. There was some potential of an engaging story when it delves into the lifestyle of the Jihadis' families. But soon you feel cheated because it is done only with the purpose getting you emotionally involved temporarily. Whatever interest is created fizzles out as the second half turns into the regular terrorism-based action flick. Let alone novel, it is pretty shoddily handled. Almost everything about Vishwaroop seems superficial. The dots aren't connected well. And yes,  you have been promised a Vishwaroop II.And yet, I shall rephrase a Voltaire quote that is often repeated these days I might not like what you have to say and how you say it, but I shall support your right to say it.

Oh yes, you guessed it right. Freedom fighters holding firelights in their hands and belting some heavily-worded, inspiring songs. I always wonder why the British captured freedom fighters while they were in hiding and never while they were singing openly. But that is how things are portrayed in our films. Being a patriotic tale, I was expecting all this mindless drama in Vitti Dandu. The film didn’t surprise me, barring its basic storyline.Revolved around vitti dandu – a rural game, the film is a fictional incident that took place just six days before the nation got independence. But at its core lies a heartwarming relationship between a grandfather (Dilip Prabhavalkar) and his grandson, who is now narrating that story to his own grandson. As he takes a stroll down memory lane, the tone of his voiceover changes abruptly. His narrative shows you other characters recounting their own memories; as if being a firsthand witness to every happening. This whole affair makes you wonder if the character is genuinely reciting the tale or director Ganesh Kadam is forcibly showing it.Vitti Dandu is an absolutely refreshing story on paper. But it turns out to be an exaggerated one on screen. A conventionally-written screenplay and over-the-top direction fail to match the sincerity of the story. Kadam rather tries to depict it in the same fashion as many other films of its genre, eventually affecting performances of some brilliant actors. Except a few sequences, Prabhavalkar performs at his usual best. Rest of the cast is passable. They seem to be driven by their characters, but end up doing unnatural theatrics.The film’s cinematography sorely misses the point. A simple treatment could’ve helped set the tone of 1947. Production design, too, fails to distinctively create that era. Editing doesn’t help the film either, making an already lackluster narrative even more vulnerable. Contemporary sounds effects and lip-syncing songs are totally out-of-place. Instead of intensifying your experience, they just add to the boredom.Indian films are no match to Hollywood in visual effects (doesn’t mean we’re superior in other departments). They are, in fact, wonderful examples of disastrous VFX. This is despite the fact that major Hollywood productions are outsourced to Indian VFX studios. Considering its budget; I don’t want to delve into Vitti Dandu’s visual effects quality, but the choice of it. The director’s preference to obviously fake appearances for the jeep-driving sequence is definitely startling.The climax sequence is one of my favorite terrible moments in the film. It somehow reminds me of those mindless, south Indian action potboilers. I literally couldn’t stop myself from laughing. This is something unique that makes Vitti Dandu outshine other Indian patriotic films. An achievement in itself, isn’t it?

Fans of Sooraj Barjatya - if that species is not extinct yet - might enjoy a few moments of his typical style. The rest of us didn't care in the first place.The lead pair whispers as if the listener has the most delicate eardrums and the heroine heaves, with her head at a 45 degree angle, as if she is soon going to need asthma medication. It is acceptable if they did that for the first few times - throughout the movie though? All actors, in lead and supporting roles, try to make the best of what lines are given to them. The only actor that stands out is Seema Biswas, she suits the different character she is given. You have the predictable dialogues that spoon-feed the audience with details of  the most obvious, and leave out technical details lest they distract you from the story (if it can be called that). The predictable plot has the ‘world’s best’ human beings (especially the over-virtuous, obedient hero and the nauseatingly shy heroine) – except one. Then there is the predictable screenplay, where the only place a couple can meet is temples and the only clandestine rendezvous is on a rooftop. And surely, there is the predictable exhibition of expensive saris, salwar suits, and jewelry. Kudos to consistency!!! But, hey, the music is unpredictable – it is outright BAD! The good thing about earlier Sooraj Barjatya movies was at least they had songs you could appreciate when you saw them and were at least hummable. Songs of Vivah just make you wish the screeching stopped. Wake up, Mr. Barjatya, it is no more the 80’s. We are getting used to much better cinema and you have much better equipment to provide us with it. So, do not take us for granted and serve us sub-standard products!

It’s the background music – the piano interspersed with a part cheerful, part morose violin set. This immediately changes to a peppy pop song when the couple is all romantic and in love. If you learn to ignore this, and romance films are your thing – then The Vow will give you exactly that. However steer clear of the film if you’re looking for a rom-com; The Vow isn’t funny and you’d be better off watching 50 first dates instead. ","Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams look pretty darn good together. He’s handsome and manly, she’s petite and cute. You’ve won your battle by casting right in a romantic film – where the aim is for the audience to feel the love. It makes the job easier when the lead actors make a good looking pair. The Vow then is a love story between two fairly young individuals who find themselves in a bit of a spot. Everything seems romantically blissful for the newlyweds, Leo and Paige. They seem merrily in love, and their little parade of glee gets cut short when Paige loses her memory in a car accident. She doesn’t remember anything that happened in the last 5 years.On her part, McAdams does the whole confused bit pretty convincingly. Tatum is madly in love with his wife and through regular flashbacks we see the wonderfully romantic things he does for her – and you want to yank her out of her memory loss. But here’s the movie’s biggest problem: nothing is strong enough. The love becomes corny every now and then, no emotion (be it the horror of a memory loss, the frustration of a husband sharing an apartment with his stranger wife and so on) is established strong enough. Halfway through any portrayal, you already want to move onto to the main question the film poses: will she regain her memory?The Vow is based on a real-life incident involving Kim and Krickitt Carpenter, but it doesn’t really grip enough. The first few minutes of the film looks wonderfully bohemian, when we see Leo and Paige’s life. Her art studio with abstract clay cut outs, their apartment filled with color coordinated furniture in different shapes. But really, if that’s the one thing I remember warming my heart, the real hero of this film is production designer Kalina Ivanov.Unlike similarly plotted film, 50 First Dates, this film doesn’t have a comedy streak to fall back on. Or a goofy Adam Sandler. It could have been a fairly gripping film, with an interesting plot, if it steered clear of the regular cliché: love conquers all. Treated differently, perhaps the film could have focused on how Leo strives to make her fall back in love with him. On the contrary, The Vow leaves much to chance for the lead pair to realize their feelings for one another. Sure, it’s a well-behaved clean average film. If you’re in the mood for a cheesy weekend flick, The Vow delivers promptly. It could have been a crisp film; free from melodrama had the dialogues been given more attention, but with a good looking lead pair and a regular dose of love, this is your run-off-the-mill romance movie. If you’re into it, it gives you exactly what you want.

A sweet DVD/TV watch when its out.,"As morbid as it sounds, I have instructions on what's to be done if I meet with an accident if I were to go into a coma. Exactly, for the reasons that Waiting ponders over – there is no right or wrong when you are at a point to choose between keeping hope alive and letting go. Waiting takes on both sides without making it heavy-handed or too emotional either. That does create a distance between the audience and the characters but it works for the film. Anything else would have run into the danger of going into cliché territory. For example, you don't know much about Tara (Kalki Koechlin) or Shiv's (Naseeruddin Shah) relationships with their spouses. You are given glimpses here and there but not enough to make you feel like you knew it. It is more like a given. This causes the distance but if they were to pick the standard montage of  sweet 'moments', it would take Waiting into 'typical' category. Else, they would have to spend a lot of time in exposition. I will take a little disconnect till they figure out a newer way of telling us how good it was for the two couples. They are all regular people who have expected reactions to unexpected situations. No one gets extra character development or such. Interestingly though, a good and important introduction time is used for Tara's feminist side. We don't see that put to use anywhere? Why was it there then? To show us she speaks her mind? Well, we got that and Shiv elaborates on it too.  Unfortunately, it comes across as a gimmick to shock. Beyond that, in it's own sweet-yet-dull sort of a way, Waiting is not out there to create any great impact. There is no 
“coming-of-age”, there is no big reveal, no attempt at drama. That is why it stands out. A film about death and no drama! In its larger scheme the film might be about death and dilemmas around it. But, it is also a subtler comment on other life philosophies – every person has to fight their own fight; loners who hate people need company too; fate isn't fair. A dash about our distrust of the medical system is thrown in too. And then you have the more spelled out ones which I wish had taken a subtler route - like the stages of grief which read out like its Wikipedia page. No, Naseeruddin Shah as reader doesn't help. Both lead actors are wonderful though, their chemistry feels very real. They are one of the main reasons, the film took me out of 'review' mode and made me forget I was watching a film. That and the soft tone, the smooth texture of the film. Unfortunately, some of the other elements reminded me back into the film world. like Tara's husband's colleague, Girish seemed like a caricature or Tara and Shiv's decisions  didn't seem to flow with the pace of the film. These are little things that take away from Waiting. They make a film that I loved watching while I was watching it not keeping with me for too long after.

But even the opposites had something similar that keep them together, for each other, and maybe even for ever. Similarities or differences - celebrate whatever it is that is the cause of your love. A chick flick that's not only for chicks. ","The whiff of the Arabian Sea. You smell it. The first few drops of rain on your sweating forehead. You sense them. The love that only a Mumbaikar can express for his city. You feel it. I'm getting all romantic on you. You dread it. But what do I do when I see two people just be so comfortable on screen - as characters and as actors. Not necessarily romantically in the ""more than friends"" sort-of a way. But romantically as two individuals who react and interact. So, you got that? The number of times ""romantic"" and its derivatives have been repeated so far should indicate that you, the young lads, should already be planning that dinner date after the perfect date movie. And chicks, go watch this flick. The older generation on the other hand could empathize with the parents in the film. Sid is a normal, college-going kid - neither the superstar of his college, nor the super-buffoon. Neither the teenage heartthrob nor the class dunce. He's carefree and proud of it. Aisha is serious and knows what she wants. Her practicality is not an exaggeration, nor is it understated - a regular, motivated girl. Their contrasts - evident. Their similarities - to be deciphered. The first sequence in the film tells you this film is going take its own time to develop and unfold. And by the last sequence you know there isn't much unfolding to be done (except t-shirts and kurtis). The story is half-a-line and yet I'm going to be feel hurt on behalf of the makers if the audience complained, ""there was no story!"" At times when the movie goes deeper, it doesn't need too many words to describe the story. And the more time I spent with Sid (Ranbir Kapoor) and Aisha (Konkona Sen Sharma), the more I wanted to know them. It felt better to see screen time being spent on the niceties of their relationship. It was good to see them grow closer to and fonder of each other. Aaawww…that's what friendships should be like. And then I was deprived of more. And I was hurt when one was oblivious to the other's emotions just to satisfy the hunger for drama. Whether it’s the maker's hunger or the audience's - I do not know. But annoyed I was, to see the twosome that got me into their drawing room, throw me out by their out-of-character, ignorant behavior. Those two, who were candid, lucid and were supposed to be best of friends until a few minutes ago. Then there were the couple of side characters who were there just to throw in a punch. Anything to do with Karan Johar has to have some angle of parental love and associated dramatic moments. Whether or not they belong. And they do not belong here. Especially when you realize one of them has been caricatured just for that one punch line. The lines which were fine until then and later too. Smartly used by thinking and sensitive characters. And suddenly it's spoilt by one on-the-face line. While these individual characters didn't work, most of the interconnected relationships were well-developed with just a scene or two. But whatever bit the dialogue-writer lacked, was made up in the way the two protagonists were created. Of course, kudos to the two actors, one maturing, and one who looks like she was born with fully-developed acting skills. The maturing Ranbir Kapoor will, I guess, be the industry's first candidate for the puppy-look, innocent boy. And yet not boy-next door. I enjoyed bits of their performances more because of how up-close I saw their expressions. Similarly there is this whole list of things that add value due to their absence. And top on my list is the conscious decision of not having that pause, that moment of awkwardness between a boy and a girl because of that hug, that touch. Its handled delicately and with finesse. We were just getting used to a superficial attitude of making a film about the woman protagonist, but end up seeing the man claim glory. This one is equally Ranbir's and Konkona's. Yes, even though the title of the film contains the protagonist's name.For a long-long time I've been watching out for a Hindi romantic film where the story is about the lead pair. That's it. Their emotions, their turmoil and nothing else.  Love Aaj Kal was close and Wake Up Sid comes even closer. I guess some background noise is inevitable to satisfy our need-more-masala palettes. But, we are growing up as an audience and it's so heartening to see our masala-chef production houses walk hand-in-hand with us.

Written for the screen and directed by Scott Frank, the film also has the added benefit of having Liam Neeson play a character you don’t expect so much from him. ","Though far from perfect, writer-director Scott Frank’s A Walk Among the Tombstones, adapted from a Lawrence Block novel of the same name, comes across as a refreshing change. Perhaps it was the sight of Liam Neeson in the publicity material that caused one to fear that the film would once again have Neeson play what he’s been doing so frequently in the recent past. Thankfully enough, his character as well as the film itself are treated with rare patience.Set in the year 1999 (the period building up to the greatest of anti-climaxes, that Y2K non-event), Neeson plays Matt Scudder, a recovering alcoholic and retired (for a reason) NYPD cop who now takes up cases as a private investigator, even if he is an unlicensed one. A Walk Among the Tombstones has an intriguing air about it, all the way through. Aided greatly by Mihai Malaimare Jr. 's  cinematography, but propelled mostly by Scott Frank’s mature, stoic handling of the film, it is the atmosphere of the film that is its biggest strength. Reminiscent often of Denis Villeneuve’s Prisoners (though not nearly as haunting), the film unfolds at its own gentle pace. Apart from the mature treatment, the film also gives us a more real hero than we’ve come to expect from any Hollywood film lately, let alone one that has Liam Neeson in the lead. It is great to see him not effortlessly mowing down multiple baddies at one go, actually get beaten up a little bit himself, but still show the spirit to carry on. In one of the best scenes of the film, a man draws a knife on Scudder; the way the scene eventually plays out will surprise you, and it will underline why sometimes it makes so much sense to infuse realism into cinema.The film also gives us a pair of unlikely bad guys. David Harbour, who plays one of them, is terrific in particular. There is something chilling about the remorseless way in which they do what they do, though their background and motivations aren’t sufficiently explained. My other grouse with the film was the fact that the slow pace and spine-tingling ambiance all seemed to be building up to something that would grab at your gut, but that doesn’t quite happen. The film still will have your stomach in a knot for the most, but amping up the shock value somewhere would perhaps have served the film well.Then again, you realize that that never seemed to be the director’s intention in the first place. There’s a message or two in the film (through the character of Scudder himself, as well as his interactions with a homeless boy named T.J.); there’s a vacant, sepulchral feel that draws you in; and there’s a nice turn by a terrific actor playing a character truly worth rooting for. That was what Scott Frank always seemed to hold as his trump cards, and they’re what deliver a decent film - one that demands patience, yes, but which ultimately rewards you with that feeling of having inhabited a world outside of your own.

And this was not restricted to the first few minutes of the film, it continued at regular intervals through to the end. So, the Salman-followers can stop reading here and head for the theater, it's waiting to echo with your whistles.For the rest of us lesser-mortals, there ain't much going on there. It’s the gang war routine. One kills the other kills the third and so on. And a couple of turns along the way. The story is as random, unbelievable and a crazy as one could expect. Yet, the dialogues can keep you going for a while, there are some really funny lines here and there.Salman Khan has his style accompanied by the one-expression-says-it-all expression. Of course, slo-mo entries add to the spunk, as if there was any lacking. Then there's Ayesha Takia trying to cope with the speed of the film. I don't know what it is with her or maybe her image - she just doesn't fit in the typical masala role. Not to mention her wardrobe reminds me of the weird stuff doing the rounds in the 90s. And despite this, she does look really good over and above her warmth in some scenes. That one I'd give full credit to the extra layers of makeup.Also the lady can't dance. I actually felt bad for her. She was hardly ever dancing WITH Salman in the same frame. The sequence cut to her doing some simple steps every once in a while. Fair enough, not every actor need to know how to do Prabhu Deva steps. But if they can, its sheer pleasure to watch them. I was in awe of Salman and the choreographer while the first song was playing. Pure delight. Then there's the romantic thread. It has a certain quality about it, but since it doesn't go too deep, you couldn't care too much for either forming in the pair or the pair as an entity. And I guess that's not the intention either. Wanted is merry at the surface, then why would it want to go deeper?There must have been a swearing in ceremony for the cast and crew - ""I swear on the XXX, I shall not take myself seriously."" I think a similar clause applies when you buy your ticket. Me? Well, I'm not star-crazy, so I wouldn't understand the mania. But it was fun watching what people enjoy.

For obvious reasons, I am leaning towards the latter interpretation. There are way too many questions that crop up and remain unanswered. Why does Ishwar (Amtiabh Bachchan) behave a certain way for 27 years and then make a 180 degree turnaround in behavior at the most inappropriate juncture in his son's life? Why is Aadi (Akshay Kumar) such a nondescript loser despite being portrayed as smart and educated?  Why are we being asked to feel sorry for this loser? While I am at it, why is Akshay Kumar made out to be a 27 year old?If a movie is about relationships, shouldn't it, at the very least, have consistent characters involved in those relationships?  And this one should have been easier, right? It is about just one relationship, so only two characters need to be well-defined.Why anyone should try and excel at the art of making Amitabh Bachchan overact, is beyond me. I weep silently when I see the 'master of comic timing' run around trying to hit someone in an attempt to make me laugh. Director's actor and all is fine, but didn't he feel one-bit silly while saying the lamest lines ever? What did I do to deserve this? Oh sorry, this isn't about me, is it? Okay, time to snap out of ""questions"" mode.Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav as comic relief serve their purpose. They relieve you from the drudgery of bad-scripting that forms the main plot. But, the same type of joke is repeated once too often and you want relief from the jokes then. The overall plot is not a bad premise for a movie at all. But the way the details in the script have been handled is outright shabby. E.g., it is amazing that no one on the crew has ever seen how a pregnant woman is treated or behaves. No, pregnant women are not patients. They should live an active lifestyle. But, it's silly when you dance and sway around in air at one point and are not allowed to do a single household chore in the next.The redeeming factor is that you feel like slapping Aadi into reality, which means Akshay Kumar has done his job well. Of course, the assumption being that his character is meant to irritate you. And tears jerked every once in a while for a sensitively handled scene here and there. Nonetheless, in a futile attempt to please crowds, a decent story has been slaughtered with soap opera-ish situations, ridiculously placed songs, and jokes played out in skit format. And such imprudence shall not be forgiven.Alrighty then, I am off for a week-long holiday. Yep! Vacationing meetu = no review this Friday. Until next week then, hasta-la-vista...

Instead preaches. ","War films - whether they are between countries or gangs - invariably end up touching on the futility of war.  War - Chhod Na Yaar wears it as a badge of honor. Even though, the route is different because they use satire and comedy, the theme is rubbed in way too hard. True, the solution to something like the India-Pakistan war can be as simple as 'stop fighting'. If only, it were that simple though, right? Given that War Chhod Na Yaar is satire and doesn't claim to take anything seriously, it might be a tad unfair to hold its simple solutions against it. Even so, the film misses basic coherence.Behind its satirical coat, War Chhod Na Yaar can get away with the implausibility of the plot. But then, the characters, situations, and dialogue were supposed to make you laugh or at least smirk, right? For example, the initial setup of an imminent war at the border, where our protagonists are stationed, doesn't move beyond until the film is well into the second half. To keep the situations comic you have typical potshots at Pakistanis. I would like to think that even for those who find it funny, the jokes would get old within five minutes of the film. Other than that there is toilet humor and other inane one-liners. And generic references to facebook and chat do not a cool movie make. Maybe, there is an odd line here or there that could make you laugh; other than that you are just waiting for something to happen. Sharman Joshi, Javed Jaffrey, and Sanjai Mishra do bring some energy to the film. However again, their characters get repetitive and thus predictable pretty soon. Soha Ali Khan is required to feel shy, flirt with her eyes and look determined every once in a while. She does that all right. Then you have your regular dose of songs that have no business being in the film. I guess we should just be thankful that there aren't any choreographed and/or item numbers. I am all for films that speak about the power of the common man. But, War Chhodo Na Yaar is more dissuading than empowering. It is highly unlikely that the makers didn't want to inspire the audience and make them feel like they can play a role. In that case, you can only think of it as an attempt that failed. Not to mention that an entire section of the population has been totally ignored. The section that does believe that the war should be fought. Maybe, that would be another film. Hopefully not.

The film is a bit too stretched, and while the visuals are impressive and colorful, somewhere it fails to hold your emotions to its heart. ","On being released alongside this week’s Bollywood valentine flick, Ek Main aur Ekk Tu, a friend of mine had a rather snide wisecrack to make on Spielberg’s War Horse. “So essentially, War Horse is a romantic film with a horse?” he said. In my head, I decided I would make no such presumptions; that so many rights had to make for a brilliant film (the nominations, Spielberg’s sensibilities on non-human and sensitive war films – ET, Schindler’s List, Saving Private Ryan). Barring John Williams’s avalanche of a background score, and Janusz Kaminski’s beautifully visualized picture of the film, War Horse is in actuality a long-drawn, schematic film about a boy and his relationship with his horse that tries to compel you to fall in love with it. Based on the novel of the same name by British author Michael Morpugo, the film is also set at the backdrop of the World War. Albert (notable debut by Jeremy Irvine) gets attached to his purebred Joey. As the war seeps through the English countryside, his family has to sell Joey. The narrative then moves to Joey’s point of view, somewhere around 1918. He meets Emile, a French farm girl who lives with her grandfather and is a horse-owner too. The difference between the two owners is depicted beautifully from Joey’s point of view – as Albert is passionate and rustic, Emile is gentle and subtle. Celiene Buckens as Emile is a delight, often bringing in lighter moments, as she compares the two horses to two boyfriends she never had. But before we can rest with the changing narrative we are taken back to Albert’s journey – who has set out on a mission to find Joey.War Horse at many points becomes too epic, forcing you to feel the same sense of splendor that one must have felt with films like Schindler’s List. This film however, is nowhere close – the story is rather old-world and laborious, and so is the production design, sets and several moments of the performances by the lead actors. To be fair, you have to give it to Spielberg for allowing the audiences to sensitize with the non-human protagonists in his film (see ET, and now War Horse). The cinematography by Spielberg’s right arm, Janusz Kaminski is meticulous and the clear winner of the film. He manages to bring out the right play of light and colours to make the film a very pretty picture. You do feel for Joey, you move alongside him in the film, but by sheer pacing, War Horse fails to grip you. You don’t feel that lump in your throat that most World War films bring with it. The war sequences are swift and grand, reminding you of films like Kubrick’s Paths of Glory and the hues and treatment also remind you of the civil war from Gone with the Wind. The visuals are magnanimous, but somewhere in his journey to get a “wow” out of the audience for War Horse, Spielberg has lost out on the most intrinsic part of the film – connection. War Horse remains a luxuriously larger-than-life film with a potentially heart-tugging premise, which looks pastoral and splendid but becomes too long and doesn’t stay with you.

But, you expect a few more thrills from a thriller with sharks and expanses of open water.","A theme that involves a bunch of people stuck in a tight life or death situation can invoke only so much thrill. Especially, if you are exposed to thrillers.  You know some will die, some will make it. You know bad things will happen and either the characters will find a way out or not. The mystery of whether or not happens by itself isn't intriguing enough. Then what is it that hooks the audience in, if at all? Characters? Atmosphere? You need that extra spark to keep you with the film, which unfortunately is wanting in Warning. What Warning has though is an urge to do something that has rarely, if ever, been tried in Hindi films - use vast expanses of water to create a chilling atmosphere. It succeeds at times, and not so much at others but the effort to do something new is not lost on the audience. A large part of what didn't work can be attributed to the loss of brightness due to 3D. I won't say the 3D was bad, because it does shake you up a bit when a shark comes your way, if only the water was bluer maybe the film wouldn't come across as dull.True, once the situation sets in, there is hardly any up or down in the arc of the story. You have your regular drill of the blame-game, self-blame, introspection people bonding and/or fighting and so on.  There are huge group dynamics that can be explored in situations like this. But, neither the thrill element nor the human angle is touched upon more than superficially. It helps then that the actors do a decent job put together. Except for the French speaking woman who looks out-of-place, maybe intentionally, the rest of the cast goes about alternating between supportive, scared, strong, sad and so on pretty well. Another thing that worked well was the claustrophobia created by the open space that the ocean is. By the end of the film, you could feel your skin shrivel as if you were in the water for those over 1.5 hours. I don't know if I should happy then that an attempt was made or be unhappy that it wasn't taken a level deeper to engage and/or explore.

A film about the physical and emotional battles of two brothers, the poster and trailer look intense and heavy. Admittedly, there were moments in the film which didn’t fit. But the overall effect of Warrior leaves you with a contemplative after-taste. ","When a movie, with a genre you don’t particularly care about, gets you passionately involved in a discussion about the outcome and characters – you know it’s a movie worth its money. Warrior does that to you, engaging you in a fighter film about two estranged brothers, ex-Army officer Tommy (Tom Hardy) and School teacher Brendon (Joel Edgerton). Both enter an MMA (mixed martial arts) tournament with a 5 million cash prize for different reasons. It’s a battle within a war – and it transcends to an emotional flight of two brothers. Tommy’s battling with his own demons, and the tournament for him becomes an escape. Brendon, on the other hand needs the money to prevent his home from being held by the bank.  The family’s a broken one – ex-Alcoholic father (Nick Nolte) who lives alone and two brothers who have gone their separate ways. Through the film, you can sense the complexity of each relationship. The brothers broke apart when the parents got divorced – and imaginary boundaries were formed. The father's drinking past has led him to isolation from the sons. Yet Tommy returns to be trained by his father for the tournament – and somewhere then, you know there is scope (and are hoping) for reconciliation.Does it incorporate clichés? Yes, you can expect drama and a few tears, alongside some heavy-duty MMA action. It’s the kind of sport I routinely stay away from when on TV – mostly because I never understood how someone could make a sport out of beating each other up so brutally. However with Warrior you learn to move past the fundamentals. You feel the blood and bones of the fights and you know the outcome, but that’s acceptable because it takes you with it on the journey. The treatment is a tad bit clichéd – because you know who’s going to win the fights, you know how, and while the tension is being built up between the father and the brothers, you know where you’re headed. The film works mainly because of the superb performances; clear winner remains Nick Nolte. A vulnerable yet tough ex-alcoholic and fighter, he deals with the strange turn of events in a realistically painful way. Tom Hardy is in his element, as an aggressive, emotionally burdened character – results of which show in his fighting. Joel Edgerton is heart-warming; you can feel his pain.By the climax of the film, you start to feel that the weight of the script lapses, but director Gavin O’Connor manages to divert your attention to the intense fights. The overpowering feeling of redemption hovers around the movie, and before you know, you get powerfully involved with Warrior. I’m quoting a friend here, who shared my exact sentiments of the film, “I think there’s still some scope for Hollywood”.

It sounds too good to be true, right? Well you got that right. It is a movie that sways between being a gory-action flick to a lough-out-loud comedy, and ends up being none. Even if you’re super-keen, save your money and wait for DVD. But the chances are, you’d like it even less on DVD as the only good thing about the movie is its cinematography.","The USP of The Warriors Way is gory action between Ninjas and Cowboys. With Cowboys and Aliens just around the corner, I thought all my prayers are about to be answered. For years, fans have been fantasizing about mixing two or more cults. Firefly and Cowboy Bebop are excellent examples of Space Cowboys and Blood - The Last vampire had Samurai vs Vampires. There are plenty more examples to cite - some lesser known than others. Now that Hollywood is experimenting by mixing things up, I was super-excited about The Warriors Way. I am extremely disappointed.The movie has all the tools to become a cult-blockbuster. It has an excellent cast in Dong-gun Jang (Korean superstar) as the rogue Ninja (also, the best swordsman in the history of mankind) and Geoffrey Rush as a reformed bandit (also, an ace-shooter of a cowboy). The film is produced by Barrie M. Osborne of The Lord Of The Rings franchise. Not much could have gone wrong. Correction: Not much ‘should’ have gone wrong. But a lot did. And the fault lies with the script by Sngmoo Lee and the screenplay. I can’t pick which is worse. The flashbacks come out of nowhere. The climate changes with every swing of the sword. It feels like they were really trying hard to make it a senseless flick.The first five minutes of the movie took away all the built-up excitement as they attempt to be humorous amidst gory action sequences. So you begin to think, okay its going to be one of those “From Dusk Till Dawn” (classic Cowboys vs Vampires) kind of movies. But then the movie becomes serious, and only manages to be unintentionally funny. Some of the action sequences are really well done though. I loved the last twenty minutes or so of the movie. I also loved the fact that the movements of Ninjas is quite close to those in animes (like Naruto). But visual perfection only makes up so much for everything else that’s just mediocre. You are still sitting through the shoddiest screenplay ever, and some pathetic acting by the supporting cast. Who doesn’t want to see Ninjas and Cowboys fight it out? So, I know you’re keen. But save your money, and wait for a DVD/TV release. Bonus: You can fast forward to the good parts and skip all the sad-drama in the middle.

617,1317,1317,1317,1317,Watchmen,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma reviewNotepad,/movie/watchmen-review/,,,,2.933333333,The long awaited adaptation of the famous graphic novel is a trifle disappointing.,"The Watchmen has for long remained one of the most inaccessible of the graphic novels, inaccessible when it came to transposing it to the big screen.  The novel is dense, multi textured, and works on at least three levels.   It has a plot which is highly nuanced and extremely well detailed, its characters are a far cry from the standard “super hero” genre, and its themes remain extremely contemporary and disturbing.  The audience for this movie would clearly be divided into two, those who have read the novel and would want it to be replicated down to its tiniest detail, and those who have not and who would see the film as “normal” viewers.  The former would be the legions and hordes of fans that have analysed and discussed the novel and its symbolisms, allusions, and connotations ad nauseam, while the latter would by and large have no clue about what they are to encounter.  I belong to the first group and therefore it is really difficult for me to write about the film as a “normal” viewer.  Comparisons with the novel are unavoidable, but I have tried to restrict it to a minimum.  Let me then start with the screen play.  The novel has enough material to make a mini series, but to fit into a big screen format it has been reduced to a running time of just less than three hours.  The screenplay has been pared down to the essentials that help keep the plot moving and simultaneously introduce us to the “Watchmen”, a group of “superheroes”, by way of multiple back stories and flashbacks.  A lot of detail and intricacies have been sacrificed for cinematic convenience.  The director tries to make up for this by packing a lot of cues into every frame; cues that help the viewer understand that the universe of the Watchmen is not “real”, but an imagined alternate one.  So there are news paper headlines, images on television that reference to real life incidents of the 70’s and 80’s, TV interviews, and the presence of at least five historical characters including Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger.  The title sequence is ingenious, a series of sequential images in “slow still motion”, that depict the passing of time and concomitant changes.  The entire title sequence is set to Bob Dylan’s 'The times they are a Changing', and it comes off very well.  In fact certain iconic songs are used very well in the film, Simon and Garfunkel’s 'Sounds of Silence' beautifully underscores the mood of another sequence.  What I really loved was the wailing, wrenching, Jimi Hendrix version of Bob Dylan’s apocalyptic 'All along the Watchtower', which sets the mood for the surreal climax.  The acting is top notch, the actors are “unknowns”, all barring Billy Crudup who plays Dr Manhattan, all naked, godlike, and blue to boot.  Crudup’s acting is superb, his character seems detached from human concerns, but through his soft voice and facial movements, he creates a persona that comes across as vulnerable, powerful, but yet deeply human.  Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre 2 is sometimes jarring, but she does well enough, as her role really does not demand too much.  But the prize goes to Jackie Earl Haley who plays Rorschach.  He dons a mask through out the film, we get to see his face only in the end and that too briefly, but through his hoarse rasping voice and the set of his shoulders, he conveys his uncompromising morality.  He is aided by the fact that some of the most powerful dialogues (mostly as a voice over) belong to him.   Director Zach Snyder is good with CGI, going by his previous film 300.  Here he does not overdo the special effects; the visual impact of Dr Manhattan’s character is very well done.  The film makes an effort to replicate the panels of the graphic novel as far as possible and the visual composition is very well designed. For a “superhero” movie, there are hardly any action scenes, just two to be precise, involving fisticuffs.  They seem rather redundant and are downplayed; the movie could easily have done without them. The climax is rather disappointing and this is the movie’s fatal flaw.  The climax just does not have enough punch, and it comes across as rather tame and inconsequential.   This could possibly be due to two reasons; in the novel it is the atmosphere and the ambience created that matter more than the outcome, or it could be due to the fact that the elaborate plot deals with larger metaphysical concerns which do not translate too well cinematically, or well, both.  For those who have not read the novel, the film might be difficult to grasp (this is what some of my “normal viewer” friends have told me).  But for those who have the courage, it might well be worth the effort to watch this film.  The film is good, but definitely not great.  One does get a feel of the “Watchmen” universe all right, hopefully a viewing might prompt some film goers to lay their hands on what for my money, is the best graphic novel till date.

The interdependecies between the characters are not sketched out in detail. And overall, the movie does not make an impact.","The mere sound of the phrase “plight of widows”, grips your heart. Is it then, that difficult to make a movie on this issue, which stirs you from the inside? Looks like it is. Water,  leaves you feeling cheated because you are still waiting for a punch, a hard hit on your sensibilities, even after the movie is done. The movie starts with a bang. The opening sequence makes your heart go out for little Chuyia (Sarala), the 7-8 year old widow. But, the narrative begins to fizzle out after the first ten minutes and never regains the impact. And the climax seemed very illogical. The only other touching moment comes when the lead pair has its first romantic rendezvous. Though not magical, it is very sweet.  However, you have to give it points for not being preachy or whiny. It just tells a story, and lets the audience answer the unasked question, ""Is this the way it should be?"" This movie is worth watching for its performances. Widows of different age groups having varied temperaments, have been portrayed really well. You can almost see how the younger one can be the one in the next age group when she grows older. Sarala makes you feel for her innocent but rebellious attitude. Lisa Ray, the teen widow, wants to be saved from her loveless life in the widow asylum.  Seema Biswas, plays to perfection, the role of a widow in her late 30s who has resigned to her fate, but still understands the desires of the younger widows. You can see the strength she gives them despite her internal struggle to stick to her faith, in both her expressions and her body language. Manorama, plays the classic pain-in-the-wrong-place-opportunist. Her double standards dare you to defy her. You know she has done her job well, when you feel like giving her one tight slap right across the face! Vidula Javalgekar plays a minor role of a widow (called aunty by the other widows) who is approaching the end of her life. Her mannerisms and love for food reminds you of Chunibala devi who played a very similar role in Pather Panchali. The problem is that though the individual characterization and performances don’t disappoint, most of the relationships between the individuals is underdeveloped…certainly wanting of more chemistry. Be it the relationship between Narayan (John Abraham) and Kalyani (Lisa) or Madhumati (Manorama) and Chuyia (Sarala), it was difficult to understand the motivations. E.g., Why did Narayan like Kalyani? The movie did not show any reason for Chuyia to obey Madhumati. The beginning makes you squirm and feel “oh boy! I am really going to be depressed at the end of this movie”. But, fortunately or unfortunately, that does not happen.

Good performances, though.","The “edge-of-the-seat” bit of a thriller comes from you second guessing yourself on what you think might happen. If however, you know for sure what the turnout is going to be like the edge is taken off. Yet, a hopeless hopeful like me,  waits for the unwrapping – the manner in which it will all play out. Wazir disappoints with that too.Even if you didn't figure it out, Wazir's twists are unraveled through monologues that spell out the scheme – be it by the victim or the perpetrator. That kind of resolution is one of the worst kinds in a thriller. Just because the other characters in the film are awestruck, it takes a little more to surprise the audience. Wazir can get points for making it quick though. There isn't a long-winded explanation, just short, sweet and shut. In that sense, the film is crisp and moves along pretty swiftly. It keeps you interested even though it might have meant to keep you glued. During the film for some reason, I was expecting it to break into a “khoya khoya chand”, a la Shaitan. Though I remember that one not fitting in the film and coming across as a gimmick in the context of the film. In that sense, Wazir lacks style. I know, I know, what is the poor director to do! Style comes across as gimmick when done and when missing, the viewer missed it. However, I am positive I wouldn't have missed it one bit had it been for a strong story. The chess analogies seem lame. The breadcrumbs for the “twists” are too obvious. For instance, you know a certain dialogue is being overshadowed by another one  because the former has a clue. And indeed, when the mystery unveils, the dialogue is repeated, just in case the audience needs to be spoonfed. And this is despite an inscrutable performance by Amitabh Bachchan. Of course, I mean that in a good way. A quip-less Farhan Akhtar is a little hard to take in. While it is a good change for him as an actor, as the audience you are expecting him to break into a smart-Alec line any time. Sure, that cannot be held against him, it's just that the character makes him that guy with just one expression. Aditi Rao Hydari looks gorgeous and yet again, is just that. Interestingly, though each of her roles use her as just the necessary female lead, I have wondered what she would do with a really meaty role. That leaves us with a thriller in which can tell two of the main twists from a mile away and are willing to forgive the writing because of the performances. Until the revelations come in the worst form possible. Even so, for those of us who couldn't guess the twist, Wazir might be well worth the watch.

Our big daddy is Mr. Patronizing Dialogue and soccer mom is the Great Indian Kangan. Oh yeah and our stepmom is Stepmom. ","We Are Family...hmmm the name still gave me the creeps as I entered the theater. Shrugging it off, I settled myself in for a cushy, melodramatic, soap opera - the English version of which I've seen. I wondered as I walked out, ""Does one well-made teary scene, warrant a 'good' opinion?"" I didn't have the heart to write-off a film for its thousand flaws when it managed to have one scene that touched me because it was written, performed and directed well. Even if most of the emotion is because of the way I identified with the situation, ""Oh my God! What if I'm dying and I have to tell my kids about it?"" boo-hoo-hoooo-tissue-please Ok, now that we are done with the 'credit where it's due bit', I feel liberated and let the 'ripping apart' begin!We'll start soft, just like the film. It is a mature concept and the big picture is actually non-standard considering the typical Hindi family stories. When you start watching Stepmom you feel like you have started reading a book from the middle of a chapter. We Are Family sort-of covers that gap and gives a more rounded beginning. Also, the missing backstory of the three main leads, from Stepmom, is provided briefly. And the short one or two line descriptions work perfectly. And the stage is set for a fine melodrama...or not. The performances aren't what I feared - shrieks and shrills or over-the-top. But they fail to move or get you interested, let alone involved. Mom-type Kajol; strong yet unsure, Kareena Kapoor and hunk dad Arjun Rampal show you their dilemma and the struggle, but none of them make you don't feel for them. Maybe because the characters have flaws and they are not necessarily good human beings. But they are not bad enough to hate. Awesome gray characters I've always been waiting for, but they still seem out of a book, not real human beings. And it is difficult to point out what exactly didn't work in the writing and execution of these three characters. The kids on the other hand are pretty much caricatures that are plucked from one filmy stereotype to another. Actually, I got that wrong. Not all three of them are designed that way. The little boy, has absolutely nothing to do. His middle name might as well have been, 'Haven't a clue why I exist.' The writer's cluelessness transcends  barriers of the fourth wall to haunt the audience.I don't think there was any attempt at all to make the film's events unpredictable. The trailer itself gives away the main elements of the film by way of dialogue, sequences, songs or make-up. Moreover, why would one watch We Are Family instead of Stepmom? There is hardly any value addition or Indianization. Unless you count making it with 3 kids instead of 2 and having a ""kangan"" (bangle) scene. Oops! How could I forget how they allude to the idea that woman's ultimate aim in life is to get married. And then directly go on to say that being a mother comes with the XX chromosome! Without getting into an argument about the modern woman versus the traditional idea of a woman's role in society, I'd like to say that these concepts are rather regressive. Not to mention that two women who were/are in love with the same guy are shown dancing together. I mean, I'm sure there are many women who'd get along that way, but here it wasn't convincing enough. The concept of We Are Familyconstantly reminded me of what I remember as a beautiful film, Mere Baad where Rakhee Gulzar plays a mom of four kids. It's a soul-touching film about how she goes about looking for foster parents for her kids after she's diagnosed with a fatal disease. No, We Are Family is nowhere close to being that sensitive, but I suddenly feel like digging that one out. Any pointers for where to start?

The administration, in turn, turning all its resources up-side-down. We've seen this and a lot more in Hollywood. But, when you take this basic plot, add some very basic action to it, cast the most wonderful cast you could have, you have me arrested - not wanting to blink once.I like to observe how the titles of a movie are done, because in a way, it’s a measure of how much respect the decision makers have for their crew. Many a time there's so much noise and glitter during the titles that you are forced to not read the opening credits. So, when half of A Wednesday's titles are plain white text on black background with zero sound, I am hooked. There's one scene where the person threatening to set-off bombs is very close to being caught. At that point, I was wondering how cool it'd be if he's actually caught at this point, wonder how the story will move on. And at the very same time, I was sincerely hoping that he escapes. Just in case, his capture would mean that the movie is close to its end. I hadn't even realized that it's not even interval yet, that's how much I was enjoying the thrill and the build-up.While introducing its characters to us, A Wednesday also takes digs at the influence of ""stars"" in our film industry, gender bias in our society, ""creation"" of news by our media, and the general attitude of our law and order officials. Along the way, it comments on the impotency of our law enforcement department (though, it was refreshing to see a room full of committed police officers). And as a final bang, very smartly, the plot uses the same impotency to make right right. Just less than 24 hours ago, I was applauding a director's effort to give Anupam Kher a non-loud, meaningful role. And here we have a movie which has him as the protagonist. Sure, it doesn't require him to go through the whole range of expressions an actor - particularly this one - is capable of. But what it gives him back is our - his audience's - respect. What can I say about Naseeruddin Shah - I was just left speechless by his character's confidence and angst, whether ill-placed or not. Even though, thrillers are not necessarily the best genre to display acting prowess. Anupam Kher and Jimmy Shergill are what I call the soft faces in the film fraternity. However, stern their characters, you expect them to soften up sooner or later. But they have such strong attitudes here, that when you see Anupam Kher and even Jimmy beat someone up, you don't question it. Both the writing and the performances complement each other. The smaller side characters also have their charm. Like, the young self-made hacker was cute. Yep! I actually found a geek adorable. Speaking of which, except for the amusing graphics on the screen, the other technical talk didn’t sound like mumbo-jumbo.The melodramatic background score used to create suspense and the overdramatic slo-mo stylization of Naseeruddin Shah's character are about the only things that irritated me. From the tone of the movie otherwise, especially the muted titles, I got the feel that this excessive drama was not based on creative decisions from the heart but the director resorted to them because he was supposed to. Surprisingly though, the speech in the climax didn't get tiringly preachy. That's mostly because the motivations sounded novel yet believable.Anupam Kher and Naseerudin Shah - truly a pleasure to see you on the screen together, sirs! That too in a thriller...

Each scene outdoes the previous one in defying your belief in any kind of sense. No amount of good acting can help save the careless writing.,"Why are we supposed to be entertained by suspending our sense of reason? Why is a few laughs considered ""worth it""? Why is ""time-pass"" good enough? Why is one forced sequence after another called a script? Why is comedy dictating the situation, instead of comedy flowing from the situation?Save a couple of one-liners here and there, there's nothing enjoyable about this slapstick. Unless you are the kind who enjoys patting yourself on being able to accurately predict what the writers have in store. The male cast does not surprise, in that they do exactly what they have been doing in every slapstick. So, while they do their bit well, not many viewers would object to them choosing worthier scripts.  Except for Feroz Khan. It almost felt like the makers didn’t think anyone in the cast was worthy of first billing. So they got Feroz Khan to blow his trumpet to justify and take the lead in the opening credits. Katrina Kaif fulfills expectations. She satisfactorily basks in the glory of the light thrown on her and giggles to fill in for lack of lines. Mallika Sherawat on the other hand, seriously does well as the designated flirt of the movie.Technically the movie is plain awful. To start off, it makes liberal, blatant, and shabby use of the blue screen. It might have been just about acceptable if it were just the first two. But in combination with the third the visuals are just disastrous. The camera work, especially in the beginning, looked like the cameraman was testing out the properties of a wide angle lens. The non-existent editing just adds to the woes. Continuity gets step-sisterly treatment a little too often. No effort seems to have been taken even to match the colors between shots in a few sequences.Some of the songs were chopped off absolutely abruptly too. Not to mention that their placement makes no sense whatsoever. And what a waste of Malaika Arora's dancing skills! Why did they refuse to spend on decent choreography instead of the cameraman's voyeurism? Okay, you don't need to answer that.I trash another slapstick. What more could you expect from a person who can't enjoy masala movies even after disowning logic?

The rest of the film is tacky with a story line that's all over the place. ,"Any intrigue that the witty dialogue and unusual story line from the trailer might have created is thwarted with the tacky opening credit sequence and loud initial few minutes. Yet a hopeful viewer waits for the real story to kick in. Even when that happens, it doesn't take off from there and that is a real shame. Because, the premise could really have been exploited – both because it is new and by itself has a lot of meat that can be sliced and diced in many different ways - the two Indians find themselves in Pakistan.But, the route chosen – loud and all-over-the-place – is more a reminder of a run-of-the-mill Hindi slapstick that has neither head nor tail and just meanders about. Instead, you'd expect more satire from a movie that has such a political context. Welcome 2 Karachi botches up individual scenes that could have been remarkably funny, insightful and satirical too. Usually, with Arshad Warsi in the mix, you are at the very least guaranteed good comic timing. While there are a couple of laugh out loud moments (especially if you haven't seen the trailer), for the rest, Arshad Warsi comes across as loud and insufferable. Jacky Bhagnani brings in a laugh or two too, but I couldn't figure out why he seemed drunk through the film. While I understand, he was supposedly playing stupid, he came across more as a stupid person who sways a little too much for a person who has had his last drink a few days ago. Again, these few scenes that work, have no context whatsoever.Similarly, I understand films of this nature work on shoe-string budgets. Even so, the production is too tacky. We have many a example to show that limited resources do not necessarily have to mean cheap/cheesy visuals. Welcome 2 Karachi ends up being one of those that make you go, “What on earth is going on!?”and even when you are expecting the worst you want to yell, “This is not what I had signed up for.”

At interval, a tentative girl apologized to the boy accompanying her to the movie and asked if he wanted to leave. That was the only thing that made me laugh while watching Welcome Back. ","I think, I've seen it all now. Dimple Kapadia goes all slapstick-y. A fine actor turns to over-the-top acting to play an  ill-defined character. Nothing else can be as repulsive.  By now, we have gotten used to some of the other actors – Paresh Rawal, Nana Patekar and even Naseeruddin Shah once in a while - showing up in a film that considers even scratching the surface of their acting capabilities a crime. Getting a dignified actress like Dimple Kapadia to do so feels like a hit under the audience's belt. It doesn't come as a surprise that she is the most restrained of them all. The other two main women in the film, Shruti Haasan and Ankita Srivastava are miraculously both central to the plot and completely irrelevant. If you can call a reformed goons, Uday (Nana Patekar) and Majnu (Anil Kapoor) finding himself a new sister to be married off a plot at all. In the first hour of the film or so, there seemed to be some coherence because everything that happened somehow revolved around getting the sister or themselves married. After a couple of rounds of sexual objectification and standing up against it, it all boils down to one thing – getting married.Even the bigger goon, Wanted, yeah, that's his name (Naseeruddin Shah) is also focussed on getting his son married off. The son, is played by no less than Shiney Ahuja, wh o goes over board in being over board about anything he does in the film. As the movie moves into its last half hour or so though, everything becomes more and more bizarre. By now, the writers have even stopped trying to make sense. Sure, that was only a matter of time.  I really don't know what to say. Why anyone thinks any of this is even remotely funny, I don't understand. Even the one-liners are WhatsApp forwards. A couple rare lines bring a smile. Sure, there were a few laughters in the theater. But, if I had to guess it would be more because they were laughing at the film rather than with it.

The style of narration is a bit artificial but makes for an interesting watch.,"""Knock-knock""
""Anyone there?""
""You...you the multiplex cine-goer...yeah, yeah you - we've made this for you...a collage of the horrors that the interiors of the country suffers from...
""Worry not dearies, we've masked it with a dose of humor to make it palatable.""Yes, Welcome to Sajjanpur is here to educate us of the situation in rural India, with a slightly patronizing tone. And it does a good job of it too. The seriousness is toned down with wit albeit slapsticky at a few places. It tries to sensitize without being overtly sensitive. Which is why villagers might find their issues being trivialized.  Issues that they have to grapple with in on a day-to-day basis. Without any qualms, the movie refuses to offer solutions. ""That's not our job"", it says. We have just taken it upon ourselves to let you know this is what's happening in there. Look here, a mere signature is literacy in the census, animal rights are taking precedence over human livelihood, ""widow remarriage"" is a privilege. Sure, you knew that superstition and blind faith seep through the country's veins, that 'politician' is synonymous with 'goon' and farmers sell organs to keep afloat. But, might as well reinforce their existence. Oh, by the way, while we are at it, let us remind you that there is no need to shake off a eunuch with disgust! You know what, though, all these things don't necessarily have to end badly, there are alternative outcomes.That's a whole lot of ground to cover. Using one or two colorful, relatively well-etched out characters each, Benegal highlights issue after issue to form the montage of a village, Sajjanpur. The narrative tone topped up with a border-line loud Shreyas Talpade started getting to me in the first 10 minutes. And throughout, I was wondering, ""why this tone?"" Why are characters disappearing? My suggestion, don't be fidgety like me, there's a reason for that and you'll know when you need to know. Similarly, the songs add to the unrealistic feel. Besides doing their bit to maintain the light tone of the film, they are the way they are for a reason. I'd just enjoy the rhythm that adds to the mood of the village - this group of people who don't lose their smile despite the trying circumstances.Flipside, of course, is that they add to the length of the movie. And that's one place where Welcome to Sajjanpur misses the mark big time. It needed to be at least 15-20 minutes shorter. And this is despite the climax being rushed up. Maybe they were just trying something different in the narrative style, but it felt like a quick fix.The other thing was the accent. For some reason, it came across as forced. One reason could be that Rajeshwari Sachdev and Amrita Rao have a city-bred image that is difficult to shake off. Add to that the fact that they show up in non-village-like attire every once in a while. While Amrita was charming as the wife pining for her husband to come back to her, Rajeshwari looked really uncomfortable in the whole set-up. Smart-alec with a heart, Mahadev (Shreyas Talpade), keeps you curious throughout. How is he going to put his emotions in the next letter he writes for one of the villagers? You want his dreams to come true, however murky the morals behind them be. Am I the only one who thinks Shreyas does an Amol Palekar every once in a while? Each of the other cast members too adds his/her flavor to the village ambience. But, one who stood out was Ila Arun. I can so imagine her as one of my aunts from my native village. You read the newspaper and go on with your day. You'll, in all probability, watch this movie, maybe applaud the effort, and go on with your life. There will be no long-lasting impact, but maybe, just maybe the stories will stay with you.

Well done Abba reminds us of that and more. It reminds us of the gravity, the irony and our own submissiveness to the whole do. Would have worked much better if it were about an hour shorter.","Anyone who has spent even a little time in trying to get any work done from a corrupt, bureaucratic government will relate with the film. The issue at hand here might be more serious and even larger, but it's easy to identify with the protagonists, Armaan Ali (Boman Irani) and Muskaan (Minissha Lamba). A standard beginning that sets the tone for the narrative; a slow and frustrating build-up - as if we should feel the characters' emotions; an interesting twist post-interval; a few irrelevant sub-plots; and an out-of-place climax make the film just about watchable.The only reason to watch the film would be to take a peek into the exasperating process of getting any administrative work done that involves government approvals and the trick used to show the system the mirror. The funniest bit is that, like one would expect, the the bureaucrats' and politicians' completely see through the point. Master stroke in the sotry-writing department. The most fascinating element for me in the film was the Andhra accent in which Hindi is spoken. It completely highlights the rural setting too. Having spent a lot of my summer vacations in that region, the language brought along its share of nostalgia and thus fondness. That doesn't make the language or dialect consistent, but it is used well in large parts. The dialogues are plain-speak and yet not the boring types. They keep you engaged through. The other department that makes this film worth its while is the performances. Minissha Lamba is simply brilliant as the strong-headed village girl. Both, her language and her looks are completely in tune with her character. Boman Irani too is completely convincing, but we wouldn't have suspected that anyway, right? The put-offs though were the various side-plots. The milieu here is very similar to that in Welcome to Sajjanpur by the same director. But the not-so-main stories in that one were extremely engaging. Here they are extremely annoying. Right from the Engineers lust for his wife, to the woman-trade, to the look-alike brother. They took away more than what they added to the ambience. These plots also lengthened the film by a lot more than what could have been a brilliant light film on a serious issue. Though they might have served the purpose of adding a few more smiles because I did hear a lot of laughter from the audience. I'd suggest a wait until the movie is out on TV/DVD just because it does call for the patient audience in you. The treatment given to the dry subject is refreshing and won't be a complete waste of time.

627,1327,1327,1327,1327,West Is West,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review6 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/west-west-review/,,3/5.0,,2.833333333,"After a point, Om Puri’s – or the Asian in question's - mispronunciations, jokes on cow shit, and overall conflict between the west and east becomes a mosh of recycled plot points and jokes. West is West offers nothing new, it’s a passable watch for when you’re bored on a weekend and want to be amused but it shouldn’t be taken as anything more than that.  ","It’s raining sequels this season; you should buy an additional umbrella that can hold that burden. It’s not new to love an original and to have a sequel forced down your throat. Ayub Khan-Din scripted East is Easy in 1999 was one of the first British-Asian films to open the possibilities of that amusing premise - an Indian family living in the west and more such idiosyncrasies. The kids of the Khan family have it worse. Their mom is English and dad is a Pakistani patriarch. After a successful run, the movie opened up a good avenue for West is West  – which had some promising promos.
West is West  is like a hangover, no pun intended. It’s formulaic, and predictable. In West is West, Om Puri brings his youngest son, Sajid (Aqib Khan) to Pakistan because he feels he needs to inculcate some Pakistani culture into him. He deports him to his First wife’s home in a village in Pakistan where he hopes that Sajid will learn some values and morals. It all turns upside down when his holiday turns into a nostalgic overstay and Sajid begins to settle as a village boy. Barring a few scenes here and there, the movie drags and the latter half becomes preachy and boring. Om Puri has a comic charm, which lasts for about 45 mins of the film after which you can almost foresee every event play out. The scenes that are funny, stand alone – jibes at the multiple relations in a Muslim household, lifestyle shifts between England and Pakistan, all make for hilarious 5-minute scenes. You could watch them on youtube over and over and be amused, but added to a film and it gets lost in the whirlpool. Quick note about the soundtrack of the film – the Sufi sound will make you feel like you’re listening to Coke Studio, coupled with a few scenes that describe the serenity of Sufi music only to be best experienced in this side of the world. It’s a well-executed vision, provided a peaceful respite to the otherwise confused commotion of the film. Director Andy De-Emmony isn’t looking to expose to his audience to the harsh realities of British Muslims – it’s not a deep film. You can laugh, and light-heartedly pull through 2 hours and walk out feeling amused but it gets stuck somewhere between a drama and a comedy. To top it all, West is West is also sprinkled with a few run-of-the-mill Asian, cultural stereotypes. It’s a film that has a confused target audience and confused genre – and a cinematic confusion is not the same as a confused identity that stands on its own as a fundamental for culturally mixed films. If anything, West is West  gives a preachy and only brief account of the theme that is quite rich for any Brit-Asian comedy: an identity crisis.The characters are strong, be it English wife Ella (Linda Bassett) Sajid’s mother, George Khan (Om Puri) or even Ila Arun as Puri’s first wife – but together they only make for a passable watch. West is West  is not a bad film, it’s enjoyable for a lazy watch, but I would recommend the much funnier and sharper prequel East is East. It serves the same purpose better if you’re looking for a lazy watch.

628,1328,1328,1328,1328,What to Expect When You're Expecting,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review,/movie/what-expect-when-youre-expecting-review/,,,,2.833333333,"The biggest disappointment in What to Expect When You’re Expecting is its lack of ambition. The film revels in its predictability, making no attempt to try a different brand of humour or a different revelation of human experience. While some moments have the potential to make you laugh, for the most part the movie is banal and unsatisfactory.","What you expect from What to Expect When You’re Expecting doesn’t falter one bit through the 110 minutes of the film. The film is adapted by the non-fiction book of the same name and its main draw, much like other ensemble films like He’s Just Not that Into You and New Year’s Eve is the variety of familiar faces, (gorgeous Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lopez playing pregnant woman who look cosmetically flawless) virtually no character-viewer relationship, some funny moments and a predictable story-line. Based in New York, the film graphs seven couples who have one thing in common - they’re all having a baby. Soon they realize that pregnancy is harder than they imagined. The many characters include Cameron Diaz, a fitness guru celebrity who winds up with an unexpected pregnancy. While Jennifer Lopez finds trouble adopting a child after having difficulty in conceiving, Elizabeth Banks preaches on a perfect pregnancy but all her rules go topsy-turvy when she’s expecting, and Chace Crawford (Gossip girl fame) and Anna Kendrick (of the Twilight saga) play ex-lovers who reunite to result in an accidental pregnancy. The movie does have its funny moments though – mostly to Elizabeth Bank’s credit, where she plays the uptight mommy-to-be who becomes a chaotic mess by the d-day. Her trail is the funniest to follow, and you find yourself waiting for her bit to pop up amidst the ensemble. On the flipside, most of the humor adopted for the bigger stars like Diaz and Lopez seem repetitive and remind you of an American sitcom.The film, predictably so, relies on many clichés - the beautiful first touch of a new-born baby, the surge of emotions that a mommy-to-be faces and the parallel track of the husbands, which I would have preferred to be more inclusive. As it is, the husbands are quite negligible, and much to our disappointment most of the couple are pretty straightforward. No gay couple or even inter-racial couples for that matter. A cultural or homosexual complexity while having a child could have provided fodder for further humor. The film unfolds mostly through predictable background score and you can virtually check off every cliché being used in the film: every trouble is eventually justified with the larger joy of being a mother, the character who has the most trouble ends up with the happiest ending and the actual act of conceiving is as glamorous and colorful as the posters of the film. Being the biggest stars in the film, Lopez and Diaz mostly disappoint with the plastic performances.If what you’re looking for is a happy-fun film with many faces and characters I suggest you rent Love Actually. What to Expect When You’re Expecting is a disappointment.

629,1329,1329,1329,1329,What's your rashee?,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewNotepad45 Critic Reviews 1.1/5.0 4 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/whats-your-rashee-review/,1.1/5.0,3/5.0,,2.133333333,This one is a complete package for Ms. Chopra lovers. The rest - story / songs / execution - all are just about o-kay. And mainly because it requires this WARNING! It is all of 3.5 hours. An option is to treat is as 2 proper length films or 12 short films,"Let's get the obvious complaint out of the way. What's you Rashee? is long, super-long, super-duper long. No. Just ""super-duper long"" wouldn't be enough. It needed that build-up, it's that long! AND despite that, it's not an outright bad film, but it keeps it from being an ""undoubtedly great"" one. Oh, well…Let' get the second-most obvious thing about the film. This time a sure positive one. PRIYANKA CHOPRA. I'm usually more than okay with people not agreeing with my opinion of a film/performance/etc. But, I will be really surprised if there are more than meager handfuls who won't like Priyanka Chopra in this film. I had enough guys going siggggh and gals going wow (including me) every time she was on screen. Her performance(s) were brilliant one charming character after another. The third-most…Gotchya! You didn't think I was giving you a list of top 12 things about What's your rashee?, were you? But if I were to do that I'd guarantee, each paragraph sounded and talked about different things. Which is not what the 12 Priyanka characters do here. Yes, almost each of the 12 characters is charming, and a couple of them are very different from the norm. But the rest follow a format. There's something they want their groom-to-be or not-to-be to know and each Priyanka's 10 minutes of screen-time revolves around that issue. And this is extremely interesting for the first few times and obviously tiring after that. And the two that are different are too exaggerated to be true. Which is pretty much true of the entire story-line too. But the basic premise has been forgiven since we are already there to watch the film, right? And despite that we are asked for more. We have to accept the dad's selfishness and the brother's foolishness, the silly pundit and weird uncle, the prop sister-in-law and the I'm-here-to-lengthen-the-film aunt. Ooops! I almost forgot Harman Baweja. I surprise myself when I want to say, I think this guy can do well. He needs a chance where he's not over-shadowed by his star co-star. But, this one is all about the woman, right? Wrong. My issue with these so-called women-oriented films is also that they are well ""so-called"". While each one of the characters is today's girl with a mind of her own, it looks superficial. Because, she's still out for the man's support in needing what she wants and each one's approach is convoluted. And if there was ever a ""throw me around from one guy to the other, how do I care which man I want to get married to"", this is the one. Wait for the climax to react to this comment. This is what the writer's thinking process looks like. 
""Yo! Priyanka Chopra is one helluva actor. She needs a film that revolves under her character."" 
. 
. 
. 
""But, we don't know how to write women-centric stories. Damn! That too for someone with a star stature."" 
. 
. 
. 
""Let's go through options that we can explore. 7 days of the week, naah - sounds ridiculous. 31 days of the month - way too many. So 365 days a year is out of the question….hmmm…""
. 
. 
 Research - research - research  (am I giving too much credit? Well, the same man made the supposedly extensively researched Jodhaa Akbar, didn't he? Anyway... 
. 
. 
""Hey, look here's this Gujrati novel Kimball Ravenswood by Madhu Rye. Yay! Jackpot And they made a TV series out of the same theme and it was pretty popular, remember? Mr. Yogi? ""
. 
. 
. 
""Done, then! Since we've to get Priyanka to act real well, and she'll sell. The director can leave the rest of the cast to do their own thing, snort, fart, smile, whine, whatever. And he can focus on just the lady."" 
. 
. 
. 
""Hey, wait! 12 girls one after the other without a break will become monotonous. Let's throw in a couple of side-stories. Which ones? Don't matter. Say a Don theme and an extra-marital affair theme. It'll just break the flow for a bit. Doesn't sound good? I said ""Don't matter!!"" It don't matter even if we don't give them a closure. You just watch…""

""What else? It's masala no? We need songs. How many? Of course 12! Can't have any less, what if any one of Bhavna, Hansa, Anjali, Chandrika, Sanjana, etc, etc, etc feel bad? Can't risk that!"" And so we have what we have. An extremely mediocre product if it were not for Ms. Piggy Chops. True, the songs are nice, very well-picturized and different too. But after the 3rd one it gets a little blah! And when there are so many, songs with lip-sync involved they sound repetitious too. Gone are the days Mr. Gowariker when the Hindi film audience thought found their money's worth only if the film touched the 180-minute mark. Rest assured we, the audience, won't think any less of you if your movie doesn't move the average run-time of films around the world by a notch. Yet, it's not boring. So, viewers will be better equipped to handle its length at home with the luxury of the ""fast forward"" switch at their disposal for the non-Priyanka parts, of course. Oh yeah and the opening credits are one of the best I've seen in Hindi films!

A simple, uncomplicated film about taxi driver Hari and his wedding, the film otherwise doesn’t offer much else, because of the manner in which the filmmakers have adhered to their objective – the story of when Hari got married.","Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam’s documentary When Hari Got Married is a simple and unassuming film that follows 30-year old taxi driver Hari in the lead up to his arranged marriage. While the film does warm your heart, I’m still grappling with whether I want to recommend the film or not.Hari is set to marry a young girl named Suman. Though the couple doesn’t ever get the chance to spend any time together prior to their marriage, Hari manages to get hold of Suman’s phone number. Thus ensuring at least some level of ‘courtship’. The phone conversations that Hari has with Suman and Hari’s narration of his experiences as he goes through with the wedding preparations make you smile. Hari is resourceful and smart, yes. But he is also a simpleton, almost naïve. (Then again, that naivety may only be an urban writer’s perception of him, based on a few nuggets of his life captured on video.) As the film follows Hari and we acquaint ourselves with his uncomplicated worldview, we see just how traditional most of India still is.In fact, traditionalism and conservativeness apart, what comes through the most in the film is just how deep gender biases have penetrated our society. Suman, for example, properly sets eyes on Hari for the first time when she is actually getting married to him. It is endearing and a little heart-breaking to think of that diminutive little woman getting ready to spend her life with a man who she wouldn’t recognize unless he was pointed out to her.Even Hari, a good man no doubt, still seems to think that the wedding is an ordeal for the man more than the woman. He gives off the air of someone who is about to accept a burden more than anything else. And it isn’t his fault really; it is about his surroundings and where he comes from.Credit, then, to the filmmakers Sarin and Sonam, who don’t try to milk the story for any sensationalism or for highlighting any burning issues plaguing small-town India. Their focus is Hari and his wedding, and everything else is about the flavour and texture of all that goes with it and the place and culture of where the film is set. The film, then, is more like a wedding video than anything else.And that, primarily, is what causes me to be unsure of how much I should recommend this film. It is honest, endearing and mature, but what does one truly take away from the film, apart from the fact that we know Hari and Suman had an arranged marriage? Little else, to be honest. Personally speaking, though, I’m glad that I now know about the existence of Hari, Suman and their angelic daughter somewhere in the hills of Dharamsala; because they will find a place in my prayers henceforth.

Where is The Friend’s Home  is like visual poetry, recited by Ahmed, the protagonist about his adventures to a neighbouring village. More than coaxing you to watch the film because it’ll be one of the best you’d have seen, it’s more a small part of innocence that you should revisit. You might be able to retain it for a couple of hours after the film. ","If you check your inbox from the early 2000s, you would definitely find one of those cheesy, forwarded emails that gives you a pictorial list of the most precious things on earth. You know, the smell of rain, the dewdrop on a rose and yes ofcourse, a child’s innocence. Before you cringe at the thought of it, you should know that Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami’s Where is The Friend’s Home will break that cringe and make you fall in love with the concept of innocence all over again.Where is The Friend’s Home  is set in rural Iran, and tells us a simple story of a small boy who travels all the way to another village to return his friend’s notebook. We are introduced to the atrocities of small-town education that relies on it’s strict discipline, sort reminiscent of Truffaut’s 400 Blows. We walk through our protagonist Ahmed’s life, to find that at the end of a hard day at school, he happened to bring his friend’s notebook home. Well aware of the consequences of not finishing your homework in your notebook, Ahmed decides to visit the neighbouring village to return his notebook. Only, he doesn’t know the way. But that doesn’t stop Ahmed; his empathy towards his friends pulls him beyond selfish logic and we follow him on his journey to the neighbouring village. The picture of Where is The Friend’s Home is stunning, in a simplistic way. While we follow Ahmed, we walk with him through unknown zig-zag roads, amidst the rural landscape of Iran. Much like most Iranian films, we venture on a poetic, visual journey coupled with a middle-eastern stringed background score and a slow-paced rhythmic movement towards the friend’s home. By the end of the journey, you feel you know Ahmed much more than his parents of the elders, like you and Ahmed share a secret bond, of the pleasures of expedition you got to accompany him on. So much so, that the 83 minutes whiz by even though most of the film is shot on real time. Ahmed and the elders in a village have the conventional conflict in their ideologies. We see a more experimental, innocent yet observant viewpoint of Ahmed juxtaposed with the traditional values of his mother or his grandfather. But you don’t have to make a choice. You’re never made to leave Ahmed’s side. The DVD of Where is The Friend’s Home has no special features but it comes in a pack of three – The Koker Trilogy, which also includes And Life Goes On and Through The Olive Trees. All three are based in the village Koker, and surround the same characters. Yet with Where is The Friend’s Home you won’t feel like you watched a film. You’ll have transported yourself on Ahmed’s shoulder for 83 mins, walking and contemplating and absorbing every bit of his experience. I would ask you to explore the child-like innocence in you with this film, or realize the beauty of a simple story but as the cliché goes, the film offers you much more. It’s like you’ve been made to close your eyes and visualize a story being played out as a young Iranian boy narrates it to you. How you chose to visualize Where is The Friend’s Home becomes your viewing experience of the film. It’s really that beautifully simple.

Doused with cheese, imbecility trumps all in a film where you actually end up feeling sorry for America at the end of it, never mind the fact that its jingoistic patriotism comes to its rescue after all.","Unbelievable, really. Barely a few months after Antoine Fuqua’s Gerard Butler-starrer, Olympus Has Fallen, disgraced the big screen with its cheesy, jingoistic, all-American, guiltily indulgent ludicrousness, Roland Emmerich gives us White House Down - a film with, yes, almost the exact same plot, just with the asininity up several notches. The White House is taken over by terrorists, as simple as that. At least Olympus Has Fallen tried to maintain a level of respect towards the constitution and the office of the President of the United States of America. White House Down, though, is all-out idiocy of an astonishing level. It dials up absolutely everything idiotic about Olympus, adds in more than a few puerile moments of its own, and serves us a harebrained film that trips over its own preposterousness while trying to outrun its own half-wittedness. This is the kind of film where a lollipop-sucking computer hacker gets to work only after setting up a Beethoven symphony, and where an affable White House tour guide miraculously manages to invoke Arnold Schwarzenegger when a shotgun comes his way. Now Roland Emmerich has never been known to make particularly intelligent films anyway, preferring to use his $100-million-plus budgets to blow things up or making things come crashing down. Incidentally, with his last film Anonymous, made on a measly $30 million budget, it seemed like he was beginning to tilt slightly towards some substance in his films. That one was, for me, his best film to date despite it being just as outlandish as his usual work. But he’s back with big-budget vengeance and how! Channeling his inner Abbas & Mastan, Emmerich packs the plot in with a twist a minute, completely avoids any space-time coherence, provides ace military-grade stealth skills to an eleven-year old girl, takes special care to ensure that none of the thousand-odd bullets fired at our heroes ever touches them and packs the film with inane humour throughout its runtime; so much so that I’m hard-pressed to not slot this film as a comedy. It also pretends to be a coming of paternal-age drama at times, and it is here when it becomes particularly hard to not gag.The real travesty of this film is how some really fine actors are given such thankless characters to enact. Jamie Foxx as POTUS collects every ounce of Barack Obama’s poise and statesmanship, so that he can chew it all up like a giant bubblegum and spit it out onto the front lawn of the White House, ensuring that he carries absolutely none of it into the film. He’d have made for an amusing sidekick janitor at the White House in another film. As the ‘leader of the free world’ though - as he once refers to himself in this one - he does best when he isn’t on screen.Jason Clarke, coming off the back of three terrific turns in Lawless, Zero Dark Thirty and The Great Gatsby, is saddled with a negative role far beneath his talent and presence. Maggie Gyllenhaal goes so over-the-top that you wish more than once that she had stayed dead after The Dark Knight. Channing Tatum as an aspiring Secret Service agent who’s trying his best to impress his daughter, offers up a measure of macho schoolboy charm, but there is only so much he can do to keep a straight face during all of what’s happening around him.White House Down is the kind of film that you stop taking seriously very soon, hoping that it will turn out to at least be a brisk, fun film. Alas, it rarely becomes anything more than a good exercise at testing just how many synonyms of the word ‘moronic’ you can think of.

How I wish the rest of the movie was executed that skillfully too. For die-hard movie buffs just the first few minutes make it a must-watch in theatre. For the less-inclined, there are good moments, but there is no glitter-dance-colour-cinematography. Certainly wait for a somber mood to see this one. All songs other than the one in the second half have good music and beautiful poetry. 
No one need tell the story – thanks to the marketing department that left no stone unturned in publicizing it as the Mahesh Bhatt-Parveen Babi love story. The story leaves a pretty big gap which makes you feel cheated. It feels like the first half is made with so much devotion and involvement that suddenly, the team wakes up…oops!!!…no time and money left to say it all, so let’s skip this part here. 
Shiney Ahuja has given a laudable performance. You really feel for him right till the end.  Kangna Ranaut’s dialogue delivery needs polishing, a lot of it! Also, either the dubbing is off, or she is trying to hide a lisp. The role required someone to shed clothes, and they found someone who had no inhibitions whatsoever, so what if even after make-up her face looks patchy. 
Almost everything loses its way after half time. The reasonable dialogues are followed by inane ones. Really charged scenes give way to drab direction. The screenplay loses the slickness it had in the first half. Also, while some aspects of schizophrenia have been portrayed very well, others like side effects of medication, why a patient resists medication, etc are completely ignored. 
This is one of those two-hours-and-a-few-minutes movies which makes you feel you have been sitting in that seat for more than three hours. If the audience is laughing out loud at serious scenes, you know they have been there too long. 
Am I being insensitive by calling a supposedly sincere attempt to pay a tribute to Parveen Babi a marketing strategy? My thought while leaving the cinema hall – can anyone who was so deeply in love, make an exhibition out of it?

A crazy ride of questionable morals, The Wolf of Wall Street shows us the escapades of a greedy libertine in a manner that makes you see through your own righteousness. Entertaining, hilarious and downright vulgar, Scorsese at the helm and DiCaprio's turn as the titular character make for quite a film. ","We live rather tame lives, if you really think about it. Years of conditioning about what's right and what's wrong; the pangs of guilt or, alternatively, the adrenaline rush one gets when one crosses a moral 'line'; passing moral judgements about the other; penance for one's 'sins'; the works. Humanity lives by a code of ethics that, at least for the most part, seems to work for us.  But then, who really writes this 'code'? Who makes the rules, and if we go by the fundamental premise that all of humankind is equal, then who's to say what defines right and wrong in the first place? After all, one man's food is another man's poison. Consequently, there will always be those who live life by their own rules, all notions of morality be damned. These people, usually, are the ones who aren't accountable for their Aston Martins.Enter Jordan Belfort - Wall Street stockbroker and salesman extraordinaire - a man who made millions by laundering fraudulent stocks to unsuspecting investors. A self-styled Robin Hood who took wealth from the rich and gave it to... Himself! A man who made so much money that he didn't mind throwing cash in the trash, just for kicks.Based on the book 'The Wolf of Wall Street' written by the real life Belfort himself, Martin Scorsese's film adaptation of the scamster's life is an astonishingly audacious piece of cinema - both in content as well as execution. With the film largely based on fact, one can't help but be overwhelmed by just how obscene Belfort's greed, depravity, lasciviousness and lust for money was; and that lust just grew bigger with each additional million he made. Jordan Belfort didn't just push the limits of morality, he ignored them completely, seeming to live in an alternate dimension where morality as a concept just didn't exist.Then there's what Martin Scorsese has done with Belfort's story. Call it glorification, call it treating a serious issue with a far lighter tone than can be considered appropriate, or call it sheer masterclass in adopting a cinematic style that will work best with the written word - either way, Scorsese knocks this one out of the park the way only he can.Directed with a kind of fervent energy that one hasn't seen from the great man in a while, The Wolf of Wall Street is cinema on crack. Outrageously funny, incredibly daring in terms of how it never shies away from going deeper and deeper into the realms of 'immorality', briskly paced to the extent that one never realizes its monstrous runtime, and phenomenally performed to boot, The Wolf of Wall Street will either be the most fun you've had at the cinemas in a while, or if the vulgarity of Belfort's excesses begin to get to you, it can also be the most taxing experience in recent times.Because make no mistake, neither Martin Scorsese nor his terrific cast have held themselves back with this one; they've gone all out to bring you characters that make you question everything you believe in. Sex, violence, drugs, language, corruption, immorality and everything considered taboo are actually celebrated with uncontrolled licentiousness in the film. In fact, despite the fact that the film has been released in India with a good six minutes chopped off, I still couldn't help wonder how the censors were mature enough to let the film release at all - not that I'm complaining. It is rated as an adult film, obviously, but I know for a fact that even many 'adults' will find it hard to stomach the level of all-round immodest extravagance of sin that has been depicted in the film.Of the cast, Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort and Jonah Hill as his aide Donnie give their characters their unbridled all. DiCaprio, in particular, must be saluted for pumping Belfort with a quality that makes him seem 'normal', despite his excesses. They should be someone we despise, but we are never allowed to take a moral stance with them. DiCaprio - and Scorsese, of course, - make you an unsuspecting participant in everything that you would ideally consider 'wrong', which consequently shakes you off from your own moral high ground, bringing your self-righteousness crashing down.Questions will be asked, of course. Is it right to glorify something that is so obviously 'wrong'? Should there have been a stronger focus on highlighting that sin must always be atoned for; that karma will come back to bite you in the backside some day? Is a film like The Wolf of Wall Street irresponsible towards society, because it seems to make heroes out of people who should be considered as villains? These are all points of view, which, while important to talk about, actually are a disservice to the intent of the film altogether. Because, whether we like it or not, the world is very clearly run by all the Belforts out there - the ones who are 'more equal' than the others. Scorsese daringly shows us that even these people are human, and by making an enjoyable film out of Belfort's story, he shows us that if we were in Jordan Belfort's shoes, we would probably have been no different. We're all, in some way or the other, wolves in human clothing.

635,1335,1335,1335,1335,[The] Wolverine,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/wolverine-review/,,5/5.0,,3.633333333,"Hugh Jackman returns as The Wolverine, and he is one of the key reasons why the film made for a better watch than I expected it to be. Simply by holding back on action sequences and focusing more on character, director James Mangold has made a film that just seems different from the typical films of this genre.","No matter how strong or how fast you get, you just can’t outrun your own inner demons. And Logan has stranger, darker demons, and for far longer to boot, than most other people – if you can classify him under ‘people’, that is. The brooding, sombre mutant is back, and he’s still being haunted by the ghosts of his past.Despite Logan being, by some distance, my personal favourite character from the X-Men series, I must confess that I didn’t have too many expectations from The Wolverine, because there have been far too many X-Men films coming out far too soon, than the world strictly requires. Besides, a few years back, director James Mangold managed to do the impossible by making the first and only Tom Cruise film I dislike, in Knight and Day. I’m unsure, then, if it was my low expectations or the fact that it actually is a film with its own merit, but I quite enjoyed The Wolverine. For one, it has far lesser action than one has come to expect from an X-Men film, or indeed, a film based on any Marvel/DC character or world. The film focuses more on Logan, the character - a mutant whose gravest problems stem from deep within – from his past, his present and his seemingly perpetual future. With the film being set in Japan – mostly in Tokyo, before moving to the outskirts, The Wolverine also has a flavour of Japan that is undoubtedly superficial, but one that works in its favour. Capturing the flavour of a country or city that has its own distinctive culture is largely unexplored territory for a Hollywood film of this genre, and it thus makes for a refreshing change in this film.Indeed, the entire narrative of The Wolverine took me slightly aback with how much it focused on the character and his surroundings, rather on VFX-powered set pieces. The few of the latter that are there in the film are quite well executed as well, without bordering on action-porn, as films tend to do these days. Watch out, particularly, for an imaginative and riveting scene on the top of a thundering ‘Shinkansen’ – what is ubiquitously known as a Bullet train – again, something quite typical of Japan.It helps, of course, to have the towering presence of someone like Hugh Jackman to hold the film together. After Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, Jackman is the only other actor to have a made a comic book character so much his own that it’s hard to imagine anyone else playing it. Also, after watching his incredible turn as Jean Valjean in last year’s Les Misérables, my respect for him as an actor increased tremendously, and his intensity shines through in The Wolverine as well. Every performance around Jackman, though, is so stilted and effected that it jars. The pace of the narrative isn’t breakneck, and yet the film never pauses and lingers around pointlessly either. The runtime of just over two hours thus seems about perfect. To round it off, the film also looks good – despite a bleak, de-saturated colour tone, it makes generous use of solar flares, which always seem to improve the look of even an averagely shot film. The film has a wider 3D release than 2D, so it’s more likely that you’ll end up watching a 3D show. The 3D isn’t particularly great, but it doesn’t hamper the film either. Of course, there is the post-credits scene to look forward to as well, an intriguing little teaser for Bryan Singer’s X-Men: Days of Future Past, which is summer 2014’s big release. So, if you’re absolutely fed up of big franchise films that OD on VFX and action, then you could give The Wolverine a shot – it is a wee bit different from the usual. If nothing else, Logan - and Hugh Jackman - almost adamantly keep things interesting.

636,1336,1336,1336,1336,[The] Woman In Black,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/the-woman-in-black-review/,,3/5.0,,2.966666667,"It’s not a good thing if you spend most of the first half of the film thinking, Harry Potter is the protagonist of the film. Well, Harry Potter in a Victorian suit. Anyhow, The Woman in Black will distract you from its poor choices (casting Danielle Radcliffe primarily) with it’s well formulated horror sequences and thrilling visuals. Brace yourself. ","The Woman in Black, simplistic as the title is, will haunt you for a couple of minutes after you walk out of the theatre. That’s a sign of a successful horror film, some would say. The film reminds you of the 1960s horror films (the production house Hammer Films have quite the success run), with elaborate production design, familiar horror tropes and a plot that one can’t go wrong with, but in spite of spooking you successfully, there are quite a few bones one can pick. However, if horror is what you went in looking for, unadulterated horror is what you will get.Adapted from Susan Hill’s novel of the same name, The Woman in Black is set in the Victorian era where young attorney Arthur Kipps (Danielle Radclife) has to be sent to North England to sell a (haunted) house that is so cut away from the village, it can only be reached by a long marshy causeway that is covered by the sea during high tide. Arthur’s job is to revisit the house for the original occupant’s missing documents.Local legend has it that the house is haunted by a woman who mourns the death of her child, something the villagers did nothing to stop. Arthur realizes this could be the reason for the number of children dying in the village. He goes ahead with his job, despite of multiple warnings from the locals. We are introduced to his financial burden in the beginning, and even though that could be reason enough to go into a haunted house, Radcliffedoes a decent job in selling his curiosity to us, about the house and its story. It’s the idea that he is married man with a kid that doesn’t go down too well. You keep trying to understand, why they would cast Radcliffe for this part – was there a dearth of actors who looked 30 plus? Because Radcliffe most certainly does not. He also has that perennial expression on his face – the same kind that Harry Potter carried in his movies at every moment of looming danger. Minus points for repetitive acting and disbelief there.Having said that, the film’s production design reminds you of homes that genuinely give you the creeps – the kind of haunted houses that needn’t do much, while it’s play with light, shadows, rocking chairs and wound-up toys are enough to creep you out. In that sense The Woman in Black relies on old-school horror tricks, with creaking staircases, random glimpses of half-decomposed ghosts in black, doors shutting tight on their own. We could thank The Woman in Black for reminding us that we can get spooked by the simplest things. A good amount of spine-chilling visuals also add to your entire horror film experience. Cameraperson Tim Maurice-Jones knows what he needs to get the entire picture together – aerial shots of a misty sea in pure grey hues, shadowed forest trees and their play with light and your regular minimalistic piano for background music - and you’re gearing yourself for 95 minutes of periodic covering your eyes and jumping off your seat.

637,1337,1337,1337,1337,[The] World Before Her,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/tore-herhe-world-her-review/,,,,2.966666667,"Nisha Pahuja’s The World Before Her will make you uncomfortable, it will urge you to question what you know and believe, and it will shame you for being a part of a society that doesn’t fundamentally understand that men and women are equal; that such a question being raised itself is a mark of how undeserving humanity is of the world it inhabits.","Who decided that a woman must fight to prove herself worthy of existence? When was it decreed that women are, in any way at all, inferior to men; that their lives mean only to be daughters, wives and mothers? Why is that even today, in a world that has seen humankind create unbelievable miracles – so many of them by women – we still have to ‘reserve’ places for women in government or in other organizations? Why is it that even urban, educated India has different standards for men and women?I must have been all of 5, maybe less, when I first heard the ‘saying’ that behind every successful man there is a woman. It rankled back then, and it still does. We’ve all seen, over the years, how women are the ones blamed for ‘degrading  our culture’, chastised for ‘stepping out of their boundaries’, questioned for possessing ambition, and even physically attacked for ‘embracing Westernization’. If all of this sickens you, then Nisha Pahuja’s documentary, The World Before Her, will hit you in the gut. It hurts like few other films in the recent past.There are two extremes in India – the modern, urban, high-flying but often ugly world of unbridled personal ambition; and the traditional, conservative, fiercely insecure India that guards its past far more than it welcomes the future. The World Before Her juxtaposes the two, with the most objective possible view of the place of women in both worlds. Ruhi is a girl barely out of her teens, from semi-urban India; a girl who aims to make it big at the Miss India pageant. Prachi, on the other hand, is a young instructor at Durga Vahini, the women’s wing of Vishwa Hindu Parishad – the self-appointed custodians of Hinduism (or Hindutva, as they’d prefer to call it.)As we take a look at Ruhi’s journey – which represents that of so many like her – at the unforgiving, relentless training they have to undergo at beauty pageants, you can’t help but feel sorry for the fact that so much of a woman’s self-worth is determined by her external appearance. True, there are pageants for men as well, but they rarely ever claim the spotlight the way a beauty pageant for women does. So strange that a society so unashamedly patriarchal finds a competition that pits women against each other on the basis of their looks far more appealing than one for men.Prachi’s tale, on the other hand, scares you. Here is a girl who is thankful to her parents for letting her live despite being born a girl, because of which she willingly embraces harsh, physical punishments from her father; a girl who derives an almost perverse pleasure because of her power and domination over the young girls, many of them teenagers, who she trains at the Durga Vahini camps. There are times when these camps almost feel like militant training camps; their acceptance and belief in violence as a solution against the enemies of Hinduism – the big monotheistic religions of the world, Western culture and the likes.Most people will find sympathy in at least one of these faces of India. The ones who fall in the middle, those who feel uncomfortable by the questions that can be asked of both these schools of thought, are the ones who will be most affected by the film. Both these worlds, though starkly different from each other, find parallels in each other as well. Diction expert Sabira Merchant, who trains Miss India contestants on the way they speak during the preparation rounds for the pageant, refers to the pageants as ‘factories’, which churn out polished, modern Indian women. The Durga Vahini camps are also like factories, spawning hordes of women who can raise fight if the time calls for it. Both worlds have precise routines, specific methods and a rigid structure that participants just can’t break free of. While Ruhi, Prachi and the other girls we come across in the film are representative of the journeys that women like them follow, they also become characters we invest in. It is hard to miss the moistening of Ruhi’s eyes when she talks about her dream of becoming Miss India and making her parents proud. It is extremely difficult to not view Prachi with a mix of apprehension and sympathy, when she talks about how she hates girls who are too ‘girlish’. And do look closely at Ruhi’s face and the subtle changes you see in it as the film progresses – you’ll see how her Miss India preparation took a biologically-induced toll on her beautifully flawed natural face as well.Interestingly, the documentary is almost crafted like a thriller. It switches between the two worlds smoothly, and as it goes on, you’re almost holding your breath, wondering what happens of the women we meet in the film. You wait to see where their respective journeys lead them; and as the two paths merge into each other, you’re left stunned, but with nagging questions that will haunt you. Almost like how children, when looking at a television, wonder if they’re looking at people in a world inside a box, or if the people inside the box are looking at them and at the world outside.The film restricts itself to the way women are perceived in the two contrasting worlds, but if you think about it, it also questions the two worlds itself. Which is the real India? Is ‘Western culture’ a threat to our own rich heritage? Or is culture a dynamic and evolving construct that has no option but to change as time passes? How is it that a woman can stand before a massive audience comprised of other women, and fiercely speak of how a woman isn’t supposed to think of a ‘career’? On the other hand, in the so-called modern, liberal world of the pageants, the women are taught how to stand, walk, talk and twirl. Their legs are supposed to be a certain way, their chins are supposed to be a certain way. Fingers, toes, wrist, neck - everything has a fixed position to project confidence and personality. Doesn't sound so liberal now, does it?Another terrifying thought you take from the film is just how communally charged a country India is. Day-to-day life might seem peaceful, but that there literally are armies being trained by the majority community in the country is scary. It makes you wonder if the minorities have similar notions and ideas. All of this is simmering below a facade of relative harmony. When it will explode is anybody's guess.The World Before Her is the kind of film that you can write and talk about for longer than you can imagine. Hence, it is also an important film; the discomfort which it engenders being a measure of which face you represent, of the ugly world we live in.

638,1338,1338,1338,1338,World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/world-invasion-battle-los-angeles-review/,,3/5.0,,2.966666667,"The first of the many alien invasion movies to release this year, World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles is a mistake. Aliens are clearly still a soft spot to excite the folks at Columbia Tristar, but this one has got zilch characterisation and no layers in the storyline. Non-stop action, little breathing space for dialogue and all you’re left with, is a film ticket you regret having bought. ","World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles is a painful action movie to sit through. One of those films which makes you despair for worthy newcomers in the industry - great scripts which find no producers - and instead go into mindless special effects bonanzas like this one, all in the name of a science fiction film. Trouble is, the film takes itself seriously and you begin to look for the Exit sign in the theatre.The film is nothing but a 2-hour long action sequence, shot in a manner which Barkha Dutt’s cameraman would have shot the Kargil War: running, ducking from bombs and lasers, with absolutely no aesthetics to photography and no reason for slow motion. Some may argue that it takes the viewer in the centre of the action - and believe me it does, some laser bullets feel like they’re coming through the screen - but why would I want to be amongst a bunch of characters who adhere to the most terrible cliches of American film casting (an Asian, an African, a Latin American, etc) and possess nothing interesting to boast of, not even a sense of humour.The dialogue in the film is mostly incomprehensible - the most common ones being “Move!! Move!! Move!!”, ‘Watch out!!”. I get the feeling that the sound design artist, responsible for creating sounds of gunshots and bomb explosions, must have charged - you guessed it right - a bomb. Action overcomes everything else in this film, which doesn’t even make a lame attempt at explaining logic.Americans are known to be proud of their Armed forces - the Marines - and this film is another attempt at glorifying their role in the middle of any crisis. When the world is suddenly faced with an alien invasion, Captain Nantz (Aaron Eckhart, in a solid performance) and his platoon do everything they can to save a bunch of civilians in Santa Monica, even as major cities across the world attacked by a meteor shower that brings along aliens. Any sense into the whys and hows of the invasion is made clear by edgy news reports - some say it is a colonization, some say they’re here for our water. All this could have been depicted through a new character of a scientist/expert on these things, but director Jonathan Liebesman (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Darkness Falls) and writer Christopher Bertolini (The General’s Daughter) decide to skip all such formalities and focus only on the platoon instead. The result is a film where the characters are just shooting aliens, and some more aliens and some more.Alien invasion films got a new life a couple of years back, when Peter Jackson produced District 9 - it was classy, made globally significant statements about colonization, evacuation and humanity, all in CNN-style again. But it managed to touch a chord somewhere, through more developed characterisation and the docu-drama feel. It was so much more believable. Heck, even the aliens looked better designed. Which means, there’s always a way to make an alien invasion movie interesting. Apocalypse itself is a great theme to draw people into theatres (2012 was a huge success in India and Rolland Emerich continues to make movies on the same theme) - we all want to indulge in that one scary fantasy of how it would feel like to see the world come to an end. Despite being done to death, the success of District 9 showed that aliens still continue to fascinate us, provided there are interesting characters and there’s finesse involved in their making. World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles could have won some brownie points had it tried telling the story through the eyes of the civilians - that way, we’d have got a sense of why Americans love the Marines so much. We don’t know what aliens look like, but why not add some quirks to their character design? This film’s aliens look plain ugly, as do their spaceships and it becomes apparent that not too much time and thought has been spent on them.This special effects film looks good when it begins - the overhead shots of the coastline under attack looks breathtaking, but after a point the novelty of all those explosions wears off and you’re just waiting for the film to end. So I’m at my sarcastic best when I say that it’s a great movie to go for, on a date. The theatres will be empty.

The film stays watchable because of a continuous stream of scenes that will startle or thrill you, because of Brad Pitt's angsty (if weary) leading man, and because of some decent technical execution.  ","Director Marc Forster has steadily built up a solid little CV that has a number of watchable, if not really interesting, films. Though not quite in the league of some of his better work -Finding Neverland and Monster's Ball, for example - his latest film, the long-in-production zombie-actioner World War Z, surprisingly doesn't exactly do his filmography much harm either. World War Z is what you get when Steven Sodherberg's Contagion mates with Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, with an added dose of serious crack for good measure. An unknown, fast-acting pathogen that affects humans has spawned a deadly horde of zombies that is quickly turning entire cities into vast fields of the undead. Gerry Lane, a retired United Nations field investigator is reluctantly pulled out of a quiet retirement to identify the source of the virus.Despite the clear attempt to lend an air of credibilty to the zombie genre, which has thus far either been made strictly for fans of the genre or coupled with a comic element, World War Z can crumble under serious examination. It abandons coherence in space and time, takes umpteen liberties with its screenplay and has a singularly unmemorable cast, save for Brad Pitt, who himself looks a little haggard and battle-weary, and not strictly because he single-handedly takes on zombie armies either. Also, and there is no denying this, World War Z is the kind of predictable, done-to-death film that Hollywood is no stranger to.Still, if World War Z ends up being watchable enough, it is because of a few genuine thrills that the film manages to pack into its runtime, Ben Seresin's breakneck cinematography that manages to create a perceptible sense of atmosphere despite showing evident disdain towards lucidity in close-combat action scenes, and  some superbly-executed VFX. Also, even a tired-looking, underwhelming Brad Pitt has goods enough to pack a wallop with his effortless screen presence.Also, though this could possibly just be the softie in me, for the first time a zombie film had my heart reach out a little bit for the zombies themselves. In fact, considering how seriously the film takes itself, I personally felt it squandered an opportunity to show how zombie-like our own existences have become. After all, a purpose-less, materialistic life is hardly better than the un-life of a zombie; at least zombies have a purpose - infecting humans. Expectedly, the resolution of the film is as far-fetched as can be. And this is perhaps where Brad Pitt's persona helps the most; you need that kind of presence to overlook how truly incredulous the goings-on actually are. Apart from the last 20 minutes of the film, I really missed the kind of urgency he brought to his character in Babel or the sheer confident cockiness he displayed in Moneyball.The film is out in 2D as well as 3D, and again, the film would be far better experienced in 2D. The 3D darkens an already dark film, and doesn't really add much in terms of the 'third dimension' anyway. World War Z is really just a film for fans of rugged action and saving-the-world films, the kind of film that the audience should not take too seriously, even if the filmmakers themselves have done so.

If it’s the Greek mythology that intrigues you, however, I strongly suggest you rent Troy or even Disney’s Hercules. Basically, give this film a miss. ","I had an option of studying Greek Literature in college, and it all seemed so interesting with evil fathers, Oedipal sons and ostracized siblings – much like the plot of our television shows. I didn’t opt for it finally, but before watching this weeks’ Wrath of the Titans I thought I should read up a bit on Greek Mythology, so my movie watching experience could be devoid of questions. Wrong move. If you’re going to watch Wrath of the Titans (I strongly suggest you spend your money otherwise), please treat this as another action film with the heroes fighting monsters created out of the computer and nothing more. (Think Clash of the titans, John Carter and suchlike) Sequel to 2010’s Clash of the Titans, Wrath of the Titans isn’t an intriguing celebration of Greek mythology laced with universal morals that are passed down for generations. Maybe I was being too wishful to believe so, but I was proven wrong with this watered down version of a mash between Transformers and Immortals. The film begins with demi-god, Persues (Sam Washington) and his humble life as a fisherman. He is visited by Zeus (played by Laim Neeson) who informs him that the gods are losing their Godliness to the Humans and a dangerous war is brewing. Together, Zeus, Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Posiedon (Danny Huston) had overthrown Persues’ evil father Kronos, but now they must strike a deal with him to regain power and remain immortal. While each brother is battling it out to gain autonomy, Persues’, being the hero (and yes, there is no built up to why he was chosen in the first place) must save the human-race. Wrath of the Titans lacks a sense of story and structure. For a sequel, it assumes the viewer has seen the previous film and is well-versed with the small nitty-gritty’s of every character’s history. It’s like expecting to remember your relatives’ middle names and how they are remotely related to you. Before you can clear your doubt, a monster pops up on the screen: between three-headed made-up animals and a puffed up man-buffulo, you’re expecting pretty much anything to pop up on screen as a “threat”. The CG team is the real winner here. There’s no energy in the story-telling. When you revisit an older era, where the culture, habits and look is starkly different, the representation is usually one of awe and passion. Passion to bring out a world that we have only read of in books and more importantly a passion to tell a story based in that world. Wrath of the Titans looked more like a videogame to me – with no enthusiasm in the performances (a waste of the talented Ralph Fiennes), confused sense of structure and an overkill of visual effects. I strongly recommend you miss this one.

They absorb you in how they do it with mind-games and special effects. And this is despite the loud background score and an anti-climatic end. Action film lovers will love it. Those who question the basic concept, can forget enjoying it, of course.","They are creating a world so imaginary, that they can do whatever they want with it. Yet, in the world they create, they stick to some laws, even if they've established those rules themselves. So, here they create mutants, deformed people, but their deformity only makes them more powerful and thus more scary. It's when they break their own rules or deviate from them, that they distract us from what they are trying to do or say. Whether it is the special effects, the moral dilemma, or the mirror they hold to us as a society. X-Men: First Class successfully avoids such digressions and has a gripping story to tell. My issues with the X-men series has mainly been (even X-Men and X-Men 2 and more so in The Last Stand and Wolverine) - this deviation. Mutant-powers being redefined as per convenience. Like say, all mutants suddenly developing an exaggerated sixth sense. The beauty of the concept was that what one mutant can do, the other cannot. It is annoying then, when Wolverine can start hearing/smelling/sensing stuff he cannot see, just because it moves the script along. The other complaint I have had is that the characters were too black and white. That and the lame one-liners - those were the two things that made me really skeptical about a FIFTH film in the series. Fortunately X-Men: First Class consumes you. There's so much going on in terms of mind games and special effects that you have already pardoned the absence of attempts to act. That and it has witty dialogue and some of the pauses are brilliant entertainment. So yes, you fear Shaw, you empathize with Magneto, you feel for Mystique and you wish Prof. X could give his head a rest from his finger. But that's more about the characters and how they've developed over the last decade for you. And has barely anything to do with the performances. Interestingly (assuming that you've seen the earlier films in the series), you know how the main characters in the film are going to end up. But, there's enough going on to make you wonder and wait for ""how"". As usual, the set-up is to display what our mutants are capable of and it is all building up to a humungous showdown. Given the cool things that our newly introduced mutants are capable, I felt a little letdown by the climax. As if some one ran out of $-power. Or rather the money was all consumed by the thumping, loud background music. Even so, it is nice to see Xavier, the sacrosanct, use his power to flirt. It is a welcome surprise to see Magneto's human side or Mystique's feminine one. Their dilemmas are only mutant. But their prejudices are human. The ""bad"" mutants are racists. The ""good"" mutants patronize humans in the evolutionary process, like we in real life want to keep tigers from going extinct.The sides they have to choose between mirror what real life is all about. The communist/capitalist divide or the fight between races or even religions. Yep, there is a token religious symbolism thrown in too. This is the kind of deviation that is unnecessary and makes the film that is going well look over-ambitious and even wannabe. But, the point is this - at the end of 2-odd hours, I came out a satisfied, thriller-action-junky customer. And this is despite wanting a little more in terms of super-power display. X-Men: First Class is just one of those places where the whole adds up to more than a sum of the parts.Warning: Some scenes were obviously censored (I saw it in Pune, India) - either beeped words or scenes cut out.

X-Men: Days of Future Past has a terrific plot, aided by a superb ensemble cast.","There was a time when it seemed like there were just too many X-Men films coming out. After the original trilogy, the fifth film in the franchise, X-Men: First Class, featured an all-new cast, as it narrated the origin stories of Professor X and Magneto. The film, luckily, breathed some life into the franchise.The seventh film now, (two Wolverine films also appeared along the way,) X-Men: Days of Future Past, brings the cast and characters of the original trilogy as well as those from First Class in a terrific way - with a hooking plot that makes you invest in the X-Men like never before.In a dystopian future, the X-Men are being hunted and killed by machines known as Sentinels, for whom the X-Men are simply no match. Professor X and Magneto come up with an ingenious solution to the Sentinal menace.With the horde of Marvel films coming out lately, it is becoming increasing difficult to make each film stand out. The last of them, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, was a fun film, albeit one that still had too basic a plot. In fact, it is in the stories that films can either stand out or pale away; nothing separates them in terms of scale and execution.With original director Bryan Singer coming back at the helm, Days of Future Past has the thrills and bangs alright, but it is really all about the plot. The time travel aspect, the urgency in the characters' actions, the ambiguity in the motives of characters appearing both in the past and the present - all of it keeps you engaged all along. Even though the film seems to borrow so much from so many films in the recent past - for example, there are more than a few Matrix and Inception déjà vu moments sprinkled through the film - the fact remains that set in this X-Men universe with its unique set of characters, it works well. The ensemble cast works even better, because now there are just so many of them. Hugh Jackman has made Wolverine his own, and he's terrific. And there's great joy to be had with the thought of Michael Fassbender and Sir Ian McKellen portraying past and future versions of each other in the same film. Ditto for James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart. Jennifer Lawrence, expectedly in much better shape than in First Class, gets a meaty part and makes it count.One slight disappointment was that there isn't much that stands out in the jaw-dropping set piece department, only because we've seen so much of this already. But do watch out for one incredibly clever scene involving the lightning-fast reflexes of Peter Maximoff (or Quicksilver). With the final tiny post-credits scene, the stage is now set for 2016's X-Men: Apocalypse. Days of Future Past has set the tone for the future nicely.

","X: Past is Past – the name and the fact that 11 directors took a go at one story together – is enough to warn you that it is not going to be your normal Hindi/Indian film. Or if you are me, it is enough to get you excited despite the niggle, “too many cooks...” However, X: Past is Present, pleasantly surprises. The most pleasant one being that it does not get tempted by the many opportunities to go overboard, with the abstract. It stays focused on its protagonist's introspection.Sure, you could think of K (Rajat Kapoor) as a commitment-phobic, escapist. He says so himself. It is rubbed into his face and yours by each of his ex-girlfriends (or should we say X-girlfriends?)  But, it is more about not learning much from the past. This is not about a middle-aged man coming of age, quite literally overnight. He might change after where the film left us, but you wouldn't be surprised if he went through X-XI more relationships that took the same trajectory. After all, if the person falling in love is the same, can who he falls in love with change his perspective, until he really wants to?Until then, relationships will seem to carry a standard pattern. Which is why X: Past is Present feels repetitive and superficial at times. There are other times when it does give some insight, but then the moment/revelation is spoilt by spoon-feeding. Similarly, the camera angles do get a little annoying. At first, it looks like an attempt to be “cool/different”  and then it gets a tad annoying. You feel like saying, “I get it, K is confused and you need handheld camera work to show me his internal turmoil. Got the point, please hold camera steady now.”Even so, the consistency with which K's point of view is presented is something that got me interested in him. Even though I didn't get to know too much about the women, I found myself falling for K. The mystery that he is, the saving that he doesn't know he needs, appeals to the woman in me. And that is where X: Past is Present speaks subtly about how men and women approach relationships. However, that sweeping generalization is not the focal point of the film. K does not represent all men. X: Past Is Present is the story of one man who has gone through many relationships and hasn't figured out what he wants yet. About a man who lets his past relationships come in the way of his present ones. About a man who is looking for closure and maybe has to go all the way back to the beginning to find it – possibly the point where he became K. If the film weren't directed by 11 directors and written by even more people, it would come across as autobiographical. This is as much a compliment to the directors as it is to the editor. Dissecting the film director-wise or story-wise would be grave injustice to how smoothly it has all fallen in place. Jerky editing and back and forth in timeline usually get irritating if done without purpose. Here though, the non-linearity follows K's very human flickering thoughts. The editing adds to the ambience of being in someone's mind. K switches from one thread in memory to another, following his mind's own concept of connect and fluidity. However, when you do piece it together, it might not be a very interesting story. This is where the “how” wins over the “what”. Sensuousness is one of the constant tools through the film. There isn't explicit sex shown on screen, except once. And that once, it is not sexy at all. Yet, there is a palpable sexual tension irrespective of which woman is on screen. The women characters, themselves might almost seem like clones of each other – maybe because the man in question gets attracted to a certain kind of woman. Most of the actresses were very functional and looked uncomfortable in their bits. However, you can always trust Huma Qureshi, Radhika Apte and Swara Bhaskar to sizzle on screen and make even the most ordinary characters stand out. Aditi Chengappa does her bit to create intrigue, but that can be attributed more to the ambiguity of her character rather than her performance. Whether or not any of these were important in the film, X: Past Is Present attempts to underline how the extra X needed in a man's life. Should the focus then have been so much on the physical attraction? Taking the overarching theme of lust as a given, despite a couple of predictable moments, the film keeps you curious, which is not what you can say of many Indian films today. There is a mention of inanimate objects becoming a mode of communication between two people in a relationship. When it came up, I hoped that the theme would be expanded on a little more. The motifs stayed - watches, cigarettes, cups, etc but the theme didn't come back. Oh well, that would make for another film. And this once, maybe the directors can tell the reviewer, “you want a movie like that, you make it!”

","When you walk into a film called ""The Xposé"" and you know the word will stand for both skin-show and a big reveal equally, you aren't really walking in with too many expectations. I actually look forward to a line or two that will entertain/engage or at the very least amuse me. No such luck.Oh wait, Himesh Reshammiya's character Ravi is so obnoxious that it is amusing, till he gets annoying. But, till then, I was in awe of the person who thought of such an arrogant style for the protagonist. So, I am not rooting for the character, who is supposedly mean for the good. I don't care who he falls in love with and what he is willing to do for her. Considering it is a murder mystery, you'd think you are made to care about the victim. But, you are asked, neigh begged, to judge her negatively from the first frame she shows up in. And when the big ""expose"" happens, you don't care either. Sure, the writer has tried hard to make it a huge reveal, but it just doesn't matter enough. In addition, it goes overboard in increasing the tension. Yes, additional drama in terms of slo-mo scenes and dramatic background score. But, also story-wise it goes says more than once, ""not over yet, there's more.""The performances are as perfunctory as they can get. To rub salt into the wound, you have Irrfan Khan doing a voiceover. The setting of the 70s doesn't work at all. The songs, well has either, Yo Yo Honey Singh or Himesh Reshammiya as their singer. So, there's no looking for respite there. The sliver lining is - it is a short film. And that it has come out on a day where people are generally, likely to care about it even less than usual - let alone read its review.

Its ups, downs and in-betweens are handled with care, sensitivity and yet shows the filth that needs to be cleaned up to make this a better place to live in. Despite this it remains a be-as-it-may, this is home and I love it. ","Capitalism vs. communism, Dalit vs. Brahmins, Rich vs. poor, man vs. woman, North vs. South, fatalism vs. cynicism vs. self-believer, good vs. evil vs. not-so-good - and but ofcourse, Hinduism vs Islam vs. secularism. Yeh Mera India deals with all these concepts and more in its 130 minute run and does it fairly too. It employs some twenty odd characters and twines their lives together to make a believable albeit idealist picture of one city in this country. It’s a very enjoyable collage of characters that make up Indian urban life - from the middle-aged woman watching repeats of soap operas, to young career-minded woman aspiring to get away from Indian way of life. The creepy, cheesy bastard to the activist who wants a change in the establishment and soon. Among all the contradictions you see the irony when a doctor becomes the creator of death and when a judge is asked to bribe, or asked to go to court. While presenting this set of more-or-less realistic characters, Ye Mera India (YMI) has in its milieu - education, unemployment, underworld, judiciary, the naxalite movement, impact of jihad training on little minds, the bane of being a good-looking woman, TV TRP's dominating art - a comment on both the industry and the taste of what the audience wants. A setting where a person might not have money but he sure does have a mobile. A city that ain't for the simpletons. A city which supposedly thrives on lack of civic sense - from spitting on public property to lane cutting to road rage. The travel of farm-owner to becoming a suspect for robbery and faces assassination of her character. And in its midst comparing communism to religion. Sure, some of the attitudes on display might be exaggerated - both good and bad. And there's a phase where the sorry gets exasperatingly sorrier. And the usual transitions in characters that are just too good to be true. Then, there's the preacher-teacher going around showing everyone THE right path. While it works at times, it happens too often and unfortunately becomes unintentionally funny. Also the climax is a bit too difficult to digest and takes a lot away from the beauty of the film thus far. And yet it succeeds in making a point. As the mirror is held to various characters, the part of the audience that behaves like the character, sees its image on screen. Also when the intended-to-be-disgusting disgusts, you know all departments have worked completely and in sync. This is accompanies throughout with smart dialogues. And despite the extensive use of abusive language, it adds to the ambience rather and doesn't one look out-of-place. The narrator in the form of a voiceover recites insightful poetry. Though it might be a tad overdone in the first half.  None of this would have worked had it not been for the wonderful choice of cast. And that almost each one of them stood up to their task. And we are reminded that Rajpal Yadav can give a subtle performance if he's allowed to. A pleasant surprise, a decent eye-opener to the subtler hypocrisy in society Yeh Mera India should certainly be on your ""too watch"" list. If not the theaters, at the very least when its out on DVD.

This film makes no effort at subtlety. The drama, humour and action - all revolve around sexuality. None of it however seems forced and just when you begin to wonder what was the point of it all, the twist towards the end of the film save the day with a story around the ‘such is life’ theme.  Winner of Best Original Screenplay at the Venice Festival, this film also won similar nominations at the Golden Globes and Academy Awards. Either watch it alone, or with a cinematically mature bunch of people. Make sure your parents are at bay!","Y Tu Mama Tambien (And Your Mother Too) is a Spanish phrase, often used in response to a cuss word hurled at you. The film will never release in India and even if it does release on DVD, significant portions of the film will get the censors’ axe. (I rented the International edition...geez!). I wouldn’t call it soft porn - it’s in fact one notch higher. That said, I must say, its a good film, with some big names in world cinema attached to it. Directed by Alfonso Cuaron (he made Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and produced Pan’s Labyrinth), this film stars one of my favourite Spanish actors Gael Garcia Bernal (The Motorcycle Diaries, Amores Perros, Babel), along with Maribel Verdu (Milk) and Ana Lopez Mercado (Pan’s Labyrinth).Bernal (Julio) and Verdu (Tenoch) play very close teenage buddies, who at a wedding, court Ana (Luisa) and casually propose a road-trip to a beach, hoping she would bite the bait. When Luisa really does, the trio embark on a journey that makes them discover new shades not only about each other’s pasts, but about life in general.The film’s genre, a road trip, lends itself to easy viewing - thanks to humour, scenic locales, picturesque, agile photography. The purpose of the trip and the key take-away from it, is what takes this film a notch higher. Due credit for that goes to Cuaron’s screenplay. The interplay of the dialogues and the narrator’s voice-over mix very well and provide a longer shelf-life to the characters.I frankly thought there’s too much sex in the film and after a point all that the three are discussing is sex, how they do it, who they did it with and how it was. Sure, there’s a purpose to all those talks and although not all of it is titillating, I’m a huge supporter of subtlety and I’d prefer that a film-maker use semiotics and his own creativity to interpret such sexual energy.  Cuaron’s style is more like, ‘This is how it happened. I don’t want to hide anything’.One of the strong points of the film, is the manner in which Cuaron depicts life outside their car. An accident on the highway, a bride’s family asking for alms, political unrest, regular police patrolling, a beggar entering a restaurant to ask for alms - each of them are beautiful reminders that although the trio may be on a dream road trip, but eventually, they will have to return to the big, bad ugly world. Shades of that ugly world - the character’s histories, some cloaked in lies, appear intermittently throughout the film, resulting in tears, agony and arguments. Each of them are fantastic allegories of bumps on the highway. You slow down for a moment, but eventually you move on.I loved every actor’s performance in the film. Both Bernal and Verdu are intense, jovial and brooding. They’ve done their nude scenes with enormous confidence and their camaraderie shows. Ana is graceful, bold and mysterious and the one force that keeps the three together. Her character, as you learn by the end of the film, is the only thing that saves the film from becoming just a film about a journey.Watch this film with a mature bunch of people - those who appreciate cinema and do not start giggling or gasping at bold love making scenes.

Not in a good way. ,"For a person who watches at least two films a week in the theaters, including some really bad ones, I admit  it is difficult for films to get me hooked. But, hand-in-hand, it is equally difficult to keep me more than 100% detached from what's going on on screen. Even when my expectations are low, I am on the watch for something to like, something to enjoy. But Yaariyan, manages to even take that away from me. The screenplay is all over the place here. The only clarity it seems to have is that it knows not what to do with itself. It is almost like they used a trial and error method of sticking blocks of story together. That is especially sad considering the individual blocks of story are rather random in the first place. Picture this - Four pretty much good-for-nothing kids in college are picked up to defend the honor the college. Why? While you have given up on finding an answer to that, the principal of the college insists on giving reasons which might as well have not been given. So, they have to compete with some college school in Australia and jingoism follows. The competition continues to be pointless and the worst bit is absolutely disgusting sub-plots lengthen the runtime of the film.If I go about looking for a needle in the hay stack, I would say the only Rakul Preet came across as someone who might be a good actor if given a chance. She's sweet and has a fresh spontaneity about her that I'd like to see more of. And I say this with Deepti Naval and Gulshan Grover in the cast. Then you have a couple of songs the lyrics of which strike a chord, but why would you suffer a film for lyrics?Very rarely, do I say this about a film, but this once I have to - there go two and a half hours of my life. Especially considering the Pune International Film Festival is on. Sigh

Over-the-top, no-head-nor-tail, senselessness served in the name of unpretentious cinema. Sure, many from the crowd around me were laughing, hooting, and whistling their hearts out. At what though, is beyond me.No thanks, I'm very comfortable with my sense of humor. ","No one, (yes, including me), walks in to watch Yamla Pagla Deewana expecting an intense experience or a strong story line. Everyone is in there to have a good laugh, come out, and laugh that they laughed. And a scene or two that stick in the head, even after you are out, is a bonus. Even with my expectations being what they should be, I found very few funny or entertaining bits. I'm talking of earthen pots pausing in mid-air in pseudo-Matrix fashion. Only to be lamely put away by Sunny Deol's ""dhai kilo ka haath.""  Creativity, element of surprise is not for this filmmaker. The actors, well, they do whatever Sunny Deol, Bobby Deol and (today's) Dharmendra can do. I was worried I wouldn't be able to hear the dialogue in the middle of all the hooting. But it wasn't a concern at all. The trio is louder beyond that. After all, it is supposedly a prerequisite for the genre. Kulraj Randhwa's role exists so there is some sort of coherence to the planned chaos that the film is. As usual, I was disheartened to see Anupam Kher do a role which demeans his talent.The blatant disregard for the 'writing' department is so obvious that I cannot really complain about how the character establishment of Dharmendra and Bobby Deol as conmen had absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film. And there are many such glaring disconnects. In between this mayhem, it was only a pleasure to listen to a few witty lines strewn across that brought that occasional smile. But that is way too little for a film that is just short of 3 hours.Presenting nonsense is an art form. Watching the entire Deol family dance in one frame is not my idea of entertaining nonsense. Other than that, the action sequences and the stylization - the two other reasons why one would consider watching this film - are as lame as they could be. The interesting thing though is that whether you think the film is going to be - hardcore silly entertainment that you love or brainless torture of the senses - your expectations will be fulfilled.

The one that they are worse than the first in the series. Well, we know what the verdict on Yamla Pagla Deewana was. All we can say is Yamla Pagla Deewana 2 stays true to the genre, ""sequels"".Okay maybe, the plot is a little more coherent that that of Yamla Pagla Deewana. But, that comparison is pretty much pointless considering Yamla Pagla Deewana didn't have a plot at all. The performances are the same brand of loud and over-the-top, good enough to once again make the actors look like fools prancing around. Once again, heart goes out for Anupam Kher and this time even Annu Kapoor who are reduced to doing such roles. Interestingly, Sunny Deol is the one who gives it his all and tries to pull the film along.As far as the action and comedy go, I have no clue who the action would excite and who would laugh at the jokes or get excited. There is always that element of laughing at, ""so silly that you cannot but laugh"" in films of this type. Fortunately or unfortunately, Yamla Pagla Deewana 2 has that element, but it wanes in about two and a half minutes. While watching the film, the only thing I was cringing at was the thought that there might be a Yamla Pagla Deewana 3. There is a Yamla Pagla Deewana 2, right? What is going to stop a third one from coming along? shudder

Soon enough though, it contradicts itself and becomes a predictable story. ","The only novelty in Yeh Khula Aasmaan is the grandfather-grandson relationship. The rest is a mix of inspiring 'quotable quotes' that are worth what they are worth and the typical underdog sports story. Behind all the emphasis on not pressurizing a child to score academically is a thick layer of pressure to succeed in whatever it is chosen for him. And that didn't at all work for me. However, if there is one take away from Yeh Khula Aasman it is the brilliant performance of Raghuvir Yadav.Whether or not I agree with what Raghuvir Yadav's character had to do, his performance is warm and endearing. So is debutant Raj Tondon's performance - he comes across as the perfect representative of the confused, diffident, complex age called adolescence. The rest of the cast is actually functional and thus caricaturish. Only these two seem to have real emotions. In that sense then, real emotion is what the relationship is about. That I found it far from ideal is a different matter. While Ye Khula Aasmaan looks down upon parents tendency to put their children down as a way to bring a sense of responsibility, it adds the burden of bearing a grandparent's aspirations. This then boils down to a child having to live up to someone or the others' expectations. What good will that do? 
So, what if a simple medium of a kite-fight is used signify this larger thing called life. The metaphor is used beautifully in one song, but beyond that it becomes a bit much and all I could see was the need for Avinash (Raj Tondon) to succeed. 
This brings me to the question, what happens to people who don't succeed? There are people who haven't ever succeeded in anything they did. What happens to them? Or it just might be that there is no story worth making a film out of in there. There are indeed very few 'loser' protagonists who have succeeded as a story in a film. 
I won't say which route Yeh Khula Aasmaan takes, that one you'll figure out as the movie progresses. But, what I can tell you is that Yeh Khula Aasmaan is not a complete loss because of Raghuvir Yadav, Raj Tondon and the chemistry they create. The preachy dialogue worked just a bit because it was within a relationship between a grandfather and his grandson. You could see it fall apart as soon as Avinash's friends began saying lines meant to inspire. 
Yeh Khula Aasman has some lovely, warm, genuine moments of camaraderie between  grandparent and grandchild both because of hard work at writing and an heartfelt performances by the protagonists. Unfortunately, it beats its purpose by doing exactly what it pointed a figure at to start with.

The basic plot is whacky  - just like the individual tracks and the characters. Just as you get used to one sub-plot a new twist is waiting its turn, and yet it doesn't feel rushed. Magically, the events of the previous scene have registered. Surprisingly, at no point is there information overload, which could be an issue for films that go back and forth. Your comfort with the proceedings could well be because all non-linearity is only in terms of flashbacks and most of it is in context too. For example, a character goes into happy memories of the past to relieve himself of physical pain and so on. I thoroughly enjoyed the wit in the writing. It's not just clever dialogue - the overall story, the build-up, and the sequence in which the sub-plots come also have inbuilt humor. I might have enjoyed it better if I knew more about the characters, not in terms of backstory, but anything that made me feel for them - it'd have been nice to connect an emotion to a character. But then again, it's not required that I feel for anyone in a film that falls in this bracket - a dark comedy. I enjoyed their idiosyncrasies for what they are. A lot of it is of course, credited to Irrfan Khan. The man has just the perfect sense of timing that this kind of humor needs. Chitrangda Singh too is one of the reasons why you want to watch this film. There are a host of other characters and interesting actors playing them out, but none other than Arunoday Singh have enough screen time. Arunoday Singh though seemed very uncomfortable and a misfit in this gang of goons. And then there are irritants like voiceovers and animated airplanes. I don't enjoy voiceovers in general, but ones which educate you about 'life' have to be really profound to maintain the interest. Also, they have become such an integral part of Hindi films of this genre that the tone used is the same and so is the manner in which it is delivered. Another downer are the choppy edits, the kind I found disorienting in director, Sudhir Mishra's earlier film Khoya Khoya Chand. And this too I could have lived with, without complaining, because of the smart content. But the lame and unnecessary superimposed text showed that the director/writer seemed to have lost respect for his audience in post-production. Also the silly animation had no rhyme or rhythm. The intention must have been to make it comic, but the animation just didn't fit with the rest of the humor in the film. There are other decisions which made the film a richer experience. The camerawork made it a trippy experience. Though I don't understand why so many shots (day shots too) are almost completely dark. Did they take the genre too literally? But since there are so many scenes where the actors can barely be seen, it feels like the lighting decisions are made to hide their lack of skill. What counts though is that the film is enjoyable despite the dark ambience. What is remarkable is the performances aren't breathtaking, the characters don't connect but the general feeling of having watched a good film stays with you.

It’s a shame that the first hour and the court room scenes are very mediocre. Which is why the twists and turns post-interval come both as a pleasant surprise and make for one of the best climaxes I've seen in a long, long time.","Yeh Faasley's first hour is one of those in which you'd want to walk out of the theater. Like that of a badly made B-grade film. The excessively grainy texture doesn't add any fun either. It is way too distracting. But then, the actual plot starts unfolding and man is it a thrilling ride! It's not just the surprises; the psychological element that the story carries is one mind-bending process. In fact, it is one example of how even a straightforward, linear narrative can take a fair share of your brainpower. After leaving the theater, you go back and forth between why Dev (Anupam Kher) behaved the way he did. It also adds some insight into why Arunima (Tena Desae) who thinks her father killed her mother would still want to bond with her dad. Like anyone in love, she wants to hold on to the last thread of hope, which will keep her from hating her father she once loved. ""Why did he kill her? Is he the man she thinks he is? Was there no love at all between them? Did he kill her at all?"" These are the questions Arunima pulls you into, when you were half-ready to leave the theater. You didn't only because of your respect for Anupam Kher. And while he doesn't let you down, we know he could have done so much more with the scene in which he breaks down. Instead, there is a plain voiceover narrating the emotions. Such a shame. These are decisions for which the director has to take complete blame. Also, the courtroom drama ...actually can't be called drama because it is rather blah considering how smartly and subtly the psychological part of the plot is played out. The screenplay also doesn't support the story in terms of consistent pace. The set-up is boring and takes too much screen-time. The actual action starts much later and has very little time to play itself out. Yeh Faasley's story at its core is beyond awesome. I'd have loved to see what a different director and another screenplay writer would have done with it. Oh well, at least they didn't mess the way it turns out in the end. The psychological nuances and motivations explain everything.Off late, with any movie that I've started to like at any point, I dread the climax - it invariably is butchered by awful writing for the climax or commercial needs. Yeh Faasley is the other way round. The climax is just perfect!

Not nearly as charming or honest as Wake Up Sid, YJHD is the kind of film you wouldn’t mind watching despite the fact that there isn’t much in the film that is memorable. With a cast that will win your heart and music that’ll play on loop in your head for a while after, the film is fun but rarely much more.","*I am out on a vacation. Pradeep has been kind enough to review the film for wogma. So here goes...    ~ meetu* In 2009, a young 26-year old’s debut directorial film won hearts because of how fresh and real it seemed (by ‘commercial film’ standards, of course) especially considering that it came from Dharma, who’ve never truly been associated with anything ‘real’ as far as cinema is concerned. Wake Up Sid has since gone on to become a bit of a cult film; its male lead going on to achieve superstardom not just on the strength of his genes, but also because of some terrific performances that have only gotten better with every passing film.Naturally, expectations from Ayan Mukerji’s sophomore effort, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, were bound to pile up. I, for one, corrected my expectations after the first promo was out. It seemed that Mukerji decided to forsake some of the freshness and realism from Wake Up Sid in favour of a bit more, if I may say it, ‘masala’. That initial bit of correction helped me immensely, because my instinct about the film turned out to be quite close to how the film is.Stuck in limbo between the realism (or as much of it one can spike into a ‘commercial’ film) and the usual larger-than-life-ness one usually associates with Karan Johar (think Student Of The Year), Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (YJHD) is an easy, fun-enough watch for the most, largely due to its continuously vibrant feel, a highly competent lead and supporting cast, and its music, which straddles peppiness and flavor with ease. Episodic in nature, YJHD introduces us to Naina, a young medical student who is in a state of flux because she feels she just doesn’t get to have enough fun. A chance encounter with an old school friend makes Naina cross paths with Kabir Thapar, or Bunny, as he is known by his friends. Despite being poles apart, their attraction to each other has ramifications in both their lives, not to mention the lives of their friends Avi (Aditya Roy Kapur) and Aditi (Kalki Koechlin). What surprised me about the film is how it is as much about friendships and relationships that go beyond romance, as it is about the romance between its (quite enchanting) lead pair. Quite like Wake Up Side which had the flavor of romance but was essentially a coming-of-age film, this film too has romance as one of its pillars, but not the only one. It also is a story of strong bonds of friendship that transcend time and space, about the compromises that one has to make in order to make any relationship work, romantic or otherwise. Not surprisingly, it is also, yet again, a coming-of-age tale, something that seems to be a pet subject for Ayan Mukerji. Expectedly, YJHD falters more than once. Every time the film pauses for a moment of genuine, real insight embellished by some cheesy-but-breezy dialogue (penned by Hussain Dalal), you see a spark of what was seen in Wake Up Side. Soon after, though, the film goes back to farfetched situations that would have seemed more at home in a typical film helmed by, say, Karan Johar. This continuous oscillation between the insightful and the ‘filmy’ takes its toll on the film more than one would have liked. Another area where the film really should have been worked on more was in the treatment of the characters. Despite wearing their chalk-and-cheese character sketches on their sleeves, Naina and Bunny in particular often act or react completely out of character. So, while their overall trajectory is always clear to you, their behaviour and traits will often make you wonder why exactly they are like that, when they are actually not supposed to be like that.Despite some rather serious issues in the writing, then, what really makes the film race to the finish line are the performances. Starting from Farookh Sheikh and Tanvi Azmi who barely have a couple of scenes, all the way up to Ranbir Kapoor who expectedly dominates proceedings in terms of screen time, every single actor is worth their weight in gold, as far as this particular film is concerned. The surprise packages are Kalki Koechlin, Aditya Roy Kapur and Deepika Padukone, who infuse such genuine charm, likeability, believability and credibility into their characters that you can’t help but really love them. Ranbir’s performance needs to be considered in context. After two diametrically opposite yet equally intense performances, one could be fooled into thinking that Ranbir could easily ace this character and that he deserves more challenging roles. Yes, YJHD doesn’t challenge him like some of his earlier films, but that doesn’t mean that he doesn’t invest his all into it. Here is someone who gives every character everything he has, and Ranbir gives Bunny the life that he deserves. Also, one can’t but help notice the terrific chemistry of the Ranbir – Deepika pair. They look like they are meant to be together on screen, and the optimist in me believes that they have the potential to become the SRK – Kajol of their generation.Despite some highly contrived song situations, the music of the film, by Pritam, holds its own. Every song is a bit of an audio-visual treat; even the one with Madhuri Dixit in it, despite the terribly underwhelming situation it arrives in. Overall, the songs do play a major role in keeping things going. Badtameez Dil and Balam Pichkari are terrific because of Ranbir and Deepika respectively, while Kabira and Ilahi add soul and texture to the soundtrack.With a run time of 2 hours and 45 minutes and the fact that the film doesn’t really have anything new to say, the film isn’t likely to be universally loved. Still, it is the kind of film you wouldn’t attempt to find too much fault with, because of how it stays clear of getting annoying or overly predictable, even if you largely know which direction you are being led to. Not a particularly bad way to spend a few hours of your life, though I’d take Wake Up Sid over YJHD any day of the week, and twice on a Friday.

Youngistaan claims to represent the youth and I shudder at the thought of the youth - you and I - being so shallow and superficial in our approach to problems at the national level. What do I want from my representative in the government? Only my lookout? Only whether my point of view has been represented? I don't think so. I want what is generally good for the society as a whole. But, Youngistaan has created a Prime Minister who thinks his way is the way to go. I consider myself pretty liberal so, I don't really care about my Prime Minister's girlfriend problems or daddy issues. Everyone has them, he is human, he is allowed to have them too. Am I okay with him having a live-in relationship? Now, my liberalism is being put to test. I am okay with friends, but a role model. Hey, wait! In a film about the future of the country, why am I even asking this question? Fine, Youngistaan doesn't talk about just this issue. From the huge ocean of politics the two and a quarter topics they pick are change in calculation of rate of interest on loans for a particular range of people, a scam of some sort, and a quarter of a nod at farmer suicides. The accountant in me couldn't resist laughing at the implications of the interest rate change that our PM Abhimanyu Kaul (Jackky Bhagnani). The build up of the scam led to something so standard (I know, it's sad that there is something like a standard scam) that you wonder what the big issue was. The look of surprise when it is mentioned to our PM that agriculture is our main sector, is actually insulting. His superficial solution, makes you feel worse. Then you consider for a moment if Youngistaan is a story of a 28 year old boy who is emotionally blackmailed into becoming the prime minister of the country. But it doesn't work that way either. It loses that battle at its name itself, right? It wants to represent the youth. It is not an individual's story yet it spends too much time on the love life of that individual while trying to deal with national crises via some jingoism, of course. A storyline with such a premise would be a difficult sell even with the best actors at your disposal. Jackky Bhagnani does come across as sincere. But there is so little time spent on writing a character that is so important, that like I said, I doubt any other actor could've helped. Same goes for Neha Sharma who's supposedly the supportive girlfriend. Again, such a wonderful chance of writing a layered character wasted. A similar waste of talent is Farouque Shaikh. May his soul rest in peace.Sure, there is an attempt at trying something new. It feel flat on its face, but at least they tried. Oh well.

But then all this while the eyes were witnessing a Sanjay Leela Bhansali set-up. So, a Hindi film enthusiast should be all set to get dazed and dazzled. The advantage to this though is that in contrast the story and characters are as simple as can be.You know what simple means, right? Black and white. And eventually black turns white. Sure there are a couple characters like the lawyer (Mithun Chakravorty) and the maternal uncle (Anjan Srivastav) that make you wonder if they are black or white for a bit. But then you lose interest. The writers clearly want me to take sides, but don't give me enough details to be bothered.Neither can I be made to really care about the main characters. 2 out of the 4 (Salman Khan and Zayed Khan) are losers - and sore ones at that. One is eye candy trying out her emoting skills - that would obviously be Katrina Kaif. That lady is certainly at her elegant best, though.  And the only one who was worth watching, for his supposedly autistic behavior, Anil Kapoor has very little screen time.Now, a simple wiki search tells you that autism is ""is characterized by impaired social interaction and communication"". But our man is social enough to lecture his beloved uncle on family values. And he has befriended children and adults who have bothered to interact with him. Not to mention he has grown appropriately in his flirting capabilities. Ok, we shall not hold story-writers responsible for the big words they off-handishly throw our way. Please, can we have them write a decent, engrossing story? The Archie-Veronica angle and her rich dad spouting exaggerated insults at him is yawnnnn. It's a musical extravaganza madam, you expect the wrong things all the time.Now that is one thing Yuvvraaj cannot be accused of - lacking in the song and dance department. I actually enjoyed listening to the songs, barring ""aaja main hawaon mein"". And for being distracted during that one, I can actually blame the phobia I have for animated petals after Drona. The way the other songs were picturised did have a broadway musical feel to them,  and this was ratified by an all out replication of the makeup from the CATS musical. BUT, stick to that. Please don't have Salman Khan talk to Beethoven. Anyway, we could have done with a lot less of familial blah-blah. That would also help in reducing the length that is stretched to almost 3 hours.

I'd think it's because the makers felt there was some great value addition they thought they could make which the original badly needed. Other than the fact, of course, that they didn't have anything original to make. But, I refuse to believe that the makers of this remake of Zanjeer didn't know they were taking away from an already not-so-great film. Are they so smug to not realise that a two-expression Ram Charan taking the place of Amitabh Bachchan is many huge steps behind to start of with? Are they so blind to not see the disservice to films from the 70s by having a over-bearingly peppy, supposedly dumb Mala (Priyanka Chopra) replace a simple and sensitive Mala (Jaya Bachchan)? The original had this nice combination of angst and sensitivity between Vijay and Mala. It wasn't explored too well there too, but here it is completely ignored. This takes away a huge chunk of the meat that the plot had. I guess the only positive contribution by this Zanjeer is that the woman gets invited to the birthday party! You see, Mala was left out of Sher Khan's birthday party in 1973. Come 2013, she gets to look pretty in white and shake a leg too!Priyanka Chopra, like I mentioned earlier, plays a very perky Mala. We can't really fault her if the script used her like comic relief. That besides, Ram Charan tries too hard to look intense and Sanjay Dutt looks like he was forced to play Sher Khan. There is a slur in his movements in the fight scenes and in his speech when he speaks. A couple of other things make things even worse - the dialogue and the music. You don't know what is worse - the iconic original lines that are retained or the new lame lines. A few more moments of disbelief - how could they not know that 'jab tak baithne ki ijaazat...' by anyone but Amitabh Bachchan or 'Sher Khan beimaani ka kaam bhi...' by anyone but Pran is epic fail? The songs are more or less annoying. My take on item number is no secret. Not only are they aesthetically displeasing and condescending to me as an audience, but the manner in which they break the flow of the story is the most irritating bit of them all. Here you have two songs that can fit that bill. Zanjeer also has a ridiculous background score. At first when, 'raghupati raghav...' played during a fight sequence, I wondered if the projectionist goofed up and turned on Satyagraha's soundtrack. Unfortunately, not. And the background track repeated almost every time Vijay has a fight sequence. Oh well...I understand that even if you had nothing better to do, you'd be better off watching the Zanjeer from 1973, this one cannot be completely written off - maybe just because I have seen worse, and await much worse.

658,1358,1358,1358,1358,Zapatlela 2,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/zapatlela-3d-review/,,,,1.6,"Mahesh Kothare returns with Zapatlela 2 in 3D, proudly wearing the tag of being the first Marathi film in 3D. If you enjoyed the original film, then you might just have fun with this sequel. The terrifying Tatya Vinchu is still fun, and even though Lakshya is absent this time round, Adinath Kothare fills his boots surprisingly well. If silly, scary dolls are your thing, submit yourself to Tatya’s menace!","So that’s how it feels. A screen playing a Marathi film packed to capacity, an audience hooting and cheering in the first show on the day of release. Twenty years after Tatya Vinchu terrified Lakshya (and the audience) with the sheer audacity of his existence, he’s back, this time with the third dimension in tow. Despite being an unabashed fan of the original film, I reminded myself that I was only about 8 when I watched it first. I walked in to the theatre this time, with my palm at the ready, not too far from my face. Yes, I must confess, I was expecting to ‘facepalm’.For the uninitiated, twenty years back, dreaded gangster Tatya Vinchu, in his quest for immortality, transferred his soul into a doll in his dying moments with the help of a spell taught to him by Baba Chamatkar. The doll, owned by ventriloquist Lakshmikant alias Lakshya, wreaks havoc before it is ultimately shot down by Inspector Mahesh Jadhav. Sounds ridiculous? Well, if you had watched the film when it came out, you’d know just how much fun the film was, despite the corn-and-cheese.Surprisingly, despite predictable buffoonery, continuous madcap comic horror (if there is such a thing) and the absence of the late Lakshmikant Berde – one half of the soul of the earlier film (pun unintended) - Zapatlela 2 makes for a fun children’s film, especially if the audience were children when the original film came out. Yes, it is a silly film that rarely pretends to be anything but. However, sometimes, just sometimes, the hackneyed phrase, ‘leave your brains at home’, genuinely comes in handy.My palm and my face, then, rarely met during the film, and when they did, it was out of some genuine indulgent fun. This time round, Tatya Vinchu is hunting for Lakshmikant’s son Aditya, who has grown up to become a mechanical engineer, but in his heart of hearts wants to be a ventriloquist like his father. Aditya, of course, is blissfully unaware of the events of twenty years ago. Really, I cannot emphasize how much your reaction to this film depends on whether you were a fan of the original film or not. That ragtag doll voiced by the legendary Dilip Prabhavalkar took on a personality of its own, engraving itself in memory. The doll looks freakishly the same, and that moronic expression on its face still has the ability to strike comedy-tinged terror in your heart.Zapatlela 2 works to an extent, in spite of having virtually no plot and a number of pointless subplots revolving around the ventriloquist, his guard, a lady journalist and a romantic track involving Aditya; it works because of its relentless physical comedy. Also, Adinath Kothare, son of director Mahesh Kothare, does a fine job as Aditya. Mahesh Kothare himself reprises his role as Mahesh Jadhav, now Commissioner, and he does it well. Again, the cherry-on-top is the menacing return of the doll, voiced by Dilip Prabhavalkar. He’s still angry and bloodthirsty, and he’s still capable of taking on full-grown men with ease. The doll animation is marginally better this time, but even if it wasn’t, that would be the least of your concerns with this film. Also, I was quite surprised to notice that the makers haven’t compromised on technique here. The film is fairly well-executed, in the manner in which it is shot and cut.  And if you’re going to enjoy ludicrousness, then you may as well enjoy the shameless exploitation of the third dimension. Objects are thrust and thrown at you with alarming frequency, and I could hear children in the cinema hall particularly enjoying the experience. Let’s be clear; Zapatlela 2 is for fanboys and fangirls, and for their children, who are bound to have a good time. Take them along for a ride that Tatya Vinchu won’t let them forget. If you don’t fall in that category, then you’ve always got a palm and a face.

659,1359,1359,1359,1359,Zero Dark Thirty,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/zero-dark-thirty-review/,,,,1.6,"Kathryn Bigelow is back post ‘The Hurt Locker’, and there couldn’t have been a better follow-up to that cult hit than Zero Dark Thirty. A dramatized account of the hunt for Osama Bin Laden, the film is immensely engaging without being unnecessarily dramatic, and more importantly, without ever transcending into jingoistic Americanism. Zero Dark Thirty is, quite simply, a thrilling and moving film.","It has been a while since I watched a film that I hoped would never end. Kathryn Bigelow’s Zero Dark Thirty, for me, was precisely that. A gripping cinematic adaptation of the long-drawn hunt for Osama Bin Laden in the wake of 9/11, I was amazed at how every second of the film held a sense of drama, even though the treatment of the film was far from dramatic.  Like most films based on real events, particularly those that are so fresh in memory, Zero Dark Thirty is the kind of film that almost anyone can paraphrase in a few sentences, knowing pretty much how the story proceeds, and definitely knowing how it ends, even if they haven’t watched the film. Yet, the film is so much more than just the story of how Bin Laden was found. For me, Zero Dark Thirty was partly a dramatization of a real life manhunt, partly a spy-thriller and mostly the intensely personal (and fictional) story of one persevering woman who makes it her life’s mission to find and kill the man who spearheaded the death of over 3000 of her countrymen.The film follows Maya, a CIA agent recruited straight from college and eventually stationed in Islamabad; she has done nothing at CIA but look for Osama Bin Laden. From an awkward, mute spectator of the torture of captured terrorists orchestrated by her colleague to a ruthless executor of those very same torture techniques (though never losing her conscience or her discomfort with them), Maya obstinately tries every trick in the book, and some outside it, in an attempt to smoke out America’s most wanted terrorist. Embellished with Alexandre Desplat’s minimalist but haunting background score, the film is technically top-notch. So much so that you’ll forgive some of the goofs; for example, the glimpse of the India Post signboard in a scene supposedly set in Pakistan (parts of the film were shot in Chandigarh). The camera that captures the action in Zero Dark Thirty is almost like another character in the film. It is always on the move, as nervous and fidgety as the characters themselves, almost as if it is as frustrated at the slow progress on tracking Bin Laden’s whereabouts as the head honchos at the CIA. And if the camera is a character, then the soul of that character is undoubtedly the editing of the film. Splicing together chapters of ‘the world’s largest manhunt’ across over a decade, across countries, hierarchies and departments while never losing that personal touch - the fact that it is humans hunting humans - the film has been creatively and technically edited to near-perfection. The final 20 minutes of the film are the icing on the cake. Post its US release, the film underwent its share of controversy. There is no doubt that the film’s much-talked about torture scenes are gruesome (but never disgusting or unwatchable). But to say that the film either glorifies torture or distorts the truth behind the extent of the torture is unfathomably ignorant. Maya’s reactions to the torture scenes and the manner in which she reacts even during and after she conducts some torture herself, quite amply illustrate the stand that Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal have taken, even though their approach to the film is remarkably close to neutral. For the second time in under a week, I watched Jessica Chastain anchor a film by achieving a remarkable graph in character that makes the viewer feel a personal stake in the character’s story. That being said, her performance in Zero Dark Thirty is miles ahead of her performance in Mama. It is hard to imagine anyone else recreate the character of a frail, petite woman with nerves that can make most men nervous; she does it with various male characters in the film and you will never have trouble believing it.Joel Edgerton wasn’t required for the role he plays, that of the leader of the SEAL team on Operation Neptune Spear. Having said that, the calming, reassuring effect of his sheer presence is hard to deny. A number of other supporting characters leave their mark; Jason Clarke as the man who initiates Maya into the interrogation process is excellent, as is Kyle Chandler, who plays the Islamabad station chief and Maya’s boss. The film is never infused with any additional drama; the actual unfolding of the events does that by itself. As I mentioned earlier, so riveting is the narrative that I never wanted the film to end. At nearly two and three quarters of an hour, I didn’t find the film too long at all, though I suspect there will be those that will. Still, whether you are interested in the procedural aspect of the hunt for Bin Laden or the dramatized portrayal of it, Zero Dark Thirty is a film that must be watched.

But it's too long and long-windedly preachy to hold interest through the end.,"Bhagyashree carries over from Maine Pyaar Kiya to show what post-marital life would be with a simple and virtuous woman like her. Simple she may be but succumbing her character, Asmita is not. She knows her mind and will not compromise or take any crap thrown her way. Asmita, however impractical is the only beauty of this film. The rest is a lot of ho-hum and a very poor attempt at comedy. I have often wondered why a person offends in public and apologizes, if at all, in private. The basic plot of this film makes sure that the wrong-doer is appropriately humiliated in public. And that if the offended is strong in conviction they will get their way. Yet, it takes an exasperatingly long time to get there it also has loads of eye-roll inducing dialogues served along the way. Surprisingly though, there's a certain flow in the script that is lacking in many Hindi and Marathi films these days. It doesn't come across as one episode was edited to be pasted after another randomly. One event led smoothly into another. That still doesn't mean that characters are consistent or transform smoothly or are written well. And the interactions between people seem extremely superficial. There's this constant feeling of being in the late 80s-early 90s. From the way the people are dressed to their body language to the way the songs are picturised. That also means that Bhagyashree looks absolutely sweet and the other side characters absolutely obnoxious. I can't deny that it's very adorable to see a bride actually feel shy on her wedding day. If nothing else it's nostalgic for sure. But, we'd much rather watch one of the films for 90s for that, wouldn't we? Also, some out of all the really long songs are absolutely hideous. And song or no song, there's absolutely nothing natural about any of the performances - as 'put-on' as they can get. If you have the patience to sit through or forward some long speeches on values, some distasteful songs, some yawn-worthy comedy there is a pretty impractical yet novel argument in the end. But that patience will be required in abundance.

Mostly silly, sometimes endearing but always pointless, it is the kind of film that will make you smile by the sheer sincerity in its stupidity. Give me Zhakaas over  Players any day.","Ankush Choudhary is clearly a man in love with himself. In addition to being the lead actor of Zhakaas, he has also directed the film. So he gets to walk multiple times in slow motion towards the camera (Ray Bans in tow), leap to super human heights and stay there long enough to wink at the audience, and in general make himself feel slightly more important than he actually is. Last seen in the disastrous Pratibimb, he has the aura of someone that you really cannot take too seriously.Perhaps that has helped Zhakaas in some measure, because inane as it is, I still came away feeling mildly amused. The prime reason for this is the fact that the film really doesn’t take itself too seriously. It promises entertainment and if the reaction of my co-audience in the theatre is anything to go by, it manages to deliver that in some measure.The plot itself is as ludicrous as can be. Right in the initial reels, it is revealed that Ankush’s character leads a triple life, with three different girls. A series of gags then go on to explain the Five Ws and One H of this situation. Needless to say, logic and anything that might appear close to it in a thesaurus take a backseat in this flick. The performances in this film add some measure of school-boyish charm to the ridiculous goings-on. Ankush himself is surprisingly endearing, because he invests himself completely into his part, or should I say, parts. Of the three girls, Sai Tamhankar as the spunky photographer Neha succeeds in sprinkling some believability into her part. She manages to emote well for the most, with the occasional tendency to go over the top. But then, in this film, who doesn’t? Pooja Sawant as the innocent head of an ad agency is pleasant. Amruta Khanvilkar looks marvelous as the Kolhapuri bombshell, but is completely miscast vis-à-vis her performance. The guys who come across as the true winners though, are Jeetendra Joshi, Pushkar Shrotri and Vikas Samudre as the three lovers who are denied their lady loves by the cool stud (?)Ankush. Each of their characters has unique quirks that seem pointless, but add a flavour to the comedy. They are involved in a series of madcap jokes and set-pieces that are delivered so convincingly by them, that you are willing to forgive their downright stupidity.Technically, the film has nothing to boast of. Colourful in its feel, it still leaves a lot to be desired in terms of production value. Also, though this might be a problem with the projection at the theatre where I watched this, it seemed that the framing at times was simply careless, with characters’ heads getting cut off for no apparent reason. The music of the film is purely functional. The fact that a couple of the songs have Hindi lyrics, however, is truly disappointing. It is hard to see a point in making a Marathi film that has Hindi songs. Ultimately, what manages to ensure that this film isn’t a complete waste is the fact that, quite like Priyadarshan’s Malayalam films of yore, a number of the jokes are such that they wouldn’t have been that funny in any other language. For that reason alone, I afforded a smile once the film was done.

662,1362,1362,1362,1362,Zhenda,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/zhenda-review/,,,,1.6,"Whether or not you have a political opinion; whether or not you are actively involved in politics; you are certainly affected by what goes on in the political parties. This is a gutsy view of the current behind-the-scene in Maharashtra. Strong dialogue, serious material and yet not preachy - we are exposed to a part of what makes this world filthy - good ol' dirty politics. ","A line in one of the songs translates to - 
There's no foreigner to burn you,
Nor a Gandhi to put out the fire
-   Implying of course, that there's a fire for sure. You have created it, you need to put it out. There's no enemy and no savior other than you.
Zhenda tells you what this fire is, in current-day Maharashtra. The political situation created by the power-controllers in the system, and the resultant change in social dynamics of the common man, including the party-workers. And it does so pretty efficiently and effectively.Some powerful, smart dialogues, some realistic performances, and a story that could be as real as possible - Zhenda is an intriguing affair right from the beginning. The first few minutes create curiosity about the complex political mesh prevailing in the state. And then you are introduced to nitty-gritty using a few representative examples - a couple of party-workers, an aspiring politician, their friends, family, and other supporters. It then comes down to two specific party-workers who are greatest of friends and as situation demands fall into different factions of political party. Each thinks he supports an ideology. But both are victims to blind faith and misguided loyalty. Though it's pretty much predictable that a film making a political comment will have character arcs that can go only a certain way, but it is interesting to see each one develop. The transition of each character is marked by the function of power he controls and the priority in his life. A non-believer in politics, an ace marketing guy, gains power and his priority changes from aspiring to move to the US to something completely unthought-of for him. A completely brainwashed political party-worker realizes his worth in the political system through his negative experiences and takes control of matters. The role of family and personal career growth is somehow inversely proportionate to the power you can exude. There are a few things that leave question marks. Is it so easy for a party-worker to go off on his own? And you try to convince yourself. Maybe - considering they aren't that valued in the first place. 
But that's the film. The bravery needed to make such statements and have a story and characters so similar to real life figures is a remarkable deed in itself. To take it a step further, and take on, arguably, a political family most ""popular"" for taking on to violence to prove a point - the Thakareys - could be considered martyrdom, by some. But, Avdhoot Gupte does it and does it well, without flinching. I am tempted to call it a documentary. A visual documentation of the situation created by our ""leaders"" in the state we live in, in the last few years. We, the ones who are not politically involved, at least not enough to join a party, are bystanders and get a peek into the lives of those who believe in their leaders with eyes closed. It is targeted towards these people and poses a question on their behalf -

O Lord, which flag should I hold up (support, fight for)?
And the only answer seems to be, ""none, really."" I wish the unsaid mention there is ""None other than your national flag, dear ones, none other than that…""

663,1363,1363,1363,1363,Zid,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review14 Critic Reviews 0.4/5.0 1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/zid-review/,0.4/5.0,3/5.0,,2.45,A whodunnit that goes about in so many circles that you stop wondering about who did it. ,"One of the main ingredients of a thriller that actually thrills ought to be a new revelation every once in a while. Zid doesn't even try. Sure, there are new things happening, but the suspects remain the same, the new events reinforce the suspicion on all the suspects equally. Interestingly enough, the reason you suspect people other than the story is trying to point a finger at vehemently, is because the film is so strongly doing so. By doing these things in combination and with a 2+ hour run-time, Zid doesn't keep your attention and you lose interest altogether by the end. Sure, the final twist is a good one, especially with what it implies about what you've been seeing so far. But unfortunately, it comes a little to late. Another thing that got to me was the spooky, horror-style treatment given to the film. We are not talking about haunted houses or unhappy, troubled spirits. So, I didn't quite understand why have an environment that makes you look out for a ghost through the film. Such horror films are known to be associated with some amount of sexual content too. Zid doesn't disappoint on the quantity it has on offer. The quality though is completely missing in terms of chemistry between the two involved. While you could fault the actors for that bit, it's not that they can't act at all. You see some hope in Karanvir Sharma because he shows great restraint when there was every scope to go over the board. While Mannara compensates for that bit by over-doing the crazy bit, every once in a while, she shows a slight change of expression which tells you she can do a good act if that's what she was directed to do. Shraddha Das on the other hand, holds just one expression - with the typical, sex-horror film glaze in her eye that every other lady in a film of this genre carries. That aside, the writing just doesn't engage you like a thriller should. It tries the known hooks that horror movies usually opt for when they know they can't keep you involved - cleavage and sex. Tells you how confident the makers were in the story they had to tell, which incidentally they try to boast about - their narrative capabilities. Unfortunately, it shows a lack thereof.

Best you keep away from them. To do that stay away from the film, please.","Zila Ghaziabad is a revenge drama that never should've been made. Just like Jayantabhai Ki Luv Story was a romance that never should've been made. Without an ounce of originality Zila Ghaziabad just seems like someone's fetish of watching two hours worth of action. Amidst this free-for-all shootout, it was hilarious then to see a bone being picked because a few of the goons wore fake police uniforms while shooting. Huh? That was the only objection that the keepers of law and order had? Other than that, there are maybe four or atmost five one-liners that might bring smiles, two of which would be innuendos. Almost every frame reeks of drama. And drama almost always means either loud background score or slow motion that goes on for a little more than would be needed to make the drama effective. But hey, what can you say, for this is a world where slo-mo defines the character who is  in focus - If he's being recorded in slo-mo means he is important, means along with other characters in the film, we should fear him.That is as deep as the writing goes. The three male leads could take each others' place or character and you wouldn't know. The women, calling them props would mean they had some significance in the film. Unless their role as being the one who is shot/kidnapped to get at another man, implies they have meaning in the life of the men or the film. With such a background then, do the men need to emote at all. And even if they try would it come across as anything but fake. Even so, you can see Paresh Rawal, Arshad Warsi and Ravi Kisen at least try. Sanjay Dutt and Vivek Oberoi on the other hand try to hard. The only interesting character then seems to be Fakeera (Sunil Grover) who plays Shakuni Mama in this supposed replay of Mahabharat. Just in case you miss the Mahabharat analogy you have a loud 'yada yada hi dharmasya' playing when Pritam Singh (Sajay Dutt) is in action. It's a different matter that any two sides waging war against each other with a cunning character could mean its trying to depict Mahabharat. So, to give that one a break you have Sanjay Dutt staring at a chess board and after much contemplation moving a pawn on the board as a first move! It doesn't end here, later you have two kings facing each other, two steps away from each other. Item numbers - two not one, cheesy one-liners, self-referencing jokes that's what makes up for the parts of  Zila Ghaziabad that aren't action. The action sequences itself are tedious almost in competition with the tiring drama.

665,1365,1365,1365,1365,Zindaggi Rocks,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review6 Critic Reviews 0.8/5.0,/movie/zindaggi-rocks-review/,0.8/5.0,,,3.95,,"Take away Sushmita and the rating falls to the last slot…that’s how much the movie is about Sushmita and her much-publicized rock star character, Kria. Sushmita’s acting evokes emotion - the audience smiles when she is happy and tears swell up when she is sad. It sometimes feels like you are seeing a slice from her real life. She looks gorgeous too - not breathtaking-gorgeous, but wow-she-is-so-sweet-gorgeous. She has designed her own outfits and they are dazzling. A Sushmita fan might not want to miss this one.  
For the rest, though, there is nothing much in there. Yes, Shiney Ahuja plays the doctor well, but since the story is all about the rock star, he can do only so much. He has some really insightful lines, especially when he is in the narrator mode. The other character artistes are just too loud and exaggerated. Most of them are have unnatural characters. Moushmi Chatterjee needs to do something about her diction. 
One of the best things in the movie comes towards the end. It is the symbolism between a poem that Kria is writing and the situation she faces, this is played out very artistically. 
The screenplay is very stretched out. There are many scenes, where the audience has enough time to think and say, “Okay, got the point, next please!”
The story is different and good, but the end is so prolonged that we realize what the climax is going to be an hour before the movie finishes. The suspense therefore is effectively ruined! Then, you just sit there waiting for it to happen. 
Of course, no opportunity is lost to put in a song. And why not? They have the perfect excuse! The atypical music is very easily overshadowed by the lyrics. To the eye though the songs are not much of a treat. The song that introduces Sushmita starts off as her performing on a stage and then becomes more like a video album giving it a very artificial look. Was somebody trying to save money by not doing a crowded, rock-show scene right through the song? And what’s with supposedly sensuous songs amongst unusually long white curtains? 
Not all the technical nuances are handled well. While most of the medical information given out sounds close to reality. But then, when there is a person dying, isn’t a doctor’s first reaction to take him/her to the hospital?!? There are flaws on the rock star side too. Like, can a rock star break into song wherever she pleases, isn’t she bound by contracts?

We are a generation that can afford to live life moment-by-moment. So, why aren't we. Go watch the film, before all the people who've loved it get you so excited about it that you are left disappointed. ","I loved Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. I don't know if it will last long enough to become classic or cult (never understood those terms). But, I enjoyed every single moment that I spent in that theater. Yes, even though it was a full two-and-a-half-hour-long film. Three friends are off to Spain to close on a deal they made with each other years ago - each will choose an adventure that the three of them have to experience together. The characters are alive, the cast is lively, the writer is thoughtful and the movie is clean, soft, perceptive entertainment.There is nothing profound about Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara; neither does it bring any insight that you and I don't already have from our own relationships. But, it connects from the word go. Maybe, I connected with it instantly because some of the things are too close to home. I've spent a lovely week-long, road-trip in Spain. I've walked through the little towns on their narrow, stone-bricked lanes. I've lived in the quaint hotels with their lovely lobbies.  And the cinematographer brings all of this alive. Spain, what a beauty you are! Add to this nostalgic mood, a piece of adventure that the three friends are experiencing. Deep sea diving, my latest addition to the ""I love"" list. And sky-diving which I've wanted to do (with my mom, no less!) for the last 15 years. The third adventure, uh...well...that one I think I'll play the woman card and leave it at, ""I'm happy to enjoy it vicariously through Abhay Deol, Farhan Akhtar and Hrithik Roshan.""Also fast getting on the list of ""I love"" are these three men! And goodness, even Katrina Kaif. Abhay Deol is instantly endearing as the sorted-out, problem-free, likeable guy who runs a little above average on emotion for a man. Farhan Akhtar's Imran is aptly described as an a$$hole. He plays the perfect shallow-outside-deep-inside, observant poet who doubles up as the comic relief. If I had to pick a weak-link it'd be Hrithik Roshan, but I'd be nit-picking about how his acting falls flat in the second half. He, after all, did get me annoyed with his ""oblivious to my arrogance"" attitude. Usually, introductions bore me; they are too in the face. And climaxes, disappoint me. The better the build-up towards it, the worse the fall in the end. Very few films manage the climax that is Goldilock's ""just right"". Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara's set-up is so subtle, that you don't even realize that's what it is till the opening credits begin. And the climax is yep, ""just right""! A minute more after that would have been too much. Yeah-yeah-yeah, there I do have my mandatory reviewer's disclaimer ""There are couple of flawed moments."" But you know what, they pass by quickly, and the fun/sweet moments are many more.Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara like zindagi itself, is about mistakes. It's about closure and the importance of closures. Because only then can we move on. Only then, can we have that new beginnings, we so deserve. ""Life is a once-only gift. Live it to the fullest.""  The cliché was alien to our parents. And is becoming the mantra of our responsibility-free generation. And why not? New money is becoming easier to get and even easier to spend. Savings is a dated concept. Because who knows? You might live long enough to enjoy retirement. Reminder: We live in a world of tsunamis and bomb blasts. So, there is merit to ""live the moment""So, when are you planning your next vacation? Fine, fine, take your time. Meanwhile, book your tickets before the praise that I've just showered upon the film raises your expectations so high, that they will only fall.

And yet, there is enough for the under-10s to enjoy indoors on a hot summer day. ","The set-up is as Harry Pottery as it could get. Orphaned child is used as a house servant by close relatives. He has two friends who make life livable for him. The plot deviates from here into bizarre situations. And somewhere in the strange world created, science is given all the credit. But, in the eyes of a 10-year old, it must all be fun. So, it'd be all right for kids to watch it when it comes around on TV.My issue with most of our stories is the lack of attention to detail. So our superhero 'zokkomon' doesn't have any superpowers, all he has is stuff enable by science. How then does he emit pretty lights around him? Maybe I'm just too scientifically challenged. But, it's all good because kids will oversee such stuff. They'll just be awed by the cool things this boy their age can do. That's what it looked like from the reactions of the kids sitting beside me. They were getting scared, exhilarated, laughing at all the intended points. And if it has worked for the target audience, it has worked. I think what worked is that the superhero didn’t go beyond his age; the pranks he played were well within a child's imagination. He stayed that age, he didn't grow up suddenly into doing larger than life stuff. Darsheel Safary's charming, not-overly cute persona works well with what he has to do in and as Zokkomon. And he's a good performer too. I loved his expressions in the roller coaster ride. On the other hand, Anupam Kher was annoying as Deshraj. I think I have something against obvious wigs. But his role as Magic uncle was pretty amazing. His makeup was awesome and so was his demeanour. A pity that our writers don’t believe in character-building. It's not like they can't or they don’t know how to, because they started something really interesting by having the yin and the yang, in the form of science and emotions. But it's not taken any further, there's no high point of conflict. Oh well, maybe that's too heavy for a kids' film. For what it is, the film is not good enough to haul the kids to a theater and cough up for the mandatory popcorn and soda. But it's perfect for a 2 hour off-time from kids when it plays on TV.

And of sensitizing them to issues like poverty too. Very in the face and forcefully shoves values down your throat.,"The words TRANSLUCENT replace the words 'Jai Ho' in the OSCAR-winning tune. And this is how my child is taught the meaning of translucent in his school. Educative, entertaining and to-the-point. Compare that to a film which is, in all likelihood made to entertain. Its target audience is obviously kids under 12. And all they do is moralize. Okay, mercifully there are no parents lecturing children, it's the other way around. And how? Not more than one or two adults amongst the entire cast and supporting cast of 50+ care about environment. And all, note ALL kids can lay down their lives to save the planet. If this one-dimensionality across characters was not enough, too many sub-plots are left without any closure - making you wonder why they were there in the first place. Not that you wanted more scenes with a huge sermon but at least some kind of an arc to the story would have helped. Again, the main story doesn't have too many ups and downs either. It starts with an issue, moves on the another one, magically resolving the first. Then it stays with the other one and drags ad nauseam. All child artists behave like kids who are practicing their lives' first skit at school - conscious yet self-important. The kids aren't given cute stuff to do either. The kind that would make you smile and at least keep you engaged, in the meanwhile. There are a number of references and spoofs of popular Hindi films, but I doubt many children would get the references because they might not have seen the original. And they are way to amateur and dull for adults to enjoy. Also no where are the happenings anywhere close to reality. For example, that these kids have parents who watch out for them, or look up on what they are up to at least once in a while, comes forth only in the last sequence. The climax though interesting because of its satire and the underlying truth is too late to redeem any part of the film. This is one of those that your kids might watch once and forget it soon-soon.

Both me and the film. Is it a coming-of-age story masked as  a family drama or a family drama masked as a coming-of-age story?,"An innocent looking boy to grow up into the protagonist, Dilsher with a thick stroke of dark grey. He can do anything to get what he wants. A viewer like me is hooked. I wait to see how it all turns out. I am intrigued by the air of mystery. And the film turns into a family drama – a couple in the midst of a cold war, a son with 'daddy' issues and so on. Somewhere in the middle of all of this, our protagonist is trying to come of age. Halfway into the film, it felt like the writer-director wanted to do it all in this film. What if, he didn't get a second chance? Only that can explain the “video album” style of picturisation and choreography of the songs. So what, if most of the songs are going to be on my playlist soon. The backstory for Dilsher's inner voice, in the form of Amira seems contrived and thus unnecessary. Dilsher's own discovery, that music is his calling, comes across as a by-product and not a destination that the film was aiming towards. The problem lies in the disproportionate screen time reserved for the Sikand family. Dilsher (Vicky Kaushal) is manipulating his way to impress Gurucharan Sikand (Manish Chaudhari). Sikan in turn, seems to have marital problems and doesn't like his son. Hmmm...you wonder why for half a second and you guess it – which is the 'big reveal' in the end. Yet, a viewer like me hopes till the end that you guessed it wrong.Anyway, that wasn't the purpose of the film, right? The idea was to tell the story of a boy who is trying to find his voice, himself. That bit is rushed up, almost as an after thought. Like an essay was prepared for an exam; the topic for the essay was “Voice”; limbs were added to the pre-packaged story to fit with the title. And of course, because it is an indie film, it has to carry some quirk – that is added in the form of camera work and sound design. The only saving grace then are the performances. Vicky Kaushal performs as if he is carrying a very huge burden on his shoulders – that of carrying the film. It gets an eager and sincere act out of him, but the load is unnecessary. Each time I watch Manish Chaudhuri, he instills and reinforces in me a fear – this character can do just about anything. Raaghav Chanana too does well as the insecure son who wears a mask of strength.However, performances and gray characters aren't enough to make Zubaan enticing. The story tries to do a little of everything. Therefore, every thing comes across as half-baked.
