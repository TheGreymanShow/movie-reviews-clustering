0,102 Not Out,Catch on TV/online for sure,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/102-not-out-review/,,5/5.0,,5,Quite the let-down after that brilliant trailer. There is always a silver lining when Amitabh Bachchan is in the frame though! That bit never goes wrong. ,"A parent’s job is never done. Even if they are 102 and going on 103, there is a quote of number-of-lectures-to-child-per-day that he has to fulfill. Dads will be dads. They will never stop doing what they think is good for you. Dad jokes will be dad jokes too! That is my first takeaway from 102 Not Out. What a brilliant concept it was – the relationship between a lively, devil-may-care this dad with his gloomy, resigned-to-life 75-year-old son. But naah, the film stops being innovative at the concept and picks the most predictable path going further. 102 Not Out ends up becoming the same ol’ coming-of-age movie, only that it is of a septuagenarian. It is quite literally as predictable as that. Sure, it does touch upon themes like some older people feeling needy and over-dependent on their children’s attention even as they live life making themselves believe that they understand their children’s disinterest in them. Hand-in-hand is the theme of a callous section of the younger generation whose sense of entitlement makes others in their own generation gape, wide-eyed with astonishment. These extremes take you away from empathizing with an otherwise pretty believable generation gap. Almost everyone in the audience has experienced this gap in real life, so it is a shame that the easily accessible opportunity to make you identify with it is lost. Some of these decisions on tone and style gave me the feeling that it was quite intentional. The sketches used for transitions are nicely done but unfortunately, come too often. The comic-strip like treatment where you are waiting for Dattatray to do next silly-yet-wise thing à la Calvin is amusing in the beginning, but gets repetitive and predictable within 10 minutes. The episodic treatment to the conditions, Dattatray (Amitabh Bachchan) has Babu (Rishi Kapoor) complete if the latter wants to continue staying with him, is another instance of a decision about tone that gets boring very soon. Interestingly, these things completely disappear in the second. Some other narrative stylistic decisions vanish too, but you don’t miss them because they were an ear-sore in the first place – the voice-over, for example. While Vijay Raaz’s voice is great as usual, the spoon-feeding done by his voice-over is completely unnecessary. The film jerkily becomes a tad more serious, and real-life like in the second half too. Another bit that unfortunately doesn’t do a disappearing act is Dheeru (Jimit Trivedi). The father-son duo’s man Friday has only function in the film – to represent the audience. He asks the questions we have, “Why is Dattray being so crazy?”, “What purpose does this action serve?”. Once asked, these questions are then answered in an explanatory monologue making it a told-didn’t-show narrative. So, you have this good-natured father who plays mind games with his what looks like clinically anxious son who also seems to have OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder). Mind games that in his mind are only for his son’s good. You have to remind yourself that this man was supposedly born in times when psychotherapy wasn’t all that popular. And despite all the wrong ways in which he tries to do the right things yet you want him to get more out of his life. You want this 102-year-old man to live on. This is not only because he is played by Amitabh Bachchan and it will indeed be a sad day when Big B passes away, but also because he makes you believe this manipulative old man is charming and has a practical mind with a golden heart. As usual, it is the other nuances that reaffirm my awe for the man’s talent. Amitabh Bachchan, a man who has lip-synced for a living over almost 5 decades convinces you that Dattatray is a bad lip-sync singer. I can’t think of any other person who does old and tired drooping shoulders better than this suave man who can give today’s models a run for their money on the ramp. Despite the character’s know-it-all attitude, only this actor can make a tear roll down your cheek even while he is giving the most predictable spiel. The same man can make you smile or even laugh every time he says, “Yo!” Rishi Kapoor stands up tall against him, scene-for-scene but Amitabh Bachchan owns the scenes even when he is over-acting, especially in the first half hour or so. Jimit Trivedi does what is asked off him, to play a simpleton who asks all the right questions, at all the right times. Their accents bring a smile at how authentic they should even though they all slip up every once in a while. Watch out for how Chicago is pronounced. Fortunately, the language used is very cute. Especially some of the Hindi words that are not often heard these days – in real life or in films. Other than that, 102 Not Out relies on old-school slapsticky tools like the mandatory toilet joke. Or the attempt to make you smile such as a music cue or a background sound. These work some times work and at other times you are indifferent to them, which is worse than them not working. There is a weird insertion in the form of an eye donation awareness scene. It was almost like, “Film about old people. Old people will watch it. Let’s push a relevant social agenda through.”However, after a long while, I liked a film’s music instantaneously. The title music is unique as a set-up song and reminded me of Barfi’s title song. The songs are lilting and I surely will want to hear them again. I feel the way in which the trailer is cut, is to blame largely for not being able to enjoy the film as much. It covers all the good lines and gives away the gist of the film, also foretells the ‘big reveal’ leaving zero element of surprise in the 10-15 minutes of exposition and little for the rest of the film. So, the trailer sets you up with great laughs and leaves very few for the theater. Also, the movie is a weird mix of concepts, and social and philosophical messages. A little bit of Anand, a little bit of Baghbaan, a little bit of cringe at having named those two films in one line. It becomes as much about letting go, as it is about a parent-child relationship and leaves you bored with both.

1,12 Angry Men,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review3 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/12-angry-men-review/,,3/5.0,,3,"12 jurors sit in a room, on the hottest day of the year and eleven of them are convinced that an 18-year accused in a murder is guilty. One man isn’t sure. That’s 12 Angry Men, Sidney Lumet’s gripping, edge-of-the-seat courtroom drama which went on to receive nominations for Best Picture at the Oscars and the Golden Globes and also win the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival in 1957. Stellar writing, and an outstanding directorial debut for Lumet. Must watch.","I’m a sucker for films which are based in a claustrophobic setting; where the characters cannot escape. Something like being caught in the lift for two hours. Or, being locked inside a house. Confinement, entrapment bring about interesting layers in human character. Perhaps that’s why I love prison dramas. 12 Angry Men is not a prison drama, it is rather a courtroom one. It doesn’t unfold in a courtroom, rather it is set in a room where 12 jury members must determine collectively whether the accused is innocent or guilty of the charge of first degree murder. From the looks of it, it seems like an ‘open and shut’ case. You begin to wonder how you’re going to sit through the next 90-odd minutes, if the case is so obvious.But Lumet’s mastery kicks in early into the film and he drops clever signs of an impasse in store. A hot afternoon, no air-conditioning, a wall-fan which refuses to work and a room which has to be remain locked until a decision is arrived at - all these hinting at the dead-lock in store, the nerves about to fly and heated exchanges set to unravel. Half-way through the film, it begins to rain outside and by the time the film ends, so does the rain. That the director has kept in mind nature’s background score, is impressive.My curiosity for this film piqued last month when I got my hands on to Lumet’s book, Talking Movies where he describes how he used a specific set of lenses to shoot 12 Angry Men - lenses which would make the room appear much smaller than it actually is - thus adding to the claustrophobia. He gradually adjusted those lenses in such a way, that as the film progressed, the room appeared even smaller - adding to the tension. You cannot see the ceiling when the film begins, but you can towards the last 20-odd minutes of the film, suggesting that even the roofs are caving in on to the characters, almost in protest, begging for a decision to be arrived at. I didn’t consciously notice these things while watching the film. But what I did feel was the rise in the adrenaline levels of the screenplay as the film progressed. Which means, each of Lumet’s tricks behind the camera worked.In the process, the story touched upon some major issues - not just how the judicial system debates on a judgement, but also made a valid case for why it is so important to question the obvious. It becomes clear that being in doubt, questioning the facts again and again and not being prejudiced are the holy grail of decision making. When the jury convenes to debate the trial and what the verdict should be, there’s only Juror No. 8 (Henry Fonda) who has a reasonable doubt of the accused being not guilty. The rest vote otherwise. As the film proceeds, his questioning zest spreads to other members in the room. Sparks fly and cans of prejudices are opened, as are empty heads filled with lack of interest and concern. The same jurors are caught wanting to swallow their own words.Each of the 12 jurors are interesting and unique in their own way. Hats off to screenwriter Regiland Rose for being able to seamlessly put to paper such different voices from the same pen. There’s an old experienced juror, an advertising executive, a man in a hurry to attend a baseball game, an adamant self righteous juror unhappy about his teenager son, an old hag who thinks the verdict is too obvious to debate about, a suave gentleman who remains composed in expressing his point, a naive apprentice, and a man who belongs to the same community as of the accused. That’s a diverse offering to place around a table.The film isn’t just about whether the accused is guilty or not, it’s rather about how much reasonable doubt does the existing evidence throw up. In cricket, we often refer to the term ‘benefit of doubt’. In this film we realise why it’s so important to consider even an iota of doubt and clear it out of the way. It could save an innocent’s life.Lumet extracts great performances from the cast. Fonda is certainly good, but its Lee J Cobb who steals the show in being his nemesis. A courtroom drama looks like an uncool choice on a Sunday afternoon, but the actors have enough layers in them to keep you involved, engrossed with them in helping them solve the mystery. A noteworthy feature film debut, Mr Lumet! Despite nil special features on the DVD, except a booklet, this one has enough in it to warrant a ‘must watch’. PS: Special mention to the Enlighten Home Library team for a very powerful DVD cover. Love the design!

2,12 Years a slave,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/12-years-slave-review/,,4/5.0,,4,"Steve McQueen's third feature, 12 Years a Slave, is star-studded and is mounted on a grander scale than his previous work. It turns out to be a mixed bag, however, because the film doesn't move you enough.","If you've watched Hunger or Shame, then your first impression of Steve McQueen's third feature, 12 Years a Slave, could possibly be that it's a loud film, by his standards; loud in every sense. Which is strange, because in many ways, the film is also like Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained under the influence of a sedative. Quite clearly, everyone can't pull off loud.Steve McQueen's usual tropes remain - an intense human drama, long takes, abrupt cuts that transport you to something completely different from the previous scene or shot; yet, 12 Years a Slave is a bit of a mixed bag. Despite the fact that McQueen has handled his considerably larger budget and star cast with relative ease, it still seems like too much of a departure for him.The film, which tells us the story of Solomon Northup, a 'free man' in the mid-19th century - indeed, a talented man and a musician - who is duped and then forced to be a slave. It follows an episodic structure - if slightly non-linear, as it flashes back and forth in time often - as he is sent from one owner to the next. Despite the fact that the film does hook you, and it affects you with some of the sheer brutality that slaves had to endure in those dark days of American and world history, the biggest problem with this film is that it doesn't move you enough. You expect McQueen to emotionally or intellectually stimulate you, but it doesn't happen.The character of Solomon Northup, who is the soul of the film, comes across as too uni-dimensional. For a man who has spent a bulk of his life being free, there is a certain placidity in the way he goes about things, choosing to display a spine in the most unnecessary situations, while meekly accepting his slavery, when in fact his protest should have been more vehement. The relationships he forms with the people around him just don't strike a chord. You don't see why you should sympathize with his character at all.And for once, Hans Zimmer disappointed me with his music score. Apart from the fact that it, like the rest of the film, is too loud for its own good, it also sounds far too similar to what Zimmer has been churning out for Chris Nolan lately. There's only so much you can invest emotionally into the atrocities committed on a human being, if the background score reminds you of Inception. After a point, then, I was looking forward to seeing some of my favourite stars making their cameo appearances one after the other. Benedict Cumberbatch, Michael Fassbender (whose look is quite superb in the film), and Brad Pitt keep things interesting. Chiwetel Ejiofor, who plays Solomon, is clearly committed to the part. He rises above the writing often, but is let down by the character more than anything else.12 Years a Slave talks about an important subject, and serves as a grim reminder of some of the horrific cruelties human beings have inflicted upon each other. It also creates a nice sense of period. But it's shortcomings lie in the narration of the story. You're simply left wondering about all those who saw far worse and for far longer, compared to which 12 years just doesn't seem so long at all.

3,127 Hours,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review3 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/127-hours-review/,,5/5.0,,5,"Aron Ralston is stuck under a boulder for 127 hours. This movie shows the ordeal that he goes through and his desperate attempts to survive. Being a true story, it is very inspirational and unnerving. Brilliant camera work, and excellent acting by James Franco make this one a good watch. Though some sequences may make you want to leave, because of the nudge that the flashbacks give you.","Mountain climber Aron Ralston gets pinned against a rock wall in a canyon in Utah for 127 hours, and his now famous feat for survival is captured in this film. The story is practically unbelievable until you hear that it is real, from the book “Between a Rock and a Hard Place” by Aron Ralston himself. It is about a life-or-death experience that one man goes through, and the courage and determination that he shows to keep himself sane through it. This is a man who believes in life, and knows that a body can do anything to survive. It is natural to have high expectations from Danny Boyle after his Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire. And true to his commitment and hard work, he gives us a film that leaves us thinking. It is a story not of a hero, but of a survivor. Screenplay is a wee bit stretched, but that really does build up the tension. Music is good, but we have certainly heard better from Rahman. The absolutely brilliant cinematography by Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle might as well get them an Oscar. It is the best part of the movie, apart from the captivating reality of the story, of course. The direction of photography is used to a very exciting effect, even after being confined to a tiny place with a literally unmovable man. Smart editing and the use of split-screen to present the adrenaline really worked. And the top views of the canyon to show the scale of operation are simply stupendous. James Franco does an excellent job as a hiker who loves the canyon and desert. He came off as a complete surprise to me, because I had only thought of him as Green Goblin’s cute son in the Spiderman series. Here, he is a thrill seeker who gets stuck in as bad a position as one can get into, where he has all the time to introspect and come out on the other side - a changed man. It is outstanding how Franco makes you feel the pain, the frustration, the hope, the disappointment. Every line on his face tells the story as he immerses himself in the role. Better still is the fact that the film almost entirely casts only him, and yet he manages to not bore the audience. In fact, there are scenes which bring goose bumps. Obviously, the film is overwhelming. I couldn’t sit through it in one go - had to take a break and come back. It could be because I couldn’t bear to look at the helpless situation, or it could be because the movie was not captivating enough. The gore – yes it does have big share of it (nothing outrageous though) – is still tolerable. What is not is the constant reminders of loneliness and hallucinations that are shown. I have no doubt that such circumstances could have the same effect on me, but it still is not very pleasant to watch. The flashbacks poke you, which makes you believe the film more and more with each scene. Though there was a lull in the flashbacks that Ralston takes you through, it still makes a good build up to what the film says in the end. It is more about a man’s invincible will to live than his unthinkable act for survival. I loved the way Boyle has made the film emotionally inspirational and about the values of life as against making it look like Saw.If you can’t take a little gore or can't watch continuous mental pain another person is going through, you’d rather not watch it. Else a must watch, and on the big screen for better impact.

Guy in front of you banging his head in despair: PRICELESSIt's nice to know you have company for your sentiment towards the movie, right? I've never fancied horror too much. But while watching 13B I was wondering what I dislike more - the squirms when the movie is done well or the annoying 'typical' camerawork and background score which make it unintentionally funny. Some of these standard techniques were just too in the face and obviously annoying. That the movie took a turn for the better in the latter half didn't help much, because by then the enthusiasm of watching the movie had worn off. And since the TV is doing the haunting and making accurate forecasts, you end up seeing everything twice - once in the TV prediction and then in the movie. And sometimes the makers feel obliged to repeat a dialogue or two even after the first repetition. And if not that, then the TV was spoon-feeding us just in case we missed the point that real life was replicating reel life. Not to mention that the appliances taking over life bit is rubbed in till you are just about to begin tearing your hair apart. And why is there such a lack of creativity in trying to horrify us? When was the last time violins rising up to a crescendo didn't bring snickers and eye-rolls? I was craving a normal, straight, non-close-up shot. Some bits are so slow that the director without a doubt knew that the audience would know what is about to happen. Then, why would he do that? And am I the only one bothered when 'the unknown entity' is obsessed with the house address without any rhyme or reason? Madhavan though does a good job of portraying Manohar's anger, his frustration, his vulnerability. The rest of the cast is just about ok. A potentially scary concept was completely messed up. But, just imagine this. All the soap operas on television - what if our real life starts replicating them. Or we believe that our lives are replicating them and they become self-fulfilling prophecies. Now, that's what I call horror!

Both by its thrills and its insensitive take on religion. Decent special effects cannot help forgive extreme irresponsibility in this age of communal riots.,"I've grown up fighting my fears by reciting the Hanuman Chalisa. Over time I grew into a person who believes that God doesn't need my praise to take care of me. I believe He exists and that's all I need to know. Yet I respect all who find peace of mind from performing rituals. BUT, when followers of one religion try to even imply that their religion is superior to another, I lose all respect for them. And that's what happened with 1920. I couldn't believe it when one religion succeeds at doing something that the other couldn't!So much so that I feel like taking points away from all the repulsive yet thrill-inducing quivers it successfully got out of me on the way to the climax. The finale though, just completely ruined whatever it was building up towards, by being both lame and offensive. Sure, the movie can be taken as a man's journey of losing and regaining his faith. But at the cost of demeaning someone else's belief - unacceptable!There isn't any special craft involved in the writing of the two distinct stories that make this movie either. Unrequited love and undying love brings havoc and redeems soul respectively. There are a few creative lines strewn around but nothing remarkable about the effort as a whole.Just when the deadpan expressions of both the lead actors, Rajneesh Duggal and Adah Sharma, and the haggard pace were beginning to bring a yawn, the story began inching forward.  And I was in complete awe of the many ways in which Adah's body managed to contort, turn, wiggle, and squirm. Her facial muscle movements, make-up, and the special effects all contributed to both the disgust I felt towards the ghost possessing her and how sorry I felt for her character. Rajneesh's face and eyes on the other hand remained blank. Points for consistency?The only things I knew about the movie beforehand were that it's set almost a century ago, and that it belongs to the horror genre. Horror translates to shrill background music and weird camera work, so I was all prepared for that. But, I was pleasantly surprised. In fact the opening sequence had very little music for accompaniment. An eerie ambience was created, alright.Yet, it didn't escape the standard questions one would have of ever-predictable Hindi horror movies. How come a person who turns out to be dissatisfied enough after death invariably resides in a mansion? What stops this ghost from getting out of the mansion? In this particular case it wasn't as if this ghost was attached to the mansion? I guess, a haunted mansion makes more movie-worthy material than a haunted shanty.But, the main glaring, making me fume question remains - How? How can one make such an insensitive movie about religion when it's being used to commit so many atrocities to serve God-alone-knows-what agenda? Freedom of expression, huh? Irresponsible usage - I say...

This is only the excuse to show some disgusting kind of gory horror. ,"My usual problem with horror films made in the Bhatt fashion is there seems to be no underlying theme other than revenge. Given that, the story is predictable - good vs evil spirit. Scary faces and noises scaring the daylights out of badly made up women, some loophole hocus-pocus and ta-da evilness of the spirit is taken care of. With 1920 Evil Returns, there is no revenge per se, but the premise for the spirit to be evil is  so lame that revenge looks like at least a plausible reason for nastiness. The buildup towards the mystery of what might be the cause for Smriti's (Tia Bajpai) situation is slow and relaxed. While the mystical way it is done in is just about alright, it crumbles down within a few minutes and a voiceover reading out a letter, in a very unengaging fashion. And like one would expect, the writers don't seem to care what causes the spirit to cause so much harm, as long as they get to write down their contorted imagery of a haunting spirit.The imagery though is brought out well by the combination of Tia Bajpai, the special effects team and the make-up artists. Aftab Shivdasani is appropriately restrained and confused, thus expressionless and Vidya Malavade is extremely superficial in expressing herself. Tia Bajpai on the other hand, must have been exhausted mentally, physically and maybe even emotionally after some of the scenes in which her character is possessed. But then, when she is not possessed, Tia's dialogue delivery is annoyingly honey-coated. So much so that you wished the parts where she was possessed were back, at least then you can feel sorry for her. Anyway, for a person who likes the thrill provided by horror, the last half hour of 1920 Evil Returns might be well worth the time spent on the film. To me it was just the disgusting kind of gory. However, I did like the basic concept of the evil spirit taking advantage of its body's sudden death and the means it uses to express how much hatred it feels inside. But too little too late. Those are concepts that can actually be explored in another story.I also liked how the possessed is out in the clear right in the beginning and there is no time spent in building up that aspect of the standard evil-spirit horror film. But, the writers got lazy and just wrote a turn of events which brought everything back to square one. Such a shame, again.Creaking doors, background music that builds up and climaxes, extra sweet, innocent lady possessed by a evil spirit who just won't let go - yep these and many more standard ingredients of a horror film trying hard to scare. It doesn't really scare, but it does get repulsive in some parts.

Not that this subject has been dealt with earlier. And even if the other aspects are just a little above average, it’s the details in the story itself and the narration style that make this movie worth watching. Certainly worth a watch.","Don’t write it off as yet another war movie. For one, it is more an ‘escape’ movie than a war movie. Secondly, it is a warm movie. It makes you think of the futility of it all - the partition, the wars themselves, the retention of the prisoners of war. The beauty of the movie lies in how focused the story is. There is no dilly-dallying, no silly or non-silly sub-plots. This is one of those rare scripts that can be appreciated without awesome or awe-inspiring dialogues. It has a gripping well-paced screenplay which surprises you, shocks you, and disturbs you. The dialogues are simple without being inane. In fact the restraint used in avoiding over-the-top heavy lines is simply admirable.  The very expected “Pakistan-bashing” dialogues are conspicuous by their absence. The background music is beautiful. However, my problem was with the over-use. The quality is ruined by the quantity. There was background music almost throughout the movie and it was loud – louder than the dialogue at times. The acting by all the lead actors is not top-notch but is good enough not to distract you from the story. It’s the dialogue delivery of the supporting cast that is…weird. The actors playing roles in the Pakistani military brought laughs where none are warranted. And why-oh-why was the helicopter pilot doing a Dev Anand? No single scene might jerk tears but it surely brings a lump in your throat when the credits roll – not with the names of the crew members but with names and pictures of the real prisoners of war - the men who put their lives on line so that we could live comfortably.

8,2 States,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review41 Critic Reviews 2.9/5.0 1 Reader Review 5/5.0 113 Tweet Reviews 4.1/5.0,/movie/2-states-review/,2.9/5.0,5/5.0,4.1/5.0,4,Debutante director Abhishek Varman gives us a Chetan Bhagat adaptation that doesn't attempt to offer any more heft than what the book does. It provides instant gratification primarily because of a charming lead cast and an excellent supporting cast that rises above the rather tame writing.,"*I am out on a vacation. Pradeep has been kind enough to review the film for wogma. So here goes...    ~ meetu* 2 States is the kind of film that is most likely to give you exactly what you expect from it; and that isn't necessarily a good thing.A young, vibrant love story between a Punjabi boy and a Tamilian girl - or, as we Indians seem to revel in relegating to highly generic region-based nomenclature as 'North Indian' and 'South Indian' (for the record, 'North India' and 'South India' are not places!) - 2 States gives you a thoroughly engaging lead pair amidst stereotypical humour taking off on the respective states. (The showy Punjabi or the condescending Tamilian, for instance.)That the attractive leads are going to fall in love with each other is a given. Arjun Kapoor and Alia Bhatt occupy the screen as well as their young, yuppie characters with ease. They play off each other well; to use a cliché that should have been abolished even before slavery was, they share 'great chemistry'. What is also nice to see is the easy manner in which the couple - both the boy as well as the girl - handles intimacy, without it being made as big a deal as we're used to seeing in our movies. In fact, the scenes featuring just the couple are rather refreshing. In the context of our big mainstream cinema, this is the closest we've come to capturing the spirit of how the youth of today treat relationships.But in India, love is the mere beginning. The hard part is convincing the respective sets of parents, particularly when it so happens that they lie on opposite sides of the great cultural divide brought forth by the mighty Vindhyas.In terms of plot, the film stays largely faithful to the Chetan Bhagat novel it is adapted from. One can safely say that 2 States isn't Bhagat's worst bit of writing, though that isn't particularly saying much. Where the film falters, despite being largely watchable, is precisely where it should actually have been the strongest - in the conflict that prevents the couple in love from ending up together. If the romance portions are breezy and make you smile often, the portions involving the parents look like they belong to another film, one that was set a few decades back. True, the Punjabi-Tamil (or, North-South, if you prefer it) clash is meant to evoke comedy, but it comes across as too forced. It's hard to digest the kind of acrimony seen in the film in this day and age, even though the reluctance of the older generation is still very much a reality. Another sore point in the film is the relationship that Arjun’s character Krish shares with his father played by a suitably gruff Ronit Roy. It keeps cropping up through the film, but is never once fully explained.The film is also sinfully long. At two and a half hours, considering the demographic the film is aimed at, the film is a good thirty minutes too long. The climax of the film drags on and on, and then drags some more, before ending exactly where you knew it was going to end. The film also follows a forced non-linear narrative that just doesn't seem to have a point. Why it moves back and forth in time is a mystery, when it would have worked just the same as a flat-out linear narrative.The real takeaway from the film, then, is the manner in which the supporting cast, the four parents to be precise, create characters that are at once over-the-top yet believable. Revathy and Amrita Singh, in particular, are top notch. While Arjun is earnest and Alia brings spunk, verve and spontaneity to her part, they aren't faced with the task of creating distinct characters, the way the senior actors are.   It would have helped immensely if the film had a more memorable soundtrack, though a couple of songs are quite catchy, to be fair. When you walk out of 2 States, then, one isn't likely to be absolutely gushing about it, nor will one be particularly annoyed by it. It just gives you what it promises - tolerable enough fun for just as long as it lasts.

9,21,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/21-review/,,,,4,,"Based loosely on the real-life story of a group of MIT students who ended up taking on Vegas casinos at their own game, 21 offers an entertaining alternative to the usual muliplex fare.Jim Sturgess stars as Ben Campbell, MIT grad student and aspiring Harvard entrant, who finds himself swept up into the secretive MIT Blackjack team. Sturgess puts in a nicely layered performance, appearing equally believable as his character moves between geeky college boy and Vegas high-roller. Kate Boswoth chips in as likeable fellow team member Jill Taylor. Sadly, despite a decent performance, Bosworth finds her character mainly utilized as the love interest rather than as a strong female lead.Aaron Yoo, Liza Lapira and Jacob Pitts (as Choi, Kianna and Fisher respectively) make up the remaining team members, ably led by Kevin Spacey as college professor (and team mastermind) Mickey Rosa.Of course, a nemesis is required, and Laurence Fishburne is well suited to the role of casino security chief Cole Williams. Despite not much material to work with, the ever-reliable Fishburne gets the job done and brings depth to his character.Although inspired by the real-life adventures of the MIT Blackjack team, 21 is still very much a dramatized account. In fact, there has been some controversy surrounding the Hollywoodization of the story; particularly in the ethnic makeup of the cast. In real life, the MIT team members were predominantly of Asian-American descent. But in the movie account, the key players are caucasian.Controversies aside, director Robert Luketic ensures that the story rolls along smoothly and does a skillful job of explaining the statistical principles behind card counting without boring the audience.Of course, whenever card games are depicted in cinema, there’s always some explanation required, even for a game as simple as blackjack. In 21, this exposition is less clunky than say, in Casino Royale, but it’s still there. Still, in the trade-off between clarity and economy, Luketic makes the right choices.Despite this, several of the scenes rather feel like they were shoehorned in to perk up the drama. I have sympathy for the filmmakers here – how do you sustain audience interest for two hours in a story about college kids playing cards? – but it’s not hard to spot the melodramatic scenes injected to add spice to the story.On balance, the movie is well-paced and still keeps a few surprises in store along the way. It also poses a few interesting questions - how does money change us? What really counts as ‘winning’ or ‘losing’?As welcome departure from the usual roster of summer blockbusters, 21 is well worth a watch.

10,21 & Over,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review,/movie/21over-review/,,,,4,"The directorial debut of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore – writers of The Hangover – 21 & Over is a film that tries to be in the same vein as the former, but fails quite miserably. Mostly inane, sometimes indifferently bad and very, very rarely amusing, it can easily be avoided in favour of mowing the lawn or recounting the alphabet backward instead.","There is no dearth of morons in this world, and clearly, there is a whole genre of films that tries to show how much fun it is to have a laugh at a moron’s expense. 21 & Over has its fair share of moronic characters, but is a consistently unfunny film packed with gags that were outdated this time last century. An exhausting comedy that tries its best to channel similar films in the genre – The Hangover, Superbad, American Pie and the likes – but failing quite miserably, 21 & Over is the kind of film that makes 93 minutes seem like an eternity. Surprisingly enough, the film is written by and is the debut directorial effort of the writers of The Hangover, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. Jeff Chang has just turned 21, and his oldest buddies - the obnoxiously in-your-face Miller and the nerdy aspiring-Wall-Street-guy Casey – land up at his doorstep after years being out of touch, to take him pub-hopping and to generally show him a good time. Except that Jeff Chang has a career-defining interview the very next morning, and his father is in absolutely no mood to let him do anything that would jeopardize his interview and his career. Not that anything is going to stop Jeff Chang’s friends, Miller in particular, from having their way. Then begins a night of migraine-inducing silliness that never seems to end.Apart from a few moments in the film that you can’t help be amused by, the film is very clearly trying too hard. True, Miles Teller, Skylar Astin and Justin Chon - who play Miller, Casey and Jeff Chang respectively – manage to keep their energy levels consistently high. But there is only so much that an enthusiastic cast can do, when the writer-directors are finding it so hard to rise above banality. The film primarily relies on stereotypes and racism to be funny, with booze, puke and nudity being their second line of attack. Unsurprisingly, none of these works.Packing proceedings with everything, from an irritable group of jocks, annoying sorority girls, a hairy, semi-nude, self-proclaimed Master of something that I don’t remember, to a nut-job wearing an Indian chief’s headdress, the film tests your patience throughout. And with a feeble attempt at being a coming-of-age story as well, where the film tries to tell you that you should follow your heart and do what makes you happy, the film manages to lose a plot that it never had in the first place. One would think that an hour and a half isn’t too much to take, but believe you me, this film feels way longer than that. It doesn’t help that even technically, the film is quite weak. It has an all-too-generic look about it and has some choppy editing, though I strongly suspect some of it is because of abrupt cuts suggested by the Indian censors. Fact remains that in a poor film, weak technique stands out even more, something that this film suffers from as well. Predictable, asinine and always puerile, 21 & Over is truly a film that just doesn’t need to be watched. For silliness that invokes some genuine laughs, I’d suggest you just revisit The Hangover on DVD instead.

11,22 Female Kottayam,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/22-female-kottayam-review/,,5/5.0,,4,"A fresh voice in cinema will always find appreciation. Director Aashiq Abu narrates a love story gone wrong with a young, insightful perspective that deserves to be lauded. Combine that with a fresh cast and you get a neat little thriller that engages in spite of a narrative that tends to sag.","“Well, let's just say I like to live dangerously.” – Tommy PlymptonAs the end credits of 22 Female Kottayam roll, the first credit that appears reads ‘Filmography’, and it lists three films that ’22 Female’ is inspired from. While two of those three films would make it to my all-time favourite lists, even those to whom the films are not as special would see the similarities that these films share. Naming those films, of course, would be a thorough disservice to those who are yet to watch 22 Female Kottayam.Tessa K. Abraham is a Malayali nurse living and working in Bangalore, who is looking to settle in Canada. In the quest for her visa, she meets Cyril, a man who runs a visa agency. With his school-boyish charm and earnestness, Cyril wins Tessa over and love blossoms. But stories never end when the boy and girl fall in love, do they?While 22 Female Kottayam is a thriller, which has been appreciated because it is at its core an engaging fiction story, why it really needs to be lauded is because of its treatment. Director Aashiq Abu, in the course of narrating the tale, shows rare insight into the life of a young, city-bred woman living in a cosmopolis in India. Women check out a man’s posterior, they don’t fear revealing that they aren’t virgins before getting into a relationship, and some young women get into relationships of convenience with older, married men. All these, and more, are truths with no notions of morality affecting them, and a majority of India is yet to come to terms with it even in real life. Cinema, then, is still some distance away. But Aashiq Abu and his writers weave their story around these facets of life, and therein lies the truth behind why 22 Female Kottayam is being hailed as a path-breaking film.The film however, is far from perfect. Both halves of the film are starkly different from each other, and though one can see that the makers have tried to let each side of the story build slowly, the fact remains that the film tends to sag. There are long stretches which are devoted to establishing and then re-establishing what has been established, rather than carrying the story forward. And this repeats throughout the film. Had the film been pruned by 20 minutes or so, it could have possibly been more impactful.Rima Kallingal, who plays Tessa, has a mysterious presence that is always smouldering just below the surface. She looks convincing throughout, even though she isn’t naturally blessed with the acting mettle to pull off the complex character that she portrays. She manages to hold the film up, for which she needs to be lauded. However, I couldn’t help wonder if the film would have turned out better if a more competent actress had played the part. Fahad Fazil as Cyril is excellent. He isn’t a typical Malayalam film hero and he’ll never be able to pull off the grand entrances that some Malayalam superstars make. Instead, he is like a counter-balance to them. Fahad Fazil could possibly be the poster boy for the new paths that commercial Malayalam cinema seems to be treading. Prathap Pothen, in a rather pivotal role as a father figure to Cyril makes a mark.Where 22 Female Kottayam lacks the most is the music. A story like this would have been served well if it had that one hooking piece of music, that one melody which haunts the viewer even hours after he has left the cinema hall, which helps him relive the tale he experienced. 22 Female Kottayam is a film that can be appreciated better with its second viewing in the theatre, but it will possibly miss out on its repeat audiences because of the lack of enduring music. Still, with its twisted, engaging story and effortlessly slick cinematography, the film is bound to draw the claps that I heard once the end credits roll.

12,3 10 to Yuma,Owner's Pride!,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/3-10-to-yuma-review/,,5/5.0,,4,"Gritty, realistic action movie, set in the Wild West. A glorious film, embodying the best of a genre that has nearly vanished from the screens.","For some reason, the Western as a Genre of film making has all but vanished from our screens (the writer has his views on the subject, but that would constitute a different article!). The Western was the quintessential embodiment of the Great American myth; the promise of the New Land, the wide open Frontier where a man could become rich irrespective of his class and background, and of Men who in wild and brutal times, stood for justice and fair play that was the heart of the American dream. They featured the lone Hero, who stood up for truth and honour and acted with courage when required. The Western genre has been used as an allegory (High Noon – 1952) and also as an ode to the Romantic outlaws who had to give way in the face of commerce and early capitalism (Sergio Leone’s all time classic, How the West was Won, and Sam Peckinpah’s spectacularly bloody The Wild Bunch). Clint Eastwood gave the genre another twist altogether in the 1990’s with Unforgiven, a dirty unflinching look at the entire myth of the Western and the American Dream. And now after years, we have 3.10 to Yuma. Director James Mangold has helmed several films before, but never a Western.  Indian viewers might remember Identity, a complex murder mystery, which was on show around five years ago.  Let me state right at the outset, this film is not an action film. If as a viewer you are interested in chases and gunfights, well, then this film is not for you. This is not to say that there is no action; in fact it has a first rate stagecoach chase, quite a few gunfights, and a great climax featuring lots and lots of guns and shooters. But the difference is that the action is not meant to entertain and elicit “oohs and aahs”, but is instead used to give us insights into the possible personalities of the characters. This requires a well forged screenplay which pays attention to small nuances to delineate characters and also an accomplished director, and it is here that both Mr. Mangold and the writers distinguish themselves.The screenplay works wonderfully to give us a whole bunch of people whom we remember long after the film is over. A ruthless and yet quite honest criminal who is also a charmer when it comes to women, a war veteran rancher deep in debt, a veterinarian who cannot shoot, a grizzled bounty hunter on contract, a trigger happy young outlaw, the young but somewhat fearful railroad man, an adolescent boy struggling to be a man; they somehow seem so real and present, that you empathise deeply with them and their circumstances. The director has followed one of the truisms of cinema, about cinema being all about reaction rather than action, and he gives us tight close ups of the characters’ faces, as contrasted to the panoramic country that they are traveling in. The dialogue is laconic and terse, and weaves in themes of justice and morality. The film does not sing hosannas to the American dream; instead it very subtly shows us the hypocrisy, the exploitation, and the greed that made America what it is today. There is a sequence where we are shown Chinese laborers building railroad tunnels, cheap labour that was brought to America to build most of its railroad and also work the mines. In a passing shot we see an encounter between the young adolescent white boy and a Chinese laborer of nearly the same age, and the reaction on their faces says it all, about race and class.  We also come to understand that law and legal rights are almost always subordinate to economic interests. Russell Crowe is outstanding as the bad guy Ben Wade, his puffy face and the lines around his eyes speak volumes about his dissolute, yet intelligent personality. Christian Bale’s hard planed face is something that is not easy to forget either; his misery and anguish come through in his muttered dialogues and in the set of his jaw. The film ends in a bloody and brutal climax which is well staged and leaves us feeling vindicated, in a manner that we really do not understand. Again here the director shows his class, the final interactions between the outlaw and the rancher as well as the closing scenes, weave in the earlier themes and bring them to a most satisfying resolution. The end remains true to the genre; about how Men must make their stand irrespective of how the bullets may fly and what it means to be a Hero. Thank God for the Bollywood multiplex brouhaha, let us have more such films please. PS And for all those who love pulp Western novels and films and the guns that feature in them, this movie has the works, the Spencer carbine, Colt revolvers, Remington sawed off shotguns, and the Gatling.

13,3 A.M.,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review16 Critic Reviews 0.9/5.0 1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/3-m-review/,0.9/5.0,5/5.0,,5,3 AM suitably horrifies for a good part of the film before it cops out in a hurry towards the end.,"I am spooked easily and maybe that is why I am not too fond of horror films. So, it is very difficult for me to understand what ""liking"" a horror film would feel like or what a ""good"" horror film is. In my mind then, I translate my feeling for a horror film to be good if it manages to spook me more than what is normal for me. With that disclaimer at your disposal, 3 AM is a decent horror film till it loses steam in the last half hour, that is.Its time for another disclaimer. When I say I get spooked easily, it doesn't mean a regular Hindi horror film that is actually a comedy masquerading around as a horror film. It is when the characters get me involved enough to care for them; when I don't want the ghost or the spirit to trouble them. And this bit 3 AM manages reasonably well by building the chemistry between Sunny (Rannvijay Singh) and Sara (Anindita Nayar) and the camaraderie between Sunny and his friends Cyrus (Salil Acharya) and Raj (Kavin Dave). Of course, for this first you have to get past some major loopholes in the character development like why would Sunny get Sara or even Cyrus and Raj into dangerous situations without any backup. But, once you are willing to accept that and move on, there are a few chilling moments and some eerily long, uncomfortable sequences in the dark.The kind of lingering sequences which make you want it to be dawn at 3AM or the characters to break into a dance number in the middle of the haunted building. The exact kind of thing I would scoff at, if it were to happen. And it does happen, and there is relief. Except that the relief stays too long and the tension fails to build back to the same level. The rest of the story is pretty much your average horror film story. Haunted building, evil spirit, innocent killed, search for truth by the survivors, impending disaster. The only thing to keep you going is the way the spookiness is executed. It boils down to the sound, light and the performances. Editing in and out of monochrome handycam recording and in general a dark environment gives 3 AM's horror bits a good eerie backdrop. Add on, the minimal use of background music and heavy reliance on sounds to set the chill at the right level. The mere absence of typical Hindi horror films violins and creaks is good enough to make any horror film reasonably scary. The performances aren't half bad either. The characters make the usual horrified faces and scream and display pain appropriately. None of it too distracting. Rannvijay Singh, Salil Acharya and Kavin Dave all give engaging performances in the horror scenes. The rest of the film though, they all look a little too affected. Anindita Nayar is the regular horror expression-less, supposed x-factor lead lady of the film. She doesn't have too big a role and isn't required to emote much.3 AM, thus, had all the ingredients needed to execute an average horror product. Where it fails is in keeping the momentum up through to the end. Even if it had lost its enthusiasm in the climax, it could've been overlooked. But, the energy drops a good half hour before the end, as if it became too intense for the makers themselves. Even though 3 AM leaves room for a sequel with a very interesting premise, this one is a little bit of an anti-climax, a little bit of a cop-out, a lot of a mood-dampner. So what, if I am not complaining?

14,3 Days to Kill,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/3-days-kill-review/,,,,5,"3 Days To Kill, directed by McG, is a predictable action-thriller about an ex-CIA agent with family issues. A silly, sometimes funny, but mostly pointless film, it is mercifully brisk and short, making it an easy watch.","Liam Neeson must've been busy when they were casting for 3 Days To Kill; for this role seems right up his alley. That's the first sense you get as you settle into the film and get acquainted with soon-to-be-ex-CIA Ethan Renner, played by Kevin Costner. Because, you see, Ethan has daughter issues.Yes, on paper there's very little about Charlie's Angels director, McG's latest film that you haven't seen or heard before. And like most CIA/espionage/high-stakes-crime based films, this one too is prone to many lapses of logic.What makes the film not so difficult to sit through is the undercurrent of humour running through it. Combined with Kevin Costner's deadpan portrayal of his character, it gives some genuine laughs, something that really surprised me, considering the CIA backdrop that the film promised.After a point you realize that the silliness is rather the point of the film than a flaw in it. Ethan Renner, after quitting the CIA, is again enrolled for one last job, with a carrot that is dangled before him; one he just can't say no to. In the midst of it, he attempts to patch things up with his estranged teenage daughter Zooey. All of this, for some reason, is set in Paris - which at least lends the film a certain amount of texture in terms of place, even if it is on a superficial level.Ethan's relationship with his daughter is devoted nearly as much time as the action portions of the film, and most of the humour in the film is derived from how they end up intersecting a few times. Interestingly, these two threads of the film are also shot and cut quite differently. The portions with his daughter have a warmer, slower feel to them, while the CIA bits have a cold colour tone, with rapid cuts (which are often random and distract from the action.) In the middle of it, there is the mysterious CIA operative Vivi, who actually recruited Ethan for this one last job. She has an inexplicable air of mystery about her, in terms of what she wears and where she spends her time, none of which is ever explained properly. The biggest letdown of the film, once you get used to how silly it is, is the fact that a lot of mystery is built up, but it all fizzles away for a lame, predictable ending. There are many unanswered questions but you're too bored to ask them anyway. The film is, in fact, predictable for the most part, save for one sudden pre-climax twist that you never expected initially - but seems obvious in retrospect. Again, it is left to the humour in the film to make it tolerable, which it does. Costner and Hailee Steinfeld, who plays his daughter, have an easy chemistry about them. There is no real depth to the father-daughter relationship, but it still makes you smile. Amber Heard as Vivi looks stunning, but all you can think about is what is the point of her at all. The film is also sorely hurt by the lack of a clear and powerful antagonist to Ethan Renner's character.You experience the film, then, not knowing if it has any point at all. In fact, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was watching a silly Hindi rip-off of a mediocre Liam Neeson thriller. That, really, sums up the 2 hours of 3 Days To Kill.

15,3 Idiots,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma reviewNotepad52 Critic Reviews 4.4/5.0 132 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/3-idiots-review/,4.4/5.0,4/5.0,,4.166666667,"Though 3 idiots is a little more slapsticky than the Munnabhai series, the crass humor seems to be with a purpose. What remains fascinating is the blend of comedy with his social messages, as usual. He makes being good look so simple. ","It is so simple to be good in Hirani-land. You beg, borrow or steal with good faith to be a lovable, charming person in the land of idiots. And how much ever I hate the use of fiction in a realistic set-up, I end up enjoying each of his worlds. Maybe because, like most people, I want to believe that it is possible to be good in this mean-mean world. Also it's nice to see a comment on the educational system and the Indian-parent psyche, both competing to kill invention and creativity. In fact, this time around, it felt like Rajkumar Hirani has taken it upon himself to challenge every single complaint that I have against typical Hindi masala films. I hate slapstick. He uses it - it's justified after all (the setting is a boy-dominated college and an all-boy hostel.) And DAMN! He makes me laugh at Mr. Bean-Tom & Jerrystyle jokes. And out loud at toilet and sex-related jokes! :( He uses that sttuppid marriage-melodrama scene. Yet, I'm egging the bride on to run away, completely disregarding the little change in plan-of-action that Hirani employs. As in typical slaptick comedies the actors ping-pong between loud and melodramatic. You can call that brilliant acting, or say you cannot judge the actor because he is doing what the genre demands - take your pick. Then there's that slapsticky, loud background music too. And the list goes on. I want to hate this man's guts, but can't help admire the way the typical toilet-humor so fluidly mixes with the insight that comes next. Though I fear he's taking the slapstick a little further with each of his ventures. A little further towards making the content appeal to the palate of the ""masses"". Be it the overuse of songs or clichés which are smartly covered under the guise of spoofs. Using a 40 year old actor to play a 17 year old. It is mildly irritating this time, the next time the annoyance might increase.But that doesn't mean he hasn't taken any risks. The lead lady Pia (Kareen Kapoor) makes her first appearance on screen only in the 45th minute of the film. The kind of humor he uses itself is risky. Such serious, sensitive, and real issues are laughed at whole-heartedly - by the characters. Such dark humor! And well, the audience too was laughing, but that doesn't reduce the risk taken, right? This might be the most obvious statement that one can make about the film, but how can you not say it when you have seen it. This film would have been hollow without its dialogues and their delivery. And despite the occasional shallow humor. And even if a few of them are sms/e-mail forwards. Its what they lead up to that's more engaging. All fingers point back to the man, Rajkumar Hirani, who has written the dialogues and directed their delivery. While some of the phrases coined will become references in everyday conversations, the mantra ""Aal izz well"" has been taken to the extreme in the film's writing. The screenplay makes sure the audience knows from the beginning that ""aall izz well"" in the end. So, yeah, you can call it predictable. And some of the events are predictable because the screenplay has given that one extra second for you to think and guess what's going to happen next. But those are semantics. The point raised or answered after that predictable moment is not something you'd think of - at least not all the time. Another huge element of writing - characterization - is mostly done by use of caricatures. From Chatur/Silencer to Prof. Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani); from his supposedly-soon-to-be son-in-law to even Rancho (Aamir Khan), they all look like they are out of a comic book. But then you have seen a character like that in your circle of friends - the one who names the price/brand of an object before you ask for it, the one who is competitive ad nauseum, the one who spouts philosophy every third second. But that lingering element of masala is not to be missed. There are no gray characters. Rancho, for example, has huge strokes of Raghu from Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Bawarchi. But there was still something mysterious about Raghu, something that made you curious about him. But here, you know Rancho could do no evil even if he wanted to.And yet Rancho makes you laugh, he jerks your tears. One or the other emotion is at a high, all the time. But, the question I have about all films that give a ""message"" in a lighter vein - will the laughs stick or the message? Will we just laugh every time someone says ""o bhaiyya, aal izz well"" or will we subscribe to the fact that ""all's well""?

16,300: Rise of an Empire,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review3 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/300-rise-empire-review/,,4/5.0,,4.166666667,"There isn’t much to be enthralled about in the sequel to 300; 300: Rise of An Empire is a bit of letdown in almost every manner, except for a surprisingly thrilling turn by Eva Green. Watchable enough for hardcore fans of the genre and the first film, but the lower your expectations are, the better.","In a movie that is expectedly all about the violence and bloodshed that its prequel so gorgeously glorified, you’d think that you’d walk out of 300: Rise of An Empire thinking about all the red you saw. On the contrary, the most striking thing about the sequel to 300 is Green; no, not the colour. I’m talking about Eva Green, who delivers a knockout performance – relatively speaking – as the battle thirsty commander of the Persian naval forces, who are out to raze all of Greece to the ground.In fact, it is so unfair that war is considered the domain of men; because in this film, the women quite clearly outshine them. Even Lena Headey, reprising her role as Queen Gorgo, gets very little screen time, but still is far more impressive than the men-folk in the film.A lot of the events in this film actually occur at the same time as what we saw in 300. As Leonidas and his brave, but limited, band of Spartans take on the might of Xerxes at the Battle of Thermopylae, Athenian general Themistokles is waging war with the Persian navy, commanded by the ruthless Artemisia. The film makes big work of this rather thin plot, though, as it flashes back (and even flashes back inside a flashback) to show the lead up to the events of the film.While the film eventually does serve up plenty of what one would expect – grand, gory action scenes in extreme slow motion – the film more than disappoints with its writing. Despite having some terrific opportunities on the story level – like 300, this film is also based on a cult graphic novel by Frank Miller – the team of writers and director Noam Murro treat it in the most ham-handed manner. They quite clearly were just itching to get into the fight scenes, more than anything else.The film only briefly glances at the rise of Xerxes and how he came to be called a ‘God-King’, which is mentioned in 300. There was so much potential there, as well as in his complex relationship with Artemisia, that it almost seems like pity that so much screen time was wasted watching blood spurt in every conceivable direction.Even the story of Themistokles seems intriguing enough to warrant more meat in the screenplay. Apart from the fact that Sullivan Stapleton, who plays Themistokles, lacks true charisma, his story itself is glossed over, in favour of – you guessed it – slashing, slitting and piercing human flesh. Still, the film would have been far more fun if the action was at least of the quality of 300. However, that is quite not the case. Most of the film occurs at night, so the action scenes are too dark, and just not as eye-catching as what one would have expected. Add to that the 3D glasses, and you’re often straining to make out what is actually happening, even though you have the general idea that metal is making contact with body.Eve Green’s Artemisia, then, remains the most fun thing about 300: Rise of An Empire. She snarls, fights, smirks and oozes raw sexual energy that is never quite given free reign – except for one rather terrifying kiss – and most of its enigma lies in the way it is held back. The film itself ends on a note that quite surely suggests that a third film is on its way. A chance to make amends, for sure, but by the looks of it, expecting much would be pointless.

19,500 Days of Summer,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review2 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/500-days-summer-review/,,5/5.0,,4.3,"500 Days of Summer is a clever role reversal of the Adam-Eve chemistry and I was frankly surprised by how good the film turned out to be. Extremely inventive in its editing and story-telling, this film also boasts of a memorable soundtrack, right from its title credits to the closing ones. Call your date home, play this DVD, grab some popcorn, sit back and enjoy the movie. It’s a film worth revisiting again and again. Nominated at the 2009 Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.","500 Days of Summer must be the most circulated / rented DVD amongst the Siddharth Anand, Punit Malhotra, Karan Johar types. It’s a very obvious film to remake for Indian audiences - probably starring Imran Khan. The rom-com colours, quirky screenplay, crisp editing, non-linear story-telling and ability to laugh at itself, does a very neat invertendo of the Adam and Eve romance.Unlike the cliches cast in stone by Pyar Ke Side Effects, in this film, it is Eve who is commitment phobic, wants a relationship that is casual and relaxed, whereas Adam is emotional and wants something long term. He is the one who asks the question that guys are so scared of: “So where do you think this is headed?” or “Are we a couple?”On DVD, 500 Days of Summer is a breezy, often humorous and sometimes introspective film to sit through - almost perfect if you’re calling your date home. Right from the casting, apt for puppy love - Joseph Gordon Levitt (Tom) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel), to the picture post-card cinematography, to the odd Farah Khan-esque choreographed number (All I want is you), to the other lilting melodies in the soundtrack, to the inventive interception of the voice-over that navigates so effortlessly between the past and present, this film is right up there on the freshness quotient.Director Marc Webb, who is helming the next instalment of Spiderman, has interpreted the script well. After a long time, here is a story about love (not a love story, mind you) that makes you think about reversal of roles.How would it be if we boys became a cling-on, refusing to move-on, commitment-desirable types and the girls wanted nothing serious, very casual and use-and-throw relationships? That’s like a Harry Met Sally,  upside down. Scary thought, if you ask me. The fact that Tom is the woman in the relationship is established by some fabulous touches. I felt really sad for him. A little heartbroken.Summer’s character is unique. Deschanel plays Summer to a T - she’s a little eccentric, flirtatious and her long casual gaze and dialogue delivery is the most unusual I’ve seen among actresses.I’d have loved it if the screenplay had added a stronger back-story for her - The explanation given was a little insufficient a reason to make her that way. Why hasn’t she felt love with men she’s been with before? What has made her immune to the most genuine, honest advances of a guy like Tom?The writers of the film don’t tell us this, but hint at possible answers. A message they strongly advocate in the film is that love may not be a real thing after all - it exists as a fantasy in our minds and our expectations from love are only fuelled by pop-songs, movies and the romances we read about.The DVD is a bit of a disappointment in terms of Bonus Features - there are just some extended / deleted scenes, but they really don’t work their charms like some behind-the-scenes footage would have. Webb’s direction managed to immerse me in the lives of the characters, and some interviews with the cast would have been refreshing. Sadly there’s none nor any dope on the making of the film.The film has ‘feel-good’ written all over it - the songs are a big help - and I’d certainly classify it as a recommended viewing.

20,7 Aum Arivu,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 3/5.0 35 Tweet Reviews 3.7/5.0,/movie/7-aum-arivu-review/,,3/5.0,3.7/5.0,3.5,"7 Aum Arivu has an interesting concept, one never attempted before in India. Surya and Shruti Haasan are charming and likeable, and the opening of the film, set in the past, is well produced and shot. However, once the film shifts to the present, the writing is plain abysmal. So, in spite of having a lot of things going for it, the film ultimately settles into be being just below average.  Murugadoss deserves points for choosing an interesting premise, but seriously needs to hone his writing skills.","The opening 20 minutes of Ghajini-director A. R. Murugadoss’s latest offering, the Surya-starrer 7 aum Arivu, made me smile like few other films in the recent past have.Set just centuries after Christ in ancient India and China, the film opens almost like a documentary on the origins of the Shaolin clan. Ravi K. Chandran’s cinematography in these portions can only be described as stunning. Every grain on the surface of the film stock used seemed to have been milked for whatever it was worth, to produce some exquisite shots, used primarily in montage. How much of it was actually post-production would make an interesting topic for a debate though.With the arresting visuals, impressive production and VFX, and a unique concept with roots in history, the opening reels of the film laid a promising foundation for a smart, action-packed sci-fi thriller. Thereafter, however, the film nosedives into mediocrity like Ra.One’s second week box-office collections.Still, I couldn’t shake the first twenty minutes of the film from my head even hours after the screening. That the Tamil film industry is technically at par with and organizationally miles ahead of its Hindi counterpart is no secret. But I couldn’t stop wondering that if the diminutive, almost inconsequential looking Murugadoss could have the vision to execute what I saw in the initial reels of 7 Aum Arivu, what stops the Hindi film industry from doing the same? Once the film shifts to the present, it begins to meander around pointless songs, embarrasses the scientific community with hare-brained theories about genetic engineering and descends into near-right wing Tamil pride preachiness. Along the way, it also finds time to have Chinese people speak English in an accent that would make people believe that the ‘Britishers’ in Sanjay Khan’s Tipu Sultan were actually from Britain.If there is anything that all that marginally redeems the film in its entirety, it is Surya. He exudes a charm and genuineness that many Indian viewers are not used to seeing. Add to this the fact that he dances like a dream and is supremely confident doing any kind of action. Surya is, quite simply, a star. Surprisingly, even Shruti Haasan is a revelation in this film. She looks ethereal in Indian clothes, is extremely camera friendly, and seems to have had absolutely no problem dubbing for herself in Tamil. 7 Aum Arivu will go a long way in erasing memories of her in that disaster named Luck. The man playing Dong Lee, the Chinese villain, also does his bit. He is expectedly good in action and looks menacing enough. Which brings us back to the basic problem plaguing this, and indeed most films today – the writing. Mediocre at best and downright shoddy at its worst, some of the dialogues are just cringe-worthy. I fail to understand why week after week, audiences get to witness films that could have been, but are not.  While Murugadoss needs to be lauded for selecting such a new subject for a film, his treatment of it needs serious criticism. Understandably, he had to make the film palatable to primarily the Tamil audience. How one wishes though, that commercial pressures would not figure so highly on the list of priorities for Indian filmmakers.All said and done, I walked away from the cinema hall feeling a tad bit impressed. While they don’t venture too deep into cinematic waters, Tamil filmmakers like Murugadoss and Shankar (Endhiran, Sivaji – The Boss) show hints of a vision that Hindi cinema seems to sorely lack. 7 Aum Arivu, though an overall letdown, is not a complete waste of your time primarily because of this vision.

The rest of the lead cast is only a bonus. Now how I wish, there was a little bit of a surprise in the narration or at least I understood even half of why the characters behaved the way they did. Now if the only explanation is weird attracts weird and together they all get weirder, either I didn't get the film or it is one zany experience  that didn't go down all that well with me. And yet I wouldn't have wanted to miss watching this one.","I'm still digesting 7 Khoon Maaf. Bit-by-bit it’s sinking in. Though I cannot say that I like it any better or worse, but the more I think about it, I certainly understand it that bit more. I'm sure my grasp of the film will only improve with a second or even third viewing. But, I don't think I can make myself watch it again for it's a tedious watch. The narrative is way too plain and predictable to hold my interest. This is largely made-up for by enigmatic Susanna, who is played out, breathtakingly by Priyanka Chopra. One of the main thoughts and images the film leaves behind is, the mystery that Susanna is. She scares you, but at the same time, she doesn't let you forget that your heart went out for her warmth, just an hour ago. You wanted to protect her, you still want to figure her out, you desperately look for her motivations that justify her whacky behavior - just so that you can continue liking her. Only to be greeted by a development that is crazier than anything you've seen thus far. The problem though is that you know how each of the episodes, each of her marriages is going to end. Of course, 7 Khoon Maaf is not meant to be a thriller. But, nothing is gripping about how or why the husband dies. And after the second one, the reason for marrying itself is dissatisfying. You begin to doubt if she did it just so that she could enjoy the how it would end. shudder Anyway, one of the culprits could also be the straightforward, linear narration. Also, way too often, the build-up falls flat. Now, given Vishal Bharadwaj's command over adapting novels to  films, I'll assume that the story itself didn't quite work for me. Reading Ruskin Bond's Susanna's Seven Husbands is on my to-do list now, just for a confirmation. It just wasn't detailed enough. For example, the side characters (Maggie, Khan, and Gunga) seem out-of-sync with the plot but their quirkiness has to be a part of the story. Not to mention that the performances (Usha Utthup, and two male leads (names, anyone?)) are extremely distracting too. I understand that Susanna and each of her husbands are eccentric too and thus quirky side-characters can find a home in their midst. But, the lack of rationale behind the three side-kicks' enthusiastic loyalty is confusing, if not disturbing. Fortunately, the rest of the performances are perfect. Also, there are some very powerful sequences. The manner in which Musafir's (Irrfan Khan's) idiosyncrasy is shot and executed, sticks way past the two and a half hours spent watching the film. The nervous laughter in the theater is a giveaway that Hindi film audience is not comfortable watching sexuality on screen. Not that our filmmakers have been too good sexual scenes either. And both filmmakers and the audience know the others' shortcoming. With this background, to not only show, but to also explicitly explain Musafir's need is as stunning as it is brave. And once you have overcome the shock, you are completely pulled into that chapter of the Susanna's life. Knowing for a fact that Vishal Bharadwaj films have something going on beyond the superficial, I tried to dig deeper. There's of course, the riddle that Susanna is and you can identify with her deterioration as a person. But save the fleeting references to the socio-political events and the climax, nothing looked like it had a larger purpose. Besides serving as a timeline, the events mentioned in the film might indicate our apathy to the society we live in. Which is why maybe Arun's wife (Konkona Sen Sharma) is hardly moved by Susanna's acts. To her it is just a fun story, till she gets affected by it personally. The climax and what it implies is sophisticated but is by no means a breath-stopper. Our Susanna has come of age but how she got there was too hard to comprehend.If you haven't figured it out yet, 7 Khoon Maaf is one of those films that I didn't enjoy watching at all, but it still leaves a good aftertaste. A film that I didn't like watching, but I liked. Yep, I'm still figuring it out. All I know right now, is this - it is heavy, weird and dark; as a breather it has awesome performances; AND it is a very difficult film to recommend.

Also, the peak of suspense comes a bit too late.","Nope. There's no hope of anything to do with Akshay Kumar ever being unglamorous or non-stylized. If Nagesh Kukunoor can't do it, no one can. Given that 8 x 10 Tasveer is a thriller, maybe the whole super-heroic personality accorded to the main lead is very intentional. But, it borders disbelief so closely that the film feels more like comedy and doesn't strike awe at all. And I'm not yet talking of the superpowers he has. That Jai (Akshay Kumar) can look into the past has to be accepted as an assumption. The weird mumbo-jumbo provided as explanation is only to be ignored. Once you do that, it's an interesting concept and opens a world of opportunities. Nagesh's use of his protagonist's ability gives the regular ""who dunnit"" a very nice flavor. Jai realizes things bit by bit and with him the audience becomes aware of what had happened. This slow unfolding adds to the curiosity. And yet somehow there's no connection between Jai and me as an audience. There's a distance which stays through the movie and doesn't let me get too involved. I blame the over-dramatization for that. Either the hero or the villain resurrecting like he is The Terminator is just too 80-90ish for me and thus exasperating.  ""Die already"" you feel like yelling from the audience. This reminds me of the ""fall already"" that a viewer actually yelled in the theater at the never-ending, pointless jump that Jai makes in one of the early sequences. Had the whole theater laughing! The script does a good job of pointing a finger at all involved. Just like a person looking for an answer would suspect every one around him. But my problem with such mysteries is that the foreshadowing is more an attempt to confuse than to give a tiny bit away. Deleting elements from a scene and then later showing that element is no way of saying, ""caught you!"" It's cheating. Twists are awesome and I love it when they catch me unaware. But some of the twists here either come a tad too late and you can pre-empt them. Or they are almost out of the blue and a little too difficult to digest. Another thing that annoys me is the villain spelling everything out to the hero and thus to the audience. There surely must be a better way to go about this. Even if you discount for the fact that action films don't necessarily need a whole deal of acting, most of the performances are wooden. Especially Girish Karnad - there was a sizable amount of guffawing at his dialogue delivery. While Akshay Kumar does his usual bit, Ayesha Takia is just about tolerable. What's happening to this woman who was so impressive just two years ago. Javed Jafferi on the other hand brought a smile if not laughter with every movement - this time very intentional. By the way, I shudder to think what Nagesh will do if he ever has a full blown bedroom scene in his script. Just a hug comes out as heavily awkward. Or was Sharmila Tagore strutting around with the censor scissors on set? Drop the baggage associated with a Nagesh Kukunoor film. He seems to be struggling to strike a balance between his sensibilities and those of mainstream cinema. Don't worry, the stylish titles will help you along - they are really slick but so not what you associate with the Kukunoor name. Maybe he's trying to say, ""I can make such films too!"" Also, keep the Akshay Kumar 'star' style tag on sans the loudness - thankfully! And then you might give yourself a good chance to enjoy this.

23,99,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma reviewNotepad28 Critic Reviews 4.4/5.0 2 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/99-review/,4.4/5.0,5/5.0,,4.1,"A match-winner only if the runs didn't dry up in bits and parts. The climax however, is tied up pretty well and that's what sets it apart from other comedy films. The wit and silliness keep the flow of chuckles running through.","Dhak-a-chik-rap-a-chik-dhak-a-chik-dhakAbsolutely had to let you know how excited I am about Hindi movies being back in the theaters!!! And another... Dhak-a-chik-rap-a-chik-dhak-a-chik-dhak...because it was a pretty good restart. Nothing beats a few good hearty laughs. And this was pleasantly surprising too, considering the promos made it look like a slapstick affair. To start with, the color palette used sets it apart from the otherwise unnaturally bright comedies. Then the background music is very well done too and not loud at all. And these things were good enough to make-up for Kunal Khemu's non-voiceover voice and the lousy chase scene. I was almost sure these things would change for the worse after the titles, but the titles themselves were pretty creative and adorable. And the story line started getting interesting too.It ain't all rosy, though. The romantic bits drag a fair deal and a few lines intended to be funny fall flat. But most of the silly bits are giggle-worthy and some of the lines are actually witty or insightful or both. It helps that Cyrus Broacha is kept in tight rein - we are not subjected to his toilet-sexual-humor and he is not allowed to get loud. Kunal Khemu also doesn't annoy as much and goes through his functions without deserving either claps or slaps. This is an obvious cakewalk for Boman Irani. I absolutely enjoyed Amit Mistry's comic timing. Oh yeah, there's Soha Ali Khan too, the functional eye-candy.With all these positives and negatives delicately balanced, the final tilt towards the positive is most certainly the climax. Everything is neatly tied up in a quick wrap-up, and yet it doesn't feel like it came too soon. Also it maintains the tone of the film and there aren't any character transformations which make you go ""yeah, right!""Interestingly, the characters don't have any qualms cheating and are unabashedly aspiring for the big buck. They are all similar in their traits and goals, and they are all pretty much flat. Except for a lesson or two learnt most of them start and end at pretty much the same place. Yet it doesn't get boring because each one is a different shade of grey. I am thrilled with the way the fresh inflow of films has begun. A nice, light-weight, witty entertainer.

24,A Death in the Gunj,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/death-gunj-review/,,,,4.1,Konkona Sensharma's craft seems so heavily influenced by Aparna Sen's that this might as well be her mother's earlier film.,"One cannot help but notice how the directorial debuts of both Aparna Sen and Konkona Sensharma demonstrate an affinity towards the remnants of Anglo-Indian life and culture in post-colonial times. The setting of Aparna Sen's 36, Chowringhee Lane (1981) is Calcutta in the early eighties, where an old and lonely Anglo-Indian woman copes with changing times and declining relationships. The backdrop of A Death in the Gunj (2016) is McCluskiegunj, a (real) place in erstwhile Bihar. Gunj, as it is referred to in the film's title, was once a home to 300 Anglo-Indian families, most of who left India after World War II. If Wikipedia is to be believed, descendants of only twenty families still 'remain' in this quaint little idyllic habitat.It is December 1978 and McCluskiegunj is rustic, unkempt and decaying. The ground is covered with dried leaves. The sky is murky. The daylight is pale. Amidst this ambiance stands an isolated colonial bungalow owned by the Sharmas (played by the charismatic Om Puri and Tanuja). Surrounded by layers of foliage, the Sharma abode is replete with an outhouse, sprawling back and front yards, a couple of verandahs, a fireplace, and many twin-shuttered creaking doors and glass windows. Its teak furniture complements the ceramic, glass and steel cutlery. A washed-out checkered table cloth is spread in between the two, to set them apart. Lit only by dappled sunlight, the rooms might feel a little damp during the day. At night, they glow in tungsten light, while the surroundings remain shrouded in the dark. The spooky setting brings about a sense of foreboding, which the characters only intensify with their youthful but mischievous antics.At this time i.e. in the December of 1978, the house is crowded with Sharmas' guests -- their children (a young couple with a daughter) and extended family (a nephew, and children's common friends). All adults. Their interpersonal dynamics is unraveled slowly, through playful interactions -- banter and practical jokes, picnics, and lunches, all of which suggest a shared childhood and deep familiarity with each other. The cinematographer has washed the setting and characters in faint light, thus creating low-contrast visuals, which you will take a while to get used to. But once you do, McCluskiegunj may feel like home. Or at least reminiscent of one. That's the kind of old-world charm it creates. So much so that the place and atmosphere stay in memory longer than the story or the characters.For me, neither the story, nor the characters create an impact. The characters seem stereotyped. A macho guy, a damsel, a weakling, a bullish elder cousin, a caring maasi, and some more. Kudos to the actors who have embodied them and have played out the quirks as if they were their own. However, in spite of that and even though the focus is largely on character interactions, the costumes, and accessories, facial hair and wigs, sometimes drew too much attention. One cannot help but notice how well or not well is a particular actor carrying the period get-up. Then, the language – part Bangla, part English that the characters speak, I just couldn't relate to it. It could very well have been entirely in Bengali or in English, but combining both seemed like a feeble effort in capturing the regionality. It felt that not just the film’s setting but the very sensibility informing the film belongs to yesteryears. Of late, achieving a regional flavor by embracing the local dialect has become the mainstay of our films, and many recent films prove it, e.g. Gangs of Wasseypur, Nil Battey Sannata, Haramkhor, Dangal, etc.The bilingual aspect is also very reminiscent of Aparna Sen's English films. Add to it the grammar of slow unraveling plot, gradual, even if, minuscule increase in tension, and a strongly contrasting peak, almost as if a pebble was thrown in a placid lake, whose waters had only known the ripples caused by the summer breeze, the similarities with Aparna Sen's storytelling increase. All this makes Konkona Sensharma's craft seem so heavily influenced by Aparna Sen's that this might as well be her mother's earlier film, that too sans a tight emotional grip.From Konkona, I was hoping for a cinematic language that was more outgoing, maybe experimental, but not necessarily confined to the safe zone of constructed realism. Maybe bold, just like the roles she has played. Maybe more ordinary, but more real. But definitely, one that reflected her knowledge of a wider variety of cinema. I also hoped for a story that resonated with current times, something more topical, something that speaks of how she sees the world around her. But then, I also know that if she had done any of these, and had she failed to engross the audience, the critics would have gone after her for not doing justice to the legacy she carries.Maybe, her future films will carry a sensibility that is neither Sen nor Sharma, only Konkana. For now, what we have got is just old scotch in a new bottle, which is obviously not meant for an audience looking for instant gratification. It takes the time to grow on you. It asks you to sit and watch its effects unfold on you, mulling over with every sip. If this kind of cinema interests you, watch it in theaters. Otherwise wait for its Amazon Prime release, which happens to be its official streaming partner.

A film that will get “well-intended, heart in the right place” nominations. ","A Flying Jatt takes the good vs. evil theme a bit too seriously. Sure, you can't expect anything less from a superhero film. But, A Flying Jatt takes every opportunity it gets to hammer a message down. I don't know what is worse – that it does so, or that it does so after avoiding it for the first half. The first half treats the audience with some respect, allowing them to figure at least some stuff out by themselves. Post-interval it feels like the writers get the jitters and don't want to leave anything to chance. They quite literally spell out every thing. Like the film's metaphors for good and evil are clearly defined, to such an extent that they aren't representations any more. In fact, it is stretched out a bit too far.The story book + fairy tale kind of narration makes you wonder if A Flying Jatt would have worked as a kids' film? Nope. One because it isn't marketed as such. Two, because the urban kids are just exposed to a lot better – in terms of story, action and performances. I won't even bring up the CGI, etc.The movie even tries its hand at humor. It goes into spoof mode for a bit. However, the joke either falls flat because it goes on for too long  or it ends up being slapsticky. And of course, Amrita Singh and Jacqueline Fernandez screaming and squeaking respectively, can hardly be called humor. Tiger Shroff stumbling and stuttering as he plays a martial arts teacher can make you smile only so much. By the way, here's a quiz question – in which movie does Tiger Shroff play a character that doesn't require him to be a muscular guy who can do stunts, if not a martial artist? Hint: Trick question.Jacqueline Fernandez' character, Kirti just makes it a point to highlight how pointless she is. Even Amrita Singh's character seems like a placeholder for strong women, as if to check the “feminism” box. Oh, and it hurt to see Kay Kay Menon reduced to a caricatured villain. Yet again.Sure, A Flying Jatt has good intentions. But the moment you go all, “holier than thou” with speeches and history lessons, the cause is lost. The analogy of today's super-heros and villains was one thing that could have worked in favor of A Flying Jatt. Alas.

But, put together it becomes just about average.","For a film that starts with slapsticky toilet humor, A Gentleman recovers quickly with a couple good laughs, a tolerable-cute romance, and some slick action. Unfortunately, it goes back to regular action masala post-interval and loses the little charm it creates in the first hour. It was a pleasant surprise to see the writers tease the audience into saying “baah! predictable” and peek-a-booing a “gotchya!” There are some good action scenes too. I especially enjoyed the parking lot and shopping aisle scenes. There is a little honesty in the romance too. Interestingly, this romance felt relatively germane to the story compared to some of the cool stunts that were for the sake of cool action. After a bit, it truly became fitting in fights because they made the film look slick rather than being an integral part of the story.The story itself was weaved together in a very 90s-like fashion where all elements of entertainment are put together – comedy, romance, action – with each of these doing their bit in keeping you engaged. But, as a whole it loses steam. Interestingly again, a film full of any of these elements wouldn't have worked together either. They were entertaining in that dosage only. Anything more and it would drag. That points to the inherent weakness of not being able to convert an interesting-sounding core idea into a full-fledged feature length film. If any of these departments were strong by themselves, one wouldn't need the other elements as fillers. And even so, for a film that wants to showcase it's action and masala, A Gentleman does relatively well with its attempt at story.             Siddharth Malhotra does reasonably well as both Gaurav and Rishi. He has his own style of merging with his surrounding, whethere it is a dreary office meeting or a covert spy operation. This unfortunately, could also mean that if he doesn't evolve, he will loose screen presence. To elaborate, in the scenes with Jacqueline Fernandez, or for that matter even Hussain Dalal, they own the screen. And while Dalal is doing a good job of keeping a smile on your face, Fernandez isn't even trying too hard. Her diction reminded me of dubbed English films. You cringe at her dialogue delivery just like you'd cringe when you hear Matthew McConaughey speaking in Hindi. It is sad that she is still taking on these roles whereas almost every actress of her stature is doing at least some films that don't use women as pretty props. Instead she picks a role that is as redundant as a woman in many a Hollywood action film.Well, at least they picked and executed the action pieces well. If only, only they were enough to recommend a trip to the theaters for you. In that sense, it is a step down for this writer-directer duo.

27,A Good Day to Die Hard,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/good-day-to-die-hard-review/,,5/5.0,,3.466666667,"Bruce Willis is back with the fifth Die Hard film, A Good Day to Die Hard. This latest film, however, isn’t even as much fun as the previous one (which itself was merely passable), let alone the original or the two quite watchable films that came after it. Packed with more unnecessary action than one would care for, even Bruce Willis’ trademark punchline (you know which!) has never been used as poorly as it has been here. Safe to avoid this film altogether and do a marathon of the first three in the series on home video. ","Those who’ve watched Zero Dark Thirty or Homeland will be familiar with a torture technique that involves not letting captive prisoners sleep by playing loud, noisy music and shining bright lights on them at all times. I’d only be slightly exaggerating if I said that they could just have put them in a theatre playing A Good Day to Die Hard instead.Nearly a quarter of a century after Bruce Willis’ John McClane first scorched the big screen with unflinching, deadpan badass-ery, the aged but still cheerful action superstar returns in the fifth installment of the series; one that should have ended with the previous film. Directed by John Moore, the film is set in Russia this time, where John McClane has come in pursuit of his estranged son who is in the custody of the authorities there. However, he quite soon discovers that his son isn’t your usual vagabond imprisoned by the Commies – about then, I think that there might just be a feeble attempt at a story. All hopes of that evaporate soon after, however, as the Father-Son McClane duo spend the rest of their screen time bringing Russia to rubble all by themselves, with the customary few scratches to their own bodies. Loosely put, Taken with a yippee-ki-yay touch, with a pointless background story of what seems like a domestic quarrel between rich and powerful Russian men.If the sorry excuse for a plot makes you grimace, the execution of the film is nothing less than an assault on the senses. Humans, vehicles, buildings and even public infrastructure are treated with the same amount of disdain by the trigger-happy McClanes, who don’t for a second seem to think discretion is an option. After all, why waste time thinking, when you can blow something up? 
Admittedly, the high-octane camera work had me for about the first 20 minutes, before I realized that the octane level didn’t ever intend to dip. After that, it was all about trying to out-think the writer and director in terms of how ludicrous they could get. What is good to see though is that Bruce Willis hasn’t gotten over his penchant for having fun while the world is crumbling around him, with or without his interference. He adds a cutesy comic touch to John McClane’s paternal instincts, as he straddles the line between being a father looking out for his son and being the original bad guy hunter. Jai Courtney, who plays McClane’s son Jack, hasn’t a friction of the screen presence or likeability of Willis. He is bland with emotion as well as humour, which makes the father-and-son reconciliation aspect of the film seem like a bit of a joke. A Good Day To Die Hard is a tedious watch, because the film never eases up on the action, fully testing the limits of your suspension of disbelief. If there is anything good about the film at all, it is that it may make fans of the original films go back and revisit them, just for some good old-fashioned action fun. The only people who might find the film watchable are those who are absolute hard-core and exclusive action film fans, but for whom Chulbul Pandey is a bit too low-brow.

28,A Lot Like Love,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/lot-love-review/,,5/5.0,,3.466666667,"A Lot Like Love is a movie you need to see on a day when your only agenda is to sit inside a blanket all day with easy food (read: junk) and you definitely don’t want company. It’s an easy, smooth film that will lift your senses and stay with you for a while after you’ve watched it. Thankfully, you will not have to leave your brains anywhere. ","Have you noticed the rising background music that almost every rom-com plays in the climax? It’s a predictable pattern – rising piano melodies and beats, a raging one-liner, which changes the course of the film, “You had me at hello” (Jerry McGuire) or “It was magic” (Sleepless in Seattle). Following which, the music stops, for the ground breaking 30 seconds of revelation. And then the pair kiss; over a slow sax playing in the background. Even though we love seeing our familiar faces – Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant, and Richard Gere – do the romance ritual, we could each write a thesis on it.A Lot Like Love, too, is predictable, but only the kind that you like to relish on a love-starved day. It’s a story of two stark opposites (predictability no. 1) Amanda Peet and Ashton Kutcher, who meet on a flight while still in college. Sparks fly, (no 2) but with one slight variation. Peet is looking for some airplane-washroom-action, while Kutcher seems love struck. They find excuses to keep in touch and this sparks off a series of meeting over 10 years. They grow up, but not with each other – and in each phase, they manage to run into each other. The fun bit of the film is that every chance meeting isn’t predictable; the lead actors have a crackling chemistry and the soundtrack is extremely sensual, funny and passionate - very much in sync with the film. A Lot Like Loveis fresh, because it doesn’t need to rely on stereotypes to reveal a growing bond between the lead pair. With each chance meeting, year after year, the chemistry/repressed emotions get more and more palpable. Much like the rising piano melodies that are intrinsic to a climax of a rom-com, A Lot Like Love’s script (written by Colin Patrick Lynch) rises with every plot point, to a predictable climax, you want the movie to move in a pace where you can absorb every moment of growing passion.The DVD, released by Bueno Vista Home Entertainment, has a couple of negligible bonus features – an audio track by director Nigel Cole, deleted scenes and blooper reel that is very hilarious courtesy Ashton Kutcher and a music video of Aqualung’s 'Brighter Than Sunshine', possibly the best song on the soundtrack.We all like to be intellectually stimulated, but there’s a different joy in reaching out to a more expressive side within you, that likes the regular dose of mush. Unlike typical romantic movies, A Lot Like Love is a crisp, fresh and well-paced love story of two very lovable characters. It’s A Lot Like Love, not all love. It’s partly wit, partly humour and lots of smile-worthy moments!

29,A Mighty Heart,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review2 Reader Reviews 1/5.0,/movie/a-mighty-heart-review/,,1/5.0,,2.133333333,,"Based on Marianne Pearl’s book of the same name, A Mighty Heart focuses on the events surrounding the immediate aftermath of the kidnapping of Pearl’s husband, fellow-journalist and Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl (played by Dan Futterman).When he went missing, Daniel was in Karachi – where most of the film is set – to investigate extremist links to British national Richard Reid, the infamous failed ‘shoe bomber’, jihadist and Guantanamo detainee. The film essentially documents the combined attempts of the Pakistani security forces, US intelligence services, Daniel’s colleagues and Marianne herself to find Daniel and has captors.Marianne (played by Angelina Jolie) is unwilling to be a victim of circumstance: she is proactive, passionate and fiery as she attempts to unravel the tangled web of contacts, fixers and middlemen in the quest to locate her husband.Director Michael Winterbottom faces a challenge, which he deals with admirably: to combine both reconstruction and dramatisation. For the former, Winterbottom uses several techniques giving the film a ‘fly on the wall’ documentary quality, such as heavy use of handheld camera shots, along with datelines and interspersed contemporary news footage. For the latter, he keeps up the tempo through the editing – quick cuts between shots, jump cuts and pacy visuals. The combination of documentary style visuals and action thriller pacing is definitely in vogue right now – The Bourne Ultimatum stands as a prime example.Anurag Kashyap also had a crack with Black Friday, but A Mighty Heart succeeds where Black Friday ultimately failed. Whereas many of the sequences in Black Friday would have worked as dramatisations within a documentary, as a film it fell down because of the lack of genuine characterisation or cohesive narrative.A Mighty Heart manages to pull this off. This is definitely Marianne’s story – not Daniel’s – and we’re firmly placed in her shoes throughout. Winterbottom resists the temptation either to dramatise or speculate about Daniel Pearl’s incarceration itself. Following Daniel’s disappearance, the emphasis is firmly on Marianne’s desperate search, and we see him only in flashbacks or photographs. Just like Marianne, we have to learn the truth piece by piece as the story unfolds.As with Black Friday and Steven Spielberg’s Munich, A Mighty Heart avoids over-simplistic cartoonish characterisations of the ‘bad guys’. This adds to the realism; even jihadists have families too.Much has been said about Jolie’s portrayal of Marianne. Is she the right actress for the part? To be fair, Jolie deserves credit for her performance. She puts in a strong emotional turn in an undoubtedly challenging role, and is certainly less irritating than usual. Without her influence (and that of her husband, co-producer Brad Pitt) it’s unlikely that the film would have been made in the first place.Although Jolie is the star name, the film benefits from balanced and understated performances from across the cast. In particular, the ever-reliable Irrfan Khan is excellent as Captain, the Pakistani CID officer leading the investigation. Futterman has relatively little screen time, but convinces, as does Archie Panjabi as Marianne’s friend and hostess Asra – who as an Indian in Pakistan faces problems of her own.Winterbottom occasionally lapses into cliché – is it possible to signify a new day in Pakistan without panning across a hazy dawn skyline accompanied by the cry of the muezzin? It seems not. As soon as we leave the haven of Asra’s lavish Karachi bungalow we’re pitched immediately into the apparent chaos of downtown Karachi. Yet while Karachi’s traffic might seem threatening to many – and is presumably used as a device to unsettle the audience – it would not faze Daniel Pearl, an experienced journalist who lived and worked in Bombay.As an adaptation of a non-fiction book, A Mighty Heart may not have the luxury of a conventional plot. However, the film demonstrates that with care and attention to detail it is possible to produce an intelligent, thought-provoking dramatisation without resorting to sensationalist flourishes. Fittingly, like Marianne and Daniel, A Mighty Heart has dignity.

The film essentially documents the combined attempts of the Pakistani security forces, US intelligence services, Daniel’s colleagues and Marianne herself to find Daniel and has captors.Marianne (played by Angelina Jolie) is unwilling to be a victim of circumstance: she is proactive, passionate and fiery as she attempts to unravel the tangled web of contacts, fixers and middlemen in the quest to locate her husband.Director Michael Winterbottom faces a challenge, which he deals with admirably: to combine both reconstruction and dramatisation. For the former, Winterbottom uses several techniques giving the film a ‘fly on the wall’ documentary quality, such as heavy use of handheld camera shots, along with datelines and interspersed contemporary news footage. For the latter, he keeps up the tempo through the editing – quick cuts between shots, jump cuts and pacy visuals. The combination of documentary style visuals and action thriller pacing is definitely in vogue right now – The Bourne Ultimatum stands as a prime example.Anurag Kashyap also had a crack with Black Friday, but A Mighty Heart succeeds where Black Friday ultimately failed. Whereas many of the sequences in Black Friday would have worked as dramatisations within a documentary, as a film it fell down because of the lack of genuine characterisation or cohesive narrative.A Mighty Heart manages to pull this off. This is definitely Marianne’s story – not Daniel’s – and we’re firmly placed in her shoes throughout. Winterbottom resists the temptation either to dramatise or speculate about Daniel Pearl’s incarceration itself. Following Daniel’s disappearance, the emphasis is firmly on Marianne’s desperate search, and we see him only in flashbacks or photographs. Just like Marianne, we have to learn the truth piece by piece as the story unfolds.As with Black Friday and Steven Spielberg’s Munich, A Mighty Heart avoids over-simplistic cartoonish characterisations of the ‘bad guys’. This adds to the realism; even jihadists have families too.Much has been said about Jolie’s portrayal of Marianne. Is she the right actress for the part? To be fair, Jolie deserves credit for her performance. She puts in a strong emotional turn in an undoubtedly challenging role, and is certainly less irritating than usual. Without her influence (and that of her husband, co-producer Brad Pitt) it’s unlikely that the film would have been made in the first place.Although Jolie is the star name, the film benefits from balanced and understated performances from across the cast. In particular, the ever-reliable Irrfan Khan is excellent as Captain, the Pakistani CID officer leading the investigation. Futterman has relatively little screen time, but convinces, as does Archie Panjabi as Marianne’s friend and hostess Asra – who as an Indian in Pakistan faces problems of her own.Winterbottom occasionally lapses into cliché – is it possible to signify a new day in Pakistan without panning across a hazy dawn skyline accompanied by the cry of the muezzin? It seems not. As soon as we leave the haven of Asra’s lavish Karachi bungalow we’re pitched immediately into the apparent chaos of downtown Karachi. Yet while Karachi’s traffic might seem threatening to many – and is presumably used as a device to unsettle the audience – it would not faze Daniel Pearl, an experienced journalist who lived and worked in Bombay.As an adaptation of a non-fiction book, A Mighty Heart may not have the luxury of a conventional plot. However, the film demonstrates that with care and attention to detail it is possible to produce an intelligent, thought-provoking dramatisation without resorting to sensationalist flourishes. Fittingly, like Marianne and Daniel, A Mighty Heart has dignity.

31,A Walk Among the Tombstones,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/walk-among-tombstones-review/,,3/5.0,,3.1,"Despite its sober pace, A Walk Among the Tombstones is that rare film which manages to transport you into the world it is set in. Written for the screen and directed by Scott Frank, the film also has the added benefit of having Liam Neeson play a character you don’t expect so much from him. ","Though far from perfect, writer-director Scott Frank’s A Walk Among the Tombstones, adapted from a Lawrence Block novel of the same name, comes across as a refreshing change. Perhaps it was the sight of Liam Neeson in the publicity material that caused one to fear that the film would once again have Neeson play what he’s been doing so frequently in the recent past. Thankfully enough, his character as well as the film itself are treated with rare patience.Set in the year 1999 (the period building up to the greatest of anti-climaxes, that Y2K non-event), Neeson plays Matt Scudder, a recovering alcoholic and retired (for a reason) NYPD cop who now takes up cases as a private investigator, even if he is an unlicensed one. A Walk Among the Tombstones has an intriguing air about it, all the way through. Aided greatly by Mihai Malaimare Jr. 's  cinematography, but propelled mostly by Scott Frank’s mature, stoic handling of the film, it is the atmosphere of the film that is its biggest strength. Reminiscent often of Denis Villeneuve’s Prisoners (though not nearly as haunting), the film unfolds at its own gentle pace. Apart from the mature treatment, the film also gives us a more real hero than we’ve come to expect from any Hollywood film lately, let alone one that has Liam Neeson in the lead. It is great to see him not effortlessly mowing down multiple baddies at one go, actually get beaten up a little bit himself, but still show the spirit to carry on. In one of the best scenes of the film, a man draws a knife on Scudder; the way the scene eventually plays out will surprise you, and it will underline why sometimes it makes so much sense to infuse realism into cinema.The film also gives us a pair of unlikely bad guys. David Harbour, who plays one of them, is terrific in particular. There is something chilling about the remorseless way in which they do what they do, though their background and motivations aren’t sufficiently explained. My other grouse with the film was the fact that the slow pace and spine-tingling ambiance all seemed to be building up to something that would grab at your gut, but that doesn’t quite happen. The film still will have your stomach in a knot for the most, but amping up the shock value somewhere would perhaps have served the film well.Then again, you realize that that never seemed to be the director’s intention in the first place. There’s a message or two in the film (through the character of Scudder himself, as well as his interactions with a homeless boy named T.J.); there’s a vacant, sepulchral feel that draws you in; and there’s a nice turn by a terrific actor playing a character truly worth rooting for. That was what Scott Frank always seemed to hold as his trump cards, and they’re what deliver a decent film - one that demands patience, yes, but which ultimately rewards you with that feeling of having inhabited a world outside of your own.

32,A Wednesday,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma reviewNotepad32 Critic Reviews 4.4/5.0 3 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/a-wednesday-review/,4.4/5.0,4/5.0,,3.866666667,An engrossing thriller with the most unlikely duo in the main lead - Anupam Kher and Naseeruddin Shah.,"A city under seize. 5 bombs threatening to go off. The administration, in turn, turning all its resources up-side-down. We've seen this and a lot more in Hollywood. But, when you take this basic plot, add some very basic action to it, cast the most wonderful cast you could have, you have me arrested - not wanting to blink once.I like to observe how the titles of a movie are done, because in a way, it’s a measure of how much respect the decision makers have for their crew. Many a time there's so much noise and glitter during the titles that you are forced to not read the opening credits. So, when half of A Wednesday's titles are plain white text on black background with zero sound, I am hooked. There's one scene where the person threatening to set-off bombs is very close to being caught. At that point, I was wondering how cool it'd be if he's actually caught at this point, wonder how the story will move on. And at the very same time, I was sincerely hoping that he escapes. Just in case, his capture would mean that the movie is close to its end. I hadn't even realized that it's not even interval yet, that's how much I was enjoying the thrill and the build-up.While introducing its characters to us, A Wednesday also takes digs at the influence of ""stars"" in our film industry, gender bias in our society, ""creation"" of news by our media, and the general attitude of our law and order officials. Along the way, it comments on the impotency of our law enforcement department (though, it was refreshing to see a room full of committed police officers). And as a final bang, very smartly, the plot uses the same impotency to make right right. Just less than 24 hours ago, I was applauding a director's effort to give Anupam Kher a non-loud, meaningful role. And here we have a movie which has him as the protagonist. Sure, it doesn't require him to go through the whole range of expressions an actor - particularly this one - is capable of. But what it gives him back is our - his audience's - respect. What can I say about Naseeruddin Shah - I was just left speechless by his character's confidence and angst, whether ill-placed or not. Even though, thrillers are not necessarily the best genre to display acting prowess. Anupam Kher and Jimmy Shergill are what I call the soft faces in the film fraternity. However, stern their characters, you expect them to soften up sooner or later. But they have such strong attitudes here, that when you see Anupam Kher and even Jimmy beat someone up, you don't question it. Both the writing and the performances complement each other. The smaller side characters also have their charm. Like, the young self-made hacker was cute. Yep! I actually found a geek adorable. Speaking of which, except for the amusing graphics on the screen, the other technical talk didn’t sound like mumbo-jumbo.The melodramatic background score used to create suspense and the overdramatic slo-mo stylization of Naseeruddin Shah's character are about the only things that irritated me. From the tone of the movie otherwise, especially the muted titles, I got the feel that this excessive drama was not based on creative decisions from the heart but the director resorted to them because he was supposed to. Surprisingly though, the speech in the climax didn't get tiringly preachy. That's mostly because the motivations sounded novel yet believable.Anupam Kher and Naseerudin Shah - truly a pleasure to see you on the screen together, sirs! That too in a thriller...

The story is just a functional wrap-around the makers' passion for dancing but the dances themselves are like those seen in reality shows.,"ABCD - Anybody Can Dance has Gopi (Ganesh Acharya) tease Vishnu (Prabhu Deva) ""You want to make a Lagaan?"", when Vishnu expresses that he'll train some good-for-nothings from a slum area compete in a TV dance show. Within context, it is funny. As the movie progresses you realize Remo D'Souza actually made Lagaan cum ChakDe! India cum 3 Idiots. Unfortunately, not in terms of quality of narrative, but only in terms of the themes touched upon. This when all he actually wanted for ABCD - Anybody Can Dance to do is express his love for dance. Also, if there are so many choreographers interested in making a film about dancing, why can't we have a full-blown musical?Unfortunately, the dances here come across as aerobic and gymnastic routines, with a little yoga thrown in. Except for the extravaganza in the end, it's a true spectacle. Isn't dance a lot more about grace than being able to contort your body into twists and turns. For the joy of watching dance, I'd happily watch Madhuri Dixit in all her elegance or Sri Devi mimic Michael Jackson, even if it's just for half a minute.Fortunately, on the other hand, I knew what to expect. So, if you are a fan of Prabhu Deva kind of dancing, you are in for a treat. Even if a lot of the sequences look like they might be inspired from something already done elsewhere. However, I would think to showcase actual talent in dancing, shouldn't there have been many more long shots? Sure, the final dance is spectacular, yet it is nowhere close to the one in F.A.L.T.U or that in Aaja Nachle. Also, F.A.L.T.U had much more of a story than ABCD - Anybody Can Dance. While the twists in the end added an element of surprise, they fail to tug your heart the way they could have. There is so much dance to be showcased that there is no room for the characters to build a connect with you. At least, not enough for you to go beyond the obvious good vs evil. Other than that too, there were a few things that I liked about ABCD's story - the tight slap between a father and his son, the fact that Vishny eventually has no love interests to distract us from the main story. But, the typical character turn-arounds in the end nullify the things going for ABCD.However, ABCD if taken as a display of current-day dancing, is quite enjoyable. If only, it stuck to its title. When you say Anybody Can Dance, I would have wanted people like me, who have two left feet and are extremely conscious about it, to dance. But, it's ultimately, people who can dance, can dance.

If you are looking for story, move on. ","For just a bit there I thought ABCD 2 is going to turn out to be a musical. As Varun Dhawan's character,  Suru wonderfully expresses his pain to his mother in a dance form. But nope. That excitement soon washed away as it becomes clear that movie is only and only about the dance competition. Haven't we had enough dance films with the same ol' underdog story? The worse bit is that the story has less and less meat with every film. With ABCD 2 though, at least there are quite a few hip hop dance sequences that look novel and catch your imagination and attention. In that context, if all you are looking for is hip hop dance, then you will be more than satiated. In almost every dance sequence there is one move that makes your jaw drop and wonder if it was real or some camera trickery. Beyond that though, the hip hop music itself seems repetitive. Also, while the dances that build up towards the climax have something or the other interesting about them, the climax itself is quite lame – both in terms of the dance sequence itself and the story. In fact, the final formation of the last dance came together clumsily and wasn't to the beat at all, and quite intentionally so. While this bothered me, its play in the story - which is of little consequence anyway – was even worse. The writing is neglected so bad that when there is no dance on screen, the scenes drag. And very little of that can be blamed on the actors. The performers are all in top form as far as the dancing goes. The hard work shows in their effortless dances. Fortunately or unfortunately, there isn't much of a demand from them in the acting department. With character sketches that look like they were written on the go, if at all. And a story that seems to be built because there was a sudden realisation that it didn't exist. But hey, ABCD 2 is blatant about how little it cares for the writing. And it's very clear about its passion for hip hop.  So, if you don't care about the story and are looking for groovy hip hop moves, ABCD 2 is just the right thing for you.

35,ARGO,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/argo-review/,,,,3.5,"Ben Affleck’s third feature, Argo, is based on real life events about a covert CIA operation in Iran in the 1980s. Affleck’s tight handling of the story, the convincing ensemble cast and a sense of humour ensure that this period thriller engages you from start to finish.","‘Truth is stranger than fiction’ is probably what the most creatively deficient of us would have to say about Argo. Ben Affleck’s third feature as director is based on real life events so extraordinary that had this story emerged directly from the imagination of a writer, audiences would have scoffed at how far-fetched it seems. In 1979, revolutionaries in Iran stormed the US embassy in protest of the US custody of religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini, a wanted man in Iran. As over 50 US citizens were held hostage, six of them managed to escape the embassy, seeking refuge at the residence of the Canadian Ambassador. Tony Mendez, a CIA ‘exfiltration’ specialist was then brought in to hatch a plan to pull out those six from Iran, because every Iranian revolutionary was baying for American blood. Right from the time the film rolls, what it manages to get dead right is the feel of it - the Warner Bros logo that appears is not the shield logo that we are now accustomed to, but the one used during the time period in which this film is set. From then on, the viewer is sucked in to the grainy, dated feel of the images, the clothes and look of the actors, little details like the dilapidated Hollywood Sign in an establishing shot of LA and of course, the urgency of the actual story being told. The brisk pace and gritty tone of the film combines with its audaciously thrilling plot to create one of the more entertaining thrillers seen this year. A film that, for the most, remains faithful to the serious story of American citizens treading the thin line between life and death, without losing its dry sense of humour and its quite simple agenda of engaging and entertaining. Affleck handles the film with the deft hand of a seasoned filmmaker. Don’t forget, this is the man who won his first Academy Award for co-writing Good Will Hunting at the age of 25. Structured and built like most thrillers are, Affleck manages to inject the right amount of tension at every step of the film. The result is that one can almost feel the entire cinema hall’s collective rising and falling anxiety as the plan slowly begins playing itself out. Alexandre Desplat’s music score plays its bit in adding to the tension.Affleck also directs the ensemble cast to perfection - Bryan Cranston as the CIA honcho handling the operation is excellent, even though the character itself isn’t something one hasn’t seen before. Victor Garber’s sheer presence seems to justify why he was cast as the Canadian Ambassador who willingly offers shelter to the American refugees. John Goodman and Alan Arkin are excellent as well. And even though one does see his regular twitches and sighs throughout the film, Affleck’s own performance as Tony Mendez hits all the right notes. He looks convincing as the committed, sincere ‘exfil spesh’ dealing with his own personal demons while handling one of the most important covert operations in the CIA’s history. Admittedly, the pace of the film does drop along the way, particularly when it often (albeit briefly) tends to drift into Tony Mendez’s personal back-story. The film also goes on a little longer than is necessary at the end. A few minutes shaved off here and there could really tighten the screws and possibly improved the overall experience of the film. Still, Argo is a film that I would highly recommend, even though there is a good chance that you’ll make a meal of your fingernails by the end of it.

36,Aa Dekhen Zara,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma reviewNotepadPreview24 Critic Reviews 2.5/5.0 4 Reader Reviews 2/5.0,/movie/aa-dekhen-zara-review/,2.5/5.0,2/5.0,,3.066666667,A smooth start with a rocky ending turns a romantic thriller into an unintentional comedy.,"The single most important thing for a thriller to work is a lack of loopholes. From a story that seems to be smart and appears to have it all sorted-out Aa Dekhen Zara becomes so full of holes that you have to sieve through them to reach the basic plot. At half-point you know you are not looking at some great work of art but you are looking forward to some quick-paced slick piece of thrill. And then you hear the cookie crumble, but you try to ignore it. ""It can't be that bad"" you say. And then you see it crumble and know that the damage is irreparable. The inevitable, irrelevant, sleazy dance begins. Some villainous looking men ask a sexy lady to dance and she obliges. Except that there is nothing fearsome about those guys. This one song is indescribably out-of-place not only situation-wise but also out-of-synch with the general tone of the movie. Not to mention that it's hilarious to see Neil Nitin Mukesh call Bipasha Basu gori (fair skinned). And yet before any of this comes along there are other things that are avoided that make the film a tad bit charming. With something as powerful as a piece of equipment that can make predictions, the protagonists don't aim at anything lofty or altruistic. So, you don't see the film taking its purpose too seriously. Unfortunately, it takes itself too lightly and the entire suspense, ""damn! What next?"" results in an anti-climatic molehill. Like most departments, the dialogues too are inconsistent. The occasionally witty lines dive into blech and float back to average. Thankfully though, Neil Nitin Mukesh's narration of his character, Ray's thoughts were not as annoying as such spoon-feeding can usually be. I really don't know how they managed that because Neil didn't really need to emote, his voiceover left no doubt about what he was thinking. That still doesn't mean that he didn't act well. There's something that his eyes do which could have conveyed the thought if they were allowed to. Bipasha Basu playing DJ, Simi...well, she does the little bit she can emote if the audience can be bothered to look above her neck. Hey! I'm not being voyeuristic, she was there for a purpose and I damn well appreciate it, right? Well, she does her usual excellent job of looking good. Other than that, her costumes looked like costumes and not dresses that a normal person would wear. The rest of the cast has done a hideously superficial job. Earlier in the movie though, I found myself enjoying the pace. It doesn't stop at anything or for anyone. Aa Dekhen Zara smoothly flows from one incident into another, especially in the beginning. I especially enjoyed the pace of the romance between Ray and Simi. In fact, I enjoyed a romantic moment in cinema after a long, long time. Later, like the rest of the movie, the even pace too becomes jerky because of the jumps it feels obligated to take. Oh, by the way, if you are looking to take away some cool action sequences at the very least - let me save you some time, money, and energy. There's none. Some light, nice build-up is what we have in the first half and a burst balloon in the second.

The wit is completely enjoyable and so are some of the performances. Padded with the usual spoof-material, only a little funnier.","A mega-bomb blast is hatched in the heart of Mumbai. There are jihadis involved. And such a serious issue is completely ripped apart with laughter from the audiences. That is exactly how lightly this unlikely subject of terrorism is dealt with in Aage Se Right. The title would be meaningless without its logo. A straight run into a no-entry lane is what this film is all about. To start off, there's a terrorist (Kay Kay Menon) and a cop (Shreyas Talpade) both of whom are the least suitable in their professions. It's a spoof from the first few sequences. You can sense something is off from the darkest possible ambience created in the first scene. My usual complaint with spoofs is that in the name of being satirical they tend to do the same things that they are spoofing, only more exaggeratedly. Both the writer and director refrain from doing that and that a HUGE bonus for the audience. Of course, they haven't been able to avoid it completely. To start with a few jokes are predictable. Then, stereotyping of people from various regions of the country has been done ad nauseam in Hindi films. There are coincidences that are not anywhere close to reality in Mumbai. Also, there's this film set whose crew is the most annoying. Add to this flashback, character transitions, token roles to women, some bad animation, and a clichéd climax - could be all in the name of satire, but it didn't entertain nor did it make a point. There's the customary joke on the targe of every third film these days - media - it receives another thrashing in the same old way. Enter creative dialogues. Aage Se Right has the most hilarious lines I've heard in a real long time. A couple of them made me burst out into laughter and the rest of the time I had a wide grin across my face. The situations added to the scope for dialogues. The entire idea of having a Mumbai underworld Don teach a pure Urdu speaker the Mumbaiya dialect of Hindi under the name of ""correct"" language was hilarious and didn't get tiring till the end. And add to this the little things happening in the ambience - sign boards, costumes, mobile phone ring tones colors used - all that contribute to the humorous vein. The contrast between rough and gruff Mumbaiya and the ultra-clean albeit outdated soft Urdu is unmistakable. The comparison of how the underworld organizes itself with that of the corporate world is comic. I also enjoyed the analogy of Dinkar Waghmare's (Shreyas Talpade's) character to superheroes. It's always fun to see Kay Kay Menon switch to comedy in an otherwise serious role. But in this one, he is a complete laugh riot. And that too completely utilizing his perfect diction. Can you miss the character's frame of mind with an actor like Kay Kay. Cool clown, Shreyas Talpade has timed his lines perfectly. Though the script requires him to be a little loud, he manages to annoy only when the co-character in the frame needs to be annoyed. The balancing might have been a tough one. A couple of other character actors have done well too, but the rest is just going through the drill.It's been a while since I've enjoyed a spoof so much. The constant stream of funny quips and Kay Kay Menon were the main contributors. It is a good weekend watch, not necessarily a rush to the theaters for the not so keen but certainly a cool DVD watch.

38,Aaja Nachle,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma reviewNotepad27 Critic Reviews 2.6/5.0 6 Reader Reviews 2/5.0,/movie/aaja-nachle-review/,2.6/5.0,2/5.0,,3.1,"Aaja Nachle is another ordinary story narrated pleasantly and in a digestible manner.  So, you know the end, but you wait for the next obstacle that the protagonist will face. The dialogues are a good spread between funny and casually profound. A good first half and the magnificent climax makes you forgive the multiple glitches in characterizations and a few in the script. There are only so many things you can do with a feel good movie.","I really like this trend of combining commercial cinema with believability. Where full advantage is taken of liberties given to the art form but yet no major leaps of faith are required. The one main thing the makers ask of you is a little benefit of doubt in character transformations towards the end. But by then you have enjoyed yourself enough to give it to them. It's a musical, so neither is great acting demanded nor is it delivered. Everybody has to do their bit without going over-the-top and that's what they stick to. It is very interesting and rather commendable that although Madhuri is the heart and soul of the movie, only once in a while do you realize that it is Madhuri you are watching and not Dia. The gripping script deserves as much credit as the woman herself. She is aging gracefully, and it's great that she is playing mother to a 10-12 year old and not posing as a college student. I am really glad they didn't work very hard on covering up the blemishes on her face. Makes her more earthly. Fortunately, the story is not just about her. And the movie is not just about her magical smile and wonderful eyes. Focus on just one character makes a movie very plain. Anyway, there is nothing very remarkable about her character.  Aaja Nachle is more a comment on the onslaught of commercialization. About how politicians and businessmen play together to achieve whatever fancies their whim. It is also an attempt to show how a new educated breed of politicians can use this power to make a difference if they will. And all of this is running in the background, so there is no preaching. All-in-all, pretty decent fare for a feel good movie. After a long while, a really long while, I was thinking, ""oh cool, it's not even interval yet"" instead of ""oh crap, it's not even interval yet."" The first half was very engrossing. And that the script was in the safe hands of Jaideep Sahni was a comforting thought during the interval. ""Even if it drops, it's not going to plummet to the bottom.""  And drop it does. The second half seemed rushed. The little nuances of characters that I admired in the beginning were all mish-mashed and lost by the end. But, the 20-minute grand finale in the form of a play makes up for all of that. What a spectacle! Yes, they don't let you forget you are watching a movie that has Yash Raj money pouring into it, and not a play. The edits, camera movements, art design all work towards that...and what a spectacle!! The lyrics, the music, the performances, the costumes, the colors, the choreography all make you wish that your eyes didn't need to blink. And that makes the extra half hour (over the standard two-hour length) acceptable. The audience in the theater was clapping after the play. It's almost as if the makers anticipated this and left a brilliantly timed pause at the end of the play.Is it only befitting that the who's who of the Indian ""parallel"" cinema is asked to sing and dance? Because the characters in the movie are also the most unlikely to dance. Who would have imagined Ranvir Shorey, Vinay Pathak, and Konkana Sen Sharma would all be part of a musical? Or is it just that the producer wanted to say, ""See, I made them dance too!"" I wonder.Is this becoming a formula at Yash Raj Films?

39,Aajacha Divas Majha,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review,/movie/aajacha-divas-majha-review/,,,,3.1,"Bindhaast and Tukaram director, Chandrakant Kulkarni’s latest film, Aajcha Divas Majha, is a well-acted but slightly silly political ‘dramedy’; one that is quite watchable and even fun at times, because of the on-screen tussle between Sachin Khedekar and Mahesh Manjrekar, but seldom rises above that. ","After his biopic on the Marathi poet-saint Sant Tukaram, director Chandrakant Kulkarni is back with something that is a little more up his alley. A dramatic, often humourous and slightly silly, take on the political and bureaucratic class of our country, and an attempt to show how sometimes all it takes is a strong will to get the most difficult of things done despite the heavily flawed system that we are a part of. Aajcha Divas Majha remains watchable primarily because of a strong anchor that is the character of the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, and the performance of Sachin Khedekar who is terrific in that role.Strong, upright, honest, slightly egotistical but also always conscientious, Vishwasrao Mohite is the current Chief Minister of Maharashtra; one who has fought off devious political manoeuvres, some from within his own party, to retain his post. Aajcha Divas Majha tells the story of one particular day in his life, when he decides to take on a system that he himself is right at the top of. Like all character-based and dialogue driven dramas, (particularly when it comes to Indian regional films), Aajcha Divas Majha, despite ranging from silly to far-fetched to downright implausible, is also nearly continuous, indulgent fun. The humour spans the gamut from loud to campy to sharp, but it perhaps was the only way this film could have been treated for it to hold the audience for so long. Underneath the silly humour, the film is also a commentary on the manner in which the first response to any request by our politicians and bureaucrats is, “No, it can’t be done,” followed by a long-drawn period of needless paperwork, followed by invariable nepotism, scams, corruption and the likes. My chief grouse with the film was the fact that every character in the film except for three - Chief Minister Vishwasrao Mohite, his PA, Shinde, and Mr. Rahimatpurkar, the top IAS official the CM takes on - seems to be a buffoon. Because of this, the silly humour that I mentioned earlier pervades the entire runtime of the film. Also, despite the film being well-intentioned, and the noble symbolism behind the cause that the CM takes up, the cause itself is quite absurd, and will often make you wonder about the rationale behind it. Needless to say, it is Sachin Khedekar who walks away with top honours from this film. What he manages to do, through his character, is show us the kind of leader we need in our country. True, his character has been written to be slightly populist; even honest and strong-willed politicians in real life will rarely ever take on the system the way he does in the film. But Khedekar makes us forget this for two-and-a-little hours of our lives. A far more real character, and almost equally well played by Mahesh Manjrekar, is that of IAS big shot, Rahimatpurkar. Representative of what ails our bureaucracy despite having a number of dynamic and intelligent people in it, he is the perfect foil to the idealism of CM Vishwasrao Mohite. Another character that wins your heart, albeit in a clearly manipulative manner, is that of Shinde, who plays the PA to the CM. Slightly reminiscent of the character of Paresh Rawal from Shankar’s ‘Nayak – The Real Hero’, he is caught between adhering to protocol, and going against the tide with the man who is his boss. Played quite well by Hrishikesh Joshi, who always has a pleasing presence anyway, he often makes you smile.A small word on the late Rajen Kothari, who was the cinematographer of this film. A man who shot so many films that have gone against the commercial norms of our film industry, his work in the film is good as usual, though I suspect that digital capture and projection didn’t do justice to it. His presence, of course, will sorely be missed in the industry.Aajcha Divas Majha isn’t a great film by any stretch of imagination. In fact, only the truly generous would go so far as to even call it a good film. What it does manage to do though, is rarely lose the attention of the audience because, let’s face it, we love seeing our political and bureaucratic class take each other on. It had the potential to be a seminal film on Indian politics, but never even goes close to fulfilling that potential. Still, it makes for a fun watch.

About a flaw in our society, but completely hidden in the midst of the action. All negatives are completely overshadowed by the brilliant portrayal of the futile and toothless system that prevails in some parts of the country.","The foreplay between the religious, political, and administrative systems is sickening in some parts of the country. Nothing new. But every once in a while, a film comes that reminds you of that 7th page news item you dismissed with a nod of helplessness. Throughout Aakrosh you want to ask the question, ""how can these local goons/politicians/police get away with it?"" And every time the film reminds you of the horrifying nexus which barely shakes by something we commoners call ""HUGE"" scam.We see the world of the deteriorated legal system in Bihar through the eyes of the CBI investigators played by Ajay Devgn and Akshay Khanna. They are frustrated and left aghast by the situation, and so are we as an audience. This is when the issue of ""honor killing"" is barely talked about. In fact, it's assumed that the audience knows what the issue is. The reason for the atrocities are more or less left to our imagination. So people expecting ruthless bigotry won't see that. But ruthlessness, they'll see for sure. This ambiguous justification might as well be intentional. The issue could be anything, the vulnerability of the powerless, is after all, the same. Only words like helpless and defenseless come to mind because as you see the massacre you wonder, ""is fighting for the cause, however valid worth it?"" Sure, t cause might be worth fight for. But when fighting for it ends up killing hopes and the people the hope belongs to, who is the fight for? The fact that I can just spend three paragraphs just discussing the issue says that Priyadarshan has hit the nail. The direction is smart and razor-sharp. The joy of seeing a director, with so many awful films to his name, make such brilliant camera decisions is inexpressible. Because of his guidance, I witnessed some of the best performances from actors I've always admired. Amongst the many villains of society, the policeman that Paresh Rawal plays is the one you want to see beaten to a pulp. Such emotion for an actor I look forward to watching - you can judge the power of his act. We've seen Ajay Devgn in similar roles, but you only want more, even if it's the same from him. True, his antics as Spiderman and James Bond do make you laugh. Though because it's all done well, the occasional 'whoa' does make an escape from your mouth. If only such action fit into the genre of social awakening. The rest of the cast do their bit, albeit not necessarily as impressively. Any non-actor could easily have played Akshaye Khanna and Bipasha Basu and we wouldn't know the difference. Also their characters aren't too detailed. While Bipasha Basu's character might serve the purpose of giving some backstory to other characters, Akshaye Khanna's character's only purpose seems to be to echo our thoughts, the thoughts of the city-bred audience.  A person to whom an explanation can be given, so that the audience's question is also answered. The other flaw in the writing is that there is no flow between scenes. The events all look too disjointed. While these things are somewhat acceptable, the songs and more so their abrupt placement in the film are just unforgivable. Not only are they obviously gratuitous, they completely ruin the build of the situation. This is also true of a few scenes where the pauses last a few seconds or the camera lingers longer than necessary. They make an otherwise well-paced film seem sluggish. Yet, it is well worth the buck because Aakrosh has some of the most well-shot chase sequences - on foot, cycles and cars. Meanwhile, the issue raised is something that is not talked about too often. Even if people aren't killed too often, there are far too many couples who have to either part ways/live a very difficult life because they belong to different caste/region/religion. Nothing to be proud of, but needs to be documented. Hopefully the future generations will be able to take pride in the fact that they have evolved as human beings.

41,Aamir,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma reviewNotepad18 Critic Reviews 4.4/5.0 6 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/aamir-review/,4.4/5.0,5/5.0,,4.5,"There isn't one single department which can claim that it carried Aamir on its shoulders. Each and everything - make-up, set design/locations, background music, lighting, camera work, dialogue, and of course acting work towards creating the build-up and the final impact. And what's more religious fundamentalism is dealt with subtlety - the lost virtue. It has been maintained almost throughout, except for the abruptness of the background music in parts and the portrayal of the antagonist.","So many movies based on religious fundamentalism have come and gone, that you wonder if any stone is left unturned in this territory. And then comes along a movie like Aamir that not only defies all standards of film-making in Hindi cinema, but also breaks barriers of approaching the subject. Be warned though, that you are in for a very slow paced, extremely serious cinema.Movies of this genre are made to inspire the audience. And usually they end up inspiring by a long, unwieldy sermon in the climax. But here, since you are so in tune with what the character is going through just by seeing him, you start thinking how you would react in that situation. And ultimately, you realize its all building towards inspiring you by action and not just by words. Every time I watch a Hindi movie in which I feel what the protagonist is going through without anyone telling me, but just by observation, it scores with me. Such is the brilliance of the performance by Rajeev Khandelwal who plays Aamir Ali. Despite knowing very little about the kind of person Aamir is, we feel what he is going through on that particular day of his life.His performance is adequately supported by regular day-to-day dialogues. Also, since the dialogues are minimal, the plain lines don't get boring. The dialogues given to the villain though are repetitive and thus mundane. Also, the ""villainish"" things he is made to do on his chair in a dimly-lit room are too in-the-face and unimaginative compared to the tone of the rest of the movie. Because they come across as typical, you are reminded that you are actually watching a movie. And thus he hardly strikes terror in the minds of the audience. What is terrorizing though, is the ambience created by the sets/locations. Be it a stench-filled place, or a claustrophobic hotel room that Aamir is confined in, or the crowded roads where he feels everyone is watching him - all make you feel like getting Aamir out of there as soon as possible. The lighting keeps in mind the source of natural light in each scene and adds towards the ""natural"" feel of the movie. Similarly, the camerawork - especially the close-ups and handheld camera movements get you deeper into Aamir's state of mind. Even the combination of slow pace and short run-time works towards achieving the required impact. There is a bit when 3 minutes into the story, time is actually elongated to maybe almost double its length. But since the movie itself is barely over 90 minutes, and you are so engrossed, the slow motion doesn't get annoying.The songs complemented this style of narration too. Especially ""ghumiyo"", which in a way was symbolic. The traffic jam Aamir is trying to resolve seems so much like the confusion in his life that he is trying to sort out. The background score is the only thing that seemed abrupt to me. As in the music itself was very good, but since it didn't flow from one scene to another, it felt jerky. Maybe, just maybe this movie could have dropped one level on the rating scale for a part of the audience because of its pace, but the build-up in the drama can only be sensed in a closed, dark environment. It would be injustice to all the faculties of film-making by watching it at home, with all the distractions and the smaller screen.

I understand you are curious about seeing Himesh on the big screen. But, would you want to add to their kitty by watching an absolutely worthless movie which is frilled with bad performances? Only saving grace is cinematography, but certainly doesn't make it worth your or any one else's hard-earned money.","I want to be an actor too - I have more than one and a half facial expressions. Oh, but will that mean I have to be a nasal singer and crack a poor joke about myself on the big screen? The good thing though, is that I would need to be a music director with just one tune in my head. Lyricists who can change the words around a bit here and there must be readily available. No, never mind, I can't, I don't wear a cap that a houseful theater would hoot and whistle at. Too predictable of one to talk about Himesh's cap, well if he can have a badly timed joke about it, why can't I?Okay, I exaggerated on the music bit. Himesh has certainly tried at least one tune (""Dil na todna"") a little out of his usual style, but listening to it you wish he hadn't. The camerawork and lighting of the first song ""assalaam vaalekum"" is beautiful. But then things deteriorate. Song-after-song-after-song (thank me for not doing that 5 more times). On the way he forgets pronunciation - have never heard ""bina"" and ""tanhaiyaan"" being crooned out so badly. And to top it off, we have the sacrilege called ""Mehbooba mehbooba"". Were they actually given permission to do this to a song from Sholay? Dear Mr. Burman, I apologize for listening to this version of arguably one of your best compositions. And while am it, Mohammad Rafiji, I am sorry for laughing out loud at what was done to ""dard-e-dil"" of Karz.Having totally trashed the two main attractions of the movie - the lack of acting by Himesh Reshammiya and then the music - I must tell you something about myself. I am a very patient person as far as movies are concerned. It is usually very difficult for a movie to bore me. Even after about half an hour post interval, I was hopeful. Hopeful that at least the story will be an actual thriller. Alas, the completely lose it thereafter! Far from causing any sort of a thrill, some bits were slow - allowing enough unintended giggle-time - and thus bored till hair be torn apart. The last half hour was plain, outright, superbly ridiculous!! Who gave them a right to take us so much for granted?!  There are no well rounded characters for me to really complain about character inconsistency. Anyone can do anything or nothing. Most characters can transform from evil to good without the slightest provocation and with most inane dialogues for support. And when there are such glaring gaps I don't really have the right to talk about details like a person changing his cap after being arrested.Ah yes, how can I not mention the quintessential ""oomph"" factor - Ms. Sherawat. She does her bit. Flaunts her body, dances a couple of dances, utters the mandatory line or two, because she is a character in the plot after all. And Ms. Motwani, well, she looks sweet and has so much eye-shadow on, that she can barely open her eyes. Oh yeah, and what is with the lipstick for Sachin Khedekar and the bright orange lip gloss for Pankaj Jha?What can I say when the most interesting part of the two+ hours spent in the theater was the 30 second teaser of ""Sultan The Warrior"" (actually looking forward to it!)?

Starts shabbily, reaches a peak around mid-way and ends more shabbily than it started. And yes, the issue is not ""quote system"", we are talking about our hollow education system here. Only that, that too gets a superfluous treatment.","The ""huh!?"" expression I've carried ever since the film ended is now expanded into a full question - If just the title of a film can cause an outrage big enough for the film to be banned in some areas of the country, what will happen if the film actually ends up being about the issue it is named after? We'll have to wait for another film to find out. Unless, of course, half of Aarakshan was reshot to make it ""not"" about reservations. After a half-an-hour full of songs, the characters are introduced and the base story is established. And then you hear the perfectly logical and valid sides of the quota-system debate amongst students and teachers, between authorities in education and media, husband and wife, father and daughter. And you are completely sucked into the drama. Only to be let loose very soon, to make sense of a confusion that the writer/director seem to have gone through - confusion about which story to tell. Aarakshan (with a different name) could have been a touching tale of a principled crusader, Dr. Prabhakar Anand (Amitabh Bachchan) who just refuses to be put down. His fight is not as much against the government's policy about reservation but against the businessmen who have made education a profitable transaction. And that concept alone has enough weight to make a movie by itself. I mean, I could have very easily let go of the title and readjusted my frame of mind to accept the story of the lovable, ideal teacher, Prabhakar. But, Aarakshan is too black and white to convince me. Sure, Prabhakar is not all good, and you see that through his daughter's eyes. But his righteousness is too overwhelming to let us see this not-so-white side. The other characters caving in to his goodness doesn't help either. His nemesis, Mithilesh (Manoj Bajpai) is outright black and makes you want to slap him, alright. The other characters have their shades of gray but they don't have enough screen time to let us appreciate them. Yep, including Deepak (Saif Ali Khan) and Poorbi (Deepika Padukone). And this is worse considering that the movie is two hours and forty-five minutes long. And even though, the performances by Amitabh Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, and Manoj Bajpai are enough to pull you through the saga, each of them has a caveat. Manoj Bajpai loses control in the climax without any build-up towards his breakdown. Saif Ali Khan has all of two scenes to make his point. And this is something Amitabh Bachchan can do half asleep. And I cannot stop admiring how the man, with his stature in the industry, can still portray the common man with drooped, burdened shoulders. If only, there was one film that would make us feel, ""this"" is why he does films. If only, this film had what it said it had. I was looking forward to a deeper understanding of the issue, I got songs. I was told an amazing cast will put up the two sides of the issue out on the big screen, they just came in and went out (just like the issues) with no flow and justifications. I was promised a film that will shake up the sleeping common man into action, but I got a solution that was no better than what the villains of the film were upto. And all of this was accompanied with loud background music which took away the little that the dialogues were building up to. ""Quiet Easily Done"" the film says repeatedly whenever Math students want to say, ""quod erat demonstrandu""referring to the acronym q.e.d. Aarakshan demonstrates how centuries of wrong done to certain castes can be quite easily undone. And maybe they are right. Most complex problems in life do have simple solutions. All we, the gullible audience, need to do is get together as a mass and protest. And yes, make that one call to the highest authority we can reach to solve our problem for us. Simple. Yep, that's the laughable solution Aarakshan gives us. Now, whose number do we dial to ask the politicians to call off the ban publicity stunt that the Aarakshan team just pulled.

But looks like the actors, writer/director, Nagesh Kukunoor and thus the audience lose it as the movie slogs along to the end. The metaphors are thrown at your face and explained in excruciating detail. And yet you don't know why the director/writer did what they did.","Aashayein stars 50 people whose days are numbered by some fatal disease. Almost all have come to terms with it. Some smile artificially. And a handful spit venom. How they coexist and come to love each other is what Aashayein could have been about. And I agree, that would have been plain boring and the base story needed something additional and Nagesh Kukunoor has that on the platter too. Just that the spoon-feeding of how and why it is different didn't entirely appeal to my taste buds. And of course they went berserk with the ""metaphors"" as the end approached too. Symbolism remains symbolism if it's left to interpretation. Some parts of the film feel like a 'Metaphor 101' class, to teach us, the ignorant audience, the basics of film-reading.  It is very painful to see a double and triple display of what the writer meant by showing a particular sub-pot, as if to make sure that even those in the audience dozing don't miss it. I was in awe when some of the metaphorical stuff started. But they rub it in too much and the charm goes away. Oh and, it becomes more and more ridiculous. So, it ends up making you laugh instead of making you think. Also the writer makes things unnecessarily awkward too often. Usually, I blame the execution for the uneasiness the actors/director felt in a particular scene. But, here the writing felt forced and you could sense how hard the script had to go against its nature to make room for a 'different' situation/action/reaction. A simple thing like a hug between two characters came across as if one of them is being forced into it. It almost felt like the writer was on an emotional up and down. He has created this world with different characters and their quirks. He digs a little deep into their emotions, panics at what he sees (also panics at this perception of the audience's reaction) and surfaces to breathe. And this jagged script becomes a pain to swallow. And all you remember is that pain and forget some of the most beautiful moments and relationships that he creates.Anyway. There is a takeaway from the film. Anaitha Nair, this little girl was the life of the film. She played the blunt, toxic, vulnerable, teenager Padma so casually, that you feel compassion towards her wicked character. Exactly what you are supposed to feel for her. That doesn't mean John Abraham didn't do well. It's just that, if a man is dying you are supposed to feel sorry for him, not drool at him. Emotions don't particularly show up very well when he tries them on. But the man tries hard, only problem is the effort is too transparent. A touch of humor in the dialogues,  the songs, especially the lyrics, and some of the close-up shots also go into the ""saving grace"" list. But...With a heavy heart, I have to say Nagesh Kukunoor doesn't crack it with Aashayein either. I wouldn't say the film starts off well. It has its share of cliché's, badly written scenes. Like the rest of the film, the beginning too, escapes under the guise of calling the action/dialogue filmy and doing it anyway. But there are glimpses of above-average thought - both qualitatively and quantitatively - being put into some of the scenes. There is hint of a soul and as fate would have it, the hope dies as the post interval period starts.

It has decent performances, characters who know and show their feelings, a believable love story, yet it's not completely there.","Love... sigh... Haven't we all done something purely crazy because we believed that is what love is? And hasn't it been ages since we've seen moments of genuine selfless love on screen. It has been longer than that since I saw characters, in Hindi films especially, introspecting and knowing what the other person feels without being told. Aashiqui 2 is the film that has brought these things alive on screen. Yet, it  doesn't fill the gap for a love story that sucks you in completely with its romance.Once the characters Rahul Jaykar or RJ (Aditya Roy Kapoor) and Aarohi (Shraddha Kapoor) were established, it kept nagging me that I couldn't feel with the characters. Fine, the broad stroke of the story is predictable. But, every once in a while, there is a dialogue or a moment of introspection that makes you regard the character in new light. Here are lovers who take their time to fall in love and express it. Sure, there's the slow pace that can be blamed for making you wait for what happens next. But hey, if you are waiting for what happens next, the film is working just fine. After all here are two lovers, both singers of star status, one sticking on to the other when the going gets bad. Isn't that what we want our loved one to do for us? Isn't that what we'd do for our beloved?And there came the realisation! I know Aarohi and RJ are in love with each other. But, I know it because of what the characters do for each other or say to each other. It's not because I am with them in this journey of theirs. That emotional connect is missing. Interestingly enough, the actors cannot be entirely put to fault for this. Shraddha Kapoor's innocent face does half the work for her. I wouldn't take away from what she contributes as an actor here, but she has a charming screen presence. She brings through Aarohi's simple-mindedness and commitment with poise. Aditya Roy Kapur does his good-at-heart RJ genuinely. Despite your cynicism, you believe how selfless he is. On the darker side, you also don't question why he has set himself on a path of self-destruction. The bits, and these are big bits, where he falters are those where he tries to convince us he's drunk. And that's a huge let down. Shouldn't 'acting  drunk' be the primary qualification for an actor to be able to claim himself as one? Very rarely, do I feel like adding a separate comment about the director. I believe that everything that happens in the film is the director's doing. So, how I feel about every department of film-making is indirectly a comment on his work. Some of the tiny choices made here though, added to my experience. The casual way in which funny lines pass through without drawing extra attention to themselves, the control over drama when we are ready for melodrama - to name a few. Yep, these should be the norm by now. But, till it doesn't, it deserves extra mention if not points. The other departments too add to the ambience too. While the crisp camera-work lends a fresh feel to the film, the music kept me going with the flow of the film. I'm not sure if I would enjoy just listening to the songs. But, they worked really well within the context of the film. The film itself has a lovely flow (except for the abrupt last 10 minutes) despite being 15-20 minutes longer than I would have liked it. I must say I was surprised that I liked the film as much as I did. When I saw Aashiqui as a teenager, I remember thinking why do all love stories end up with either ""happily ever after"" or ""both die"". Aashiqui 2, with a few light moments in the beginning, a little drama and loads of non-eewww romance, holds your attention and keeps it there. It just doesn't reach out to your heart, wholeheartedly.

So, you end up having yet another lame horror film, that barely manages to spook you. ","Aatma leaves you with many questions. Why are most horror films all the same? Why are they oh-so-lame? Why do they have to involve an artist who's a child? Are horrified adults too mild? These are not rhetorics, they are genuine questions. Aatma starts out, right from the trailers, with the premise of a dead dad wanting to be with his child. Aatma stays there pretty much right till the end. There is very little in terms of movement from this baseline. Sure, there are doctors, priests and murders, but they are pretty much predictable. And what's a horror film going to horrify you with, if you know what's going to happen next. Without that as a support, the audience has to more or less rely on the performances to feel for or against the characters. Nawazuddin Siddiqui does invoke disgust and anger even before he's shown on the screen. However, taking nothing away from his acting effort, those negative emotions are more directly correlated with the characterisation. Again, once it is invoked, it stays put. You cannot but ignore the fact that there was a decent chance of revealing his intentions gradually, thus building the drama to a high. But well, they let that cat out in the promos itself. Bipasha Basu does the drill of being a very scared, concerned mother. But, she can do only so much if the screenplay has her sleep away from her child who seems to be in fatal danger. At the risk of revealing a little detail, the said scene has Bipasha Basu's Maya sleep with her mom and be comforted by her and the daughter-in-danger is sleeping in another room! And what about our concern for our child artists? Should any human be put through the ordeal of acting in roles that require them to be possessed and murder people brutally (Doyel Dhawan) - at age 6! And this is not specific to this film, or even just Hindi films, why should any child be put through first giving those performances and then watching themselves on the screen. What kind of a messed up race are we, if we need to use the tenderness of age to entertain us? (I can only hope that the said artists aren't allowed to watch such of their films until they are of age. But, I know that is highly unlikely.)And the sad part is, it doesn't even spook us. We've seen it so many times over that we are now immune to possessed children. Oh well.I am nit-picking then when I point out a ""Whhaat?"" moment, when I see a school teacher sitting on her desk, while teaching - one-leg-over-another in a short skirt! Yeah, petty me. If I had to pick one positive in the entire film, it would be attempt at mood. The gloomy blues create the right atmosphere, even if it is pretty dark during day time. However, the background music and all the other elements bring the film down to below average. So, a courtesy tip towards science and God later, the film and your miseries end. Aatma is short, and even if it is certainly not sweet, you thank the writers for small mercies.

47,Abduction,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review,/movie/abduction-review/,,,,3.233333333,"Taylor Lautner, of the Twilight series fame, must have thought he’s making a relevant career jump. Except even in Abduction, he plays a forcibly serious, lost teenager with a brooding personality, similar to Jacob from the Twilight series. Watch Abduction only if you really need any (pathetic) excuse to see Taylor Lautner on screen.","A few weeks ago, when we caught the trailer of Abduction on IMDB, a friend happened to bring something very relevant to my notice. In essence, Abduction looked like it was a more stylized, self-serious version of the forgettable Salman Khan Starrer Tumko Na Bhool Payenge (TNBP). I wanted to disagree  because secretly I found Taylor Lautner very umm...good looking. But I couldn’t – and this further reinforced after I watched the film.Abduction is centered on a teenager, Nathan Harper (Lautner) who figures that he’s been lied to about his identity when he finds his baby picture on a missing person’s website. Further investigation into this takes him on an unexpected journey of (predictable) revelations and a web of complicated truths about his identity. He has recurring dreams about his hidden identity (Reason for comparing to TNBP no 1), for which he seeks psychiatric help. Unfortunately that doesn’t stop him from being sunk into the messy whirlpool. Of course, it all sorts itself out once Lautner decided to bare his shirt (reason no. 2) and take matters in his own hands. Alongside his high school crush, Karen Lowell (Lily Collins), he embarks upon a brave (allows the heroism) little expedition that makes for a repetitive, bordering on hilarious visual experience. The film faults fundamentally with its inability to evoke empathy for the lead teenager who is in such a mess. Even if we manage to move above and beyond a relationship (or lack thereof) with the protagonist, what jars the most about Abduction is the fact that everybody in the film, most of all Director, John Singleton takes themselves much too seriously, and for no real reason, I deduced. Singleton’s 2 Fast 2 Furious was at least true to its genre - of being a fast paced, testosterone pumping, macho film.  Writer Shawn Christensen has written a script of convenience. Clues just happen to fall upon Nathan’s lap, he just happens to have exactly what he needs at any given moment of time – there’s no intellectual struggle on his part. The only struggle we see is with Lautner and his acting abilities. And we know he’s hot- but it can’t all be a breeze for him, can it?The film looks its part though – with a monotone palate and of course, it helps to have a good looking protagonist, but on every other account, Abduction fails. You know a film is bad, if I recommend you watch the Twilight series instead.

A breezy, charming film and funny in a very British manner. ","Haven’t you, at least once in your life, wished that you could travel back in time to undo something that you’d done, or to do something differently? And what if you suddenly had that power? How much of your life would you change, and how much of that power would you use to chart the course of your future? Either way, even with this power, would one still really have any control over destiny?Any time travel film makes you ponder over these questions, but Richard Curtis’s About Time is actually built around them. 21-year-old Tim discovers that he has the ability travel through time. Once Tim figures out how it works, he goes about trying to ensure that life for him pans out just the way he wants it.Curtis, quite the master of mush, creates a warm little world for gawky Tim; a world that makes you smile more than once, because of some adorable characters and some genuinely witty moments involving Tim and the people in his life; his father (an adequately charming Bill Nighy); Mary, the woman he loves (a slightly miscast but still lovable Rachel McAdams); his sister Kit Kat; and some more. Tim – played with the perfect mix of earnest awkwardness and charm by Domhnall Gleeson – is also often faced with situations that don’t necessarily involve him directly, but which make him want to use his power nonetheless.Despite the unfair advantage that Tim has in his life, you’re almost always rooting for him. You can almost tell when and why he’ll use his power, and how it will go. What makes you want his life to turn out just the way he wants it to is the fact that you can see that Tim is fundamentally a good guy. He wouldn’t use his power to harm anyone, and the manner in which his character is written and acted convinces you of that almost instantly. The film’s weakest aspect is the time travel itself. Even though it is used with the intent of conveying a certain message each time and is to be taken at face value, the fact remains that it takes too many logical liberties far too often. So, instead of focusing on the ‘where’, ‘why’ and ‘when’ of it – which is what the film is actually supposed to be about – you’re left wondering about the ‘how’ - how did that happen, exactly, when it was clearly against the ‘rules’?Simply put, you’re left thinking about the logical inconsistencies when instead you should be buying in to the film’s core message. Also, the film really slows down towards the end, when the message has been adequately hammered on your head a few times, and it still waits to spell the whole thing out for you.Despite the voluminous plot holes, the film’s warm, self-deprecating, quite British humour, the performances, and the honest message that the film tries to convey makes About Time a film that is never offensive and invariably happy. People in a certain frame of mind often look for a particular kind of film to catch on DVD or TV to elevate their mood. About Time is precisely that kind of film. Either directly or indirectly, it will make you see that there’s no greater waste of time than a bad mood.

49,Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/abraham-lincoln-vampire-hunter-review/,,,,3.233333333,"The novel that Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is based on was a best-selling success for quite a while. Maybe it’s an easier read than watch, but a movie that discusses Abraham Lincoln’s fictional dual life as a closet vampire hunter is bizarre and not Tim Burton bizarre but confusing bizarre. The visuals, costumes and performances allow you to at least sit through the film and lend yourself as a viewer. Apart from that, the film has nothing really going for it. ","Remember the time when a Tim Burton movie surpassed your expectations on its levels of eccentricity (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands)? Well you can mourn those days, because it doesn’t look like they’re coming back. Earlier this year he made Dark Shadows, which was quite the dud compared to his earlier films, and therefore I wasn’t expecting too much from his co-production with Timur Beckmambetov (of Wanted fame) Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. The title itself is rather appalling, to imagine the United States’ 16th president as a closet Vampire Hunter. As if we haven’t already had an overload of vampires. It’s not a biopic of Abraham Lincoln so you can scratch that off. In this version surrounding the president (adapted from a bestselling novel written by Seth Grahame-Smith), a young Lincoln witnesses the death of his mother as a result of befriending an African-American boy (a prevalent practice back in the day). The film moves onto Lincoln’s dual life – as he falls in love with Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and eventually enters politics, but the film focuses on his nocturnal activities and adventures, consisting a slasher, VFX heavy second half that includes fictitious recreations of American History as well. While the visuals are quite gripping with its dark greys and even darker crimsons, the two halves of the film seem like separate movies. Not knowing which aspect of Lincoln’s life to focus.  The narrative is disconnected and seems to focus more on the visual appeal than the story at hand. Benjamin Walker as Lincoln is pretty convincing, and for interrupted brief moments you do believe that a world where Lincoln was a vampire hunter could exist. What helps are the elaborate set designs, costumes and background score, which allow the suspension of disbelief to last a while. You are pulled out of it however, with the confused narrative. The cuts between an enraged axe-wielding Lincoln and a historically relevant Lincoln are haphazard. You’re kept on your toes about the tone of the film.t partly presents itself as a dark, bloody fantasy film and partly as a biopic offering silly, almost comical alternatives to American History.What you must give Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter credit for, is that it is brilliantly shot. Cinematographer Caleb Deschanel uses the frames to further the dark-palette visuals that merge well with the story. While on one hand you have a confused narrative that doesn’t stay with you, the visuals and technical bits of the film will manage to get your attention, and it’s the only reason why you should watch it.

But no detail to speak of and won't thrill an inch in you. You stay uninvolved and largely put off by what's going on, on the screen.","Rustic, grainy look. Immense style. Everything else wannabe - story, acting, thriller. There isn't even an attempt to get us hooked. They try hard, really hard to get us curious. But it doesn't work. And most unfortunately, we get the feeling that they think they are succeeding and are feeling good about it. So you have a situation with 6 people who have lost their memories locked in a clanky, metallic setting. No one knows who's who, including their own selves. Now doesn't that strike odd? No? How about I tell you even after watching the whole movie, identities known and all, it wouldn't matter which one of the 6 was which character. The personalities are pretty similar to each other. Age no bar, sex no bar. Even if they were interchanged at will, your reaction would still be an uninvolved, ""oh ok, if you say so."" That is if you are bothered to react after having already spent a good 100 minutes on the film already.  Of course there's so much that could be done with this situation, especially with the memory loss angle. But, na-ah, not a wrinkle on your forehead it brings. You are least interested in who's done what to whom. And it's difficult to point out why that is. Maybe because of the narrative style chosen. I usually enjoy two threads running together especially when they are set apart in time. But here, it just doesn't do it. Whether it is the lackluster story that happened in the history or whether the current situation is an overkill of drama for such a lame story in the background, I don't know. Both in parts, maybe. The non-performances don't help the do either. They actually made Dia Mirza shriek. That's just not fair. She can carry herself off in an action role, the lady can also emote, why make her character a prop? The other long list of equal length roles are all plain plain. You got to give some marks for the choice of texture for the film. Whether it was how the movie was shot or it was done in post-production is of little concern to the audience and the impact it has on them. The effect is pretty cool. And that's it. You enjoy the first 10 minutes and then what? There's nothing else to watch out for. Finito.So, yet another nice concept goes down the drain. This time because there's nothing other than the concept to chug the film forward. Oh well, waiting for the Diwali releases already.

51,Across the Universe,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/across-universe-review/,,5/5.0,,3.666666667,"Across The Universe is a heavy duty nostalgia trip, stylized and staged like a metaphorical bow to The Beatles. It emulates exactly everything that you would expect from a fan film – lot’s of music, re-done and a passable story. But beyond the music, the film has some visually exciting moments that make it worth a good watch and not just another Broadway show. ","Not all covers/remixes mean butchering a sanctified song, or including unnecessary add-ons. If handled aesthetically, some covers can bring a contemporary touch to a beautiful melody - but be warned, you need an open mind to appreciate them. It’s a different story however, with a film that’s in honor of the Beatles. Your first thought on Across The Universe would be exactly what the film gives you – lots of beatles’ tracks, a musical love story and every shot as a homage to the legendary band – with names of the characters (Jude, Lucy, Sadie, Prudence), street names (Abbey Road) and silly little references in the dialogue.Across The Universe follows a personal relationship between Jude (Jim Sturgess) and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) and is placed against the backdrop of the Vietnam War - a typical, grand love story which is forwarded by 33 Beatles songs. It’s experimental and a must-see for any Beatles fanatic because that’s just what we do - scrutinize anything and everything remotely related to the band – songs, documentaries, books and the works. The enjoyable thing about the film, however is that it brings much to the table for those who haven’t been crazy fans. Since it’s an out an out musical, the songs add the sense of drama to film. Across The Universe has an eclectic look (with costumes and the production design) that matches the psychedelic zone of the film set in the late 60s, and even though the story is simplistic, it’s universal in nature.Where the film wins however, is in its ability to bring to the viewer more than just another visual representation of the songs – presumably the same songs they’ve been hearing for years. How well they’ve been covered is a topic for another review, but most tracks add a new dimension to the song - With underwater sequences spilling into Ballet, stage performances that turn into a war scene adding an avant garde touch to the film. Here’s an example - I Want to Hold Your Hand  is originally an upbeat, peppy song about yearning love and in the movie when Prudence sings the cover in a slow, melodic manner (right after a teary scene) it becomes a yearning song about a hand she might never hold. There are many tracks in the move that allow for respectful deconstructions of timeless songs for a renewed understanding. For that reason alone this visual homage to the Beatles’ works. The 2 disc DVD set is like a goldmine – featuring the art from the film, an audio commentary from the director Julie Taymor (also the Broadway director of The Lion King) where she talks about why she needed to make a film and not a broadway show with , lots of deleted scenes, a 6-min long featurette on the usage of visual effects in the film and the best part – all 33 covers of the songs. You would think making a film like this would be fighting a losing battle. The ongoing debate about whether covers are good/bad/satisfactory doesn’t end with Across The Universe, but it takes some nerve to visualize a film that basically originates from 33 cover tracks. Across The Universe has its own personality, not a very gripping story but that’s pardonable and you’ll most certainly be humming a tune or two once the movie is over. If you find yourself liking a song better than the original don’t be afraid -  Let Yesterday Be, and buy the DVD.

There is about 10 minutes worth of story somewhere in there. But, does that really matter? And does it count that it doesn't matter?","Even if I know what to expect, and even if I know better than to expect any sort of entertainment from this crew, in this genre, I end up hoping to like at least something in it. I know its not the film's fault, and I have to suffer the brunt of my personality. But I did end up being more disappointed than I was expecting to be, is the best way I can put it. There are two-three things that I was actually pleasantly surprised to find in the film. Some sort of an attempt at a story, even if it comes only in the second half. The first half is as random as can be. And the stylish editing and general post-production of the action pieces. The color saturation and grungy look is ironically fresh because it is rare in Hindi films. Then you have the obsessive, almost obsessed vamp - as hardcore as vamps get, induces more fear than the ""main"" villain. But, none of these, except maybe for the vamp serve any specific purpose. They look more like they are incidental to the main objective of the film - displaying action by Ajay Devgn. So, the story seems like it exists because a part of the audience has silly expectations like a story line. The x-factor in the action sequences seem like they exist because the filmmakers wanted to have them and it didn't matter whether it fit in the texture of the rest of the film - which incidentally it didn't. Not to mention, I wondered more than once, if they were covering up for the lack of creativity in the action choreography department. The obsessive vamp then leaves you with very little in terms of hope. The supposed comedy doesn't bring half a smile. The dance sequences are way too generic for a film with the name Prabhu Deva attached to it. The lead ladies Sonakshi Sinha and Yami Gautam are as perfunctory as they could get. It all boils down to - does Ajay Devgn pulls the film through then? Well, yes and no. Yes, for those of us who don't mind what the film is about as long as Ajay Devgn is pulling his stunts right. No, obviously for the rest of us. I've had enough films that are banking on one star's stardom to pull an entire 2-2.5 hour film through - be it Akshay Kumar, Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan or my personal favorite Ajay Devgn. Sure most of them have either action, romance or a social message as the other anchor in the film. But, I know I've had enough. Aren't the actors done with these films that seem like it is more about them, the STAR?

Expect no more than that (not even a plot) and you'll be entertained...just about enough. The superficiality of depiction of the 70s era grates but the gags carry you through for some part.

Invariably, I end up choosing family. After all, there are many Fridays but only one Diwali in a year.
Handing it over to Ideasmith, who's reviewing Action Replayy for me. Thanks a ton! Means much! 
Wish you all a crackling Diwali and a brighter year ahead!If you are a fan of 70s pop culture, if ‘retro’ sounds like home to you, then please don’t watch Action Replayy – you might be tempted to destroy some furniture. If you are a sci-fi buff and still hold out for some promise in Bollywood, I suggest you look elsewhere. But if bright colours, loud noises and easy gags entertain you, Action Replayy just might work for you. Just don’t expect another Om Shanti Om. In some ways, Action Replayy is a fitting Diwali release, considering that the volume is turned up all through the movie. Think blinding pyschedelia in Eastman colour and crescendo-style background scores for the frequent melodrama scenes. The movie starts on the run, with everything speeded up, which you figure might be so that the story can get to the main meaty blast from the past. Once there, the plot loses its pace and runs on spoofy moments vaguely reminiscent of 70s cinema, like exaggerated caricatures and extreme proclamations (“No love marriage!”). The trouble with this spoof is its lack of authenticity. Considering that the subject is an age of rich iconography and abundant pop culture references, Action Replayy is woefully tacky in its depiction. Coverage is very superficial, sticking only to crazy hairstyles and an explosion of polka-dots in every scene. For the first half of the movie, the sheer novelty of time travel, the cinematic flourishes of switching to Eastman colour, the vibrancy of retro-style Bombay keep you engaged. The scene where Bunty (Aditya) first looks around and gets his bearings in 70s’ Bombay carries through predictably but nicely. After the interval, the mixed up references, the lack of a coherent plot and the jerky pace start to grate a bit. There is some saving grace in the chase sequence at the end, true to 70s cinema complete with action, comedy and romance.  Akshay Kumar hams it up as Kishen ‘Kitchen’ Kumar, the loser-turned-stud and it fits well enough in a movie of this type. Aishwarya Rai’s character seems to have gone astray since she starts off as shrewish, morphs into impish, detours into bully tomboy and finally dissolves into maudlin. Om Puri and Kiron Kher look like their having a real blast in their extreme but funny roles. A talented actor like Rajpal Yadav is sadly wasted in the sort of role usually reserved for the Johnny Levers and Jaspal Bhattis of current day Bollywood. Randhir Kapoor and Neha Dhupia each make blink-and-you-miss-it appearances. The real surprise in this movie is newcomer Aditya Roy Kapur who navigates the jerky plot with ease, holding his own superbly against the more senior actors (everybody else). Rannvijay Singh may have presence or he may not but its really hard to tell when he’s hidden behind the scary facial hair, styling and acting (possibly a throwback to the chest-rubbing aura of yesteryear Ranjit). The incomplete visual references aside, the music disappoints too, not because it is bad in itself but because music is a key aspect of Bollywood film-making and would be expected to deliver on the past versus present front. Most of it doesn’t fit the style of the era, in terms of melody, lyrics, instrumentation or even choreography. At times, it even even blunders into 80s-style bling or 60s-age nasal voices. Other than the credits theme in the very beginning, none of the other songs fit their situations, at all.If I sound disappointed, it’s only because I know that so much more could have been done even within the limited dimensions of this movie. Even going with a gag-ridden, cardboard-character spoof, the budgets might have been better used if the research had been a little deeper or the story better thought out. Instead, they seemed to have gone for flashy promos and trailers that cull most of the high points of the movie. Everything else is just bright colours and loud noises. Still, it is Diwali after all, so I suppose there is some timepass to be derived from those.

54,[The] Adventures of Tintin - The Secret of the Unicorn,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review4 Reader Reviews 5/5.0 20 Tweet Reviews 4.6/5.0,/movie/adventures-tintin-review/,,5/5.0,4.6/5.0,3.6,"The Adventures of Tintin, directed by Steven Spielberg, is a visual treat for lovers of animation films and fans of the comic book series. Though the story isn’t particularly great, the character quirks and perhaps the best animation seen to date ensure that the film keeps you entertained. The iconic comic book characters are brought to life in a way that the big screen hasn’t yet experienced. The dialogue will make you smile, and the action set pieces are thoroughly enjoyable. Purely for its visual appeal, this is a film that you might just enjoy on the big screen with family and friends.","When a little middle-class boy with big dreams in his eyes proclaims that he wants to make films, the first gentle rebuke he will probably hear is, ‘So, you want to be Spielberg?’ Such is the influence of the man – a man praised and criticized in equal measure. However, irrespective of which side of the fence you are on, there is no denying that few men have had the kind of influence on any facet of human history, as Steven Spielberg has had in the field of audio-visual entertainment. Spielberg’s latest, The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, is exactly that - an entertaining  film that is perhaps the closest that a big-screen adaptation has come so far, in capturing the essence of some of the most endearing and enduring comic book characters of all time.That Tintin, Captain Haddock, Snowy, and of course, Thomson and Thompson will bring a smile on your face is a given. Their quirks, their dialogue and their ‘unquenchable thirst for adventure’ have been brought alive by producers Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson in a revolutionary new way.Motion capture combined with incredible detailing in VFX brings the animation to life in a manner never seen before. Every reflection, every droplet of water, every tiny movement of human hair is unbelievably life-like. Only the characters’ faces (and at times their actions) betray that what one is viewing is indeed animation.Be it an incredible mid-sea battle amidst a raging inferno or a superb bike chase through the streets and homes of Morocco, the film is riddled with enthralling set-pieces that will make more than a few jaws drop. The film is rich in colour and more importantly, it is rich in atmosphere – something that goes a long way in sucking the audience in to the story. John Williams’ music score more than plays its part in enriching the atmosphere that the film manages to create.While the 3D in this film isn’t as big a waste as it has been in so many films, one still suspects that watching the film in 2D will not detract from the visual experience in any way. If anything, the colours are bound to be richer once the dark glasses are off.The department that the film suffers the most in is the script. The mystery itself isn’t as mysterious as one would have liked. The twists and turns are there, but there is really nothing that will make you sit at the idiomatic edge of your seat. However, the quirkiness of the characters, particularly Captain Haddock, makes up in part for the deficiencies in the script. The characters keep you entertained at all times.Yes, that aspect which Spielberg is criticized the most for is present all over this film – the manner in which it is moralistically sanitized. The edginess, the layers, the nuances of real human behavior and the shades of grey that someone who is not a Tintin or an animation fan would want are noticeably absent. This is the one area where this film would fall behind iconic Pixar films like Finding Nemo, Toy Story and Wall-E. Ultimately, The Adventures of Tintin is an entertaining film for children as well as adults, particularly those who enjoy animation. The realistic animation is a visual treat, and there would be few who would not feel an adrenaline rush at least once during the film. Make no mistake, as far as animation technique in cinema is concerned, the envelope has been pushed. Even we who feel that audio-visual entertainment and cinema are often worlds apart would have to agree.

55,Ae Dil Hai Mushkil,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma reviewNotepadPreview36 Critic Reviews 2.8/5.0 6 Reader Reviews 3/5.0 109 Tweet Reviews 3.9/5.0,/movie/ae-dil-hai-mushkil-review/,2.8/5.0,3/5.0,3.9/5.0,3.233333333,"An ode to unrequited love and its victims. Reminds them to bask in their one-sided love's glory. The film slices and dices emotional relationships in many, many ways. Watch but please not with cynical unromantics. ","Ae Dil Hai Mushkil gives one-sided lovers hope. Not the kind that says, ""ask for something with all your will, and the entire universe shall conspire to make it happen"". Ae Dil Hai Mushkil gives those stuck in unrequited love the hope that says, it's ok. Because it's yours. And because it's yours it's beautiful.I could go on and on about how Ae Dil Hai Mushkil has embraced and comforted relationships whole-heartedly. I want to go on and on. But let me get the unwanted out of the way first. The film does some very avoidable things. Some films use voice-overs; others use a character as a narrator; yet others have long-standing friends talk like strangers for the audience's benefit - all annoying tools; all indicators of lack of confidence in the script. This one uses an interview. *eyeroll* - *whatever* - *shrug off* - *move on*. Then you have one too many film-y references, even if they are masked under characters who are self-confessing ""Bollywood fantasy-livers"". They are just about well-placed and stop before they get too many. Could they have cut down the 45 minutes beyond 2 hours? I bet, yes. Tributes, spoofs – notwithstanding. It also has the laziest cop-out out of a love triangle that writers take. A few more *eyerolls* and *oh-nos!* directed towards the writers. You also have the drop in pace in the first half. The couple of scenes after the ""break-up song"" saw my heart sink after an otherwise decent-ish start. It started treading towards the usual Karan Johar territory - tacky, slapsticky, and over-the-top. It thinks it is clutching at your heart, but it isn't quite there. But it completely recovers from this fall in the second half, even if after a couple of slips.Had we known that this was the love triangle Karan Johar was struggling for all these years, we would have held our curses a bit through Kuch Kuch Hota Hai's superficial and simplistic take on love, Kabhie Khushi Kabhie Gham's devotion to family, Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna's cringe-inducing take on extra-marital affairs and so on. Ae Dil Hai Mushkil doesn't go far from the one-line plot, but it goes deeper, much deeper. Through various characters in these films, he has fleetingly touched upon the various kinds of love he has brought together in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. There's the love that exists yet can't resist the temptations of lust. There's love that's so self-aware that it refuses to fall into the trap yet another time and goes into self-preservation mode - pronto. Then you have love that is too precious to want to be lovers - friend-zoned, if you will. Alongside is the love that has lost all self-respect in the gamble. The mightiest of them all - the love that wants, nae demands reciprocation - 100% reciprocation. And they aren't mutually exclusive either. But, through this Ae Dil Hai Mushkil wants to say just one thing - it is all still love. Just different from one another. Clearly the focus is the different forms love takes and not things that mortals have to worry about like – earning a livelihood, having other responsibilities and so on. The writers even write it off with a scene that declares them rich kids. Now, if you have a problem with rich kids who have difficulty dealing with their heartaches, you want to watch another film. The understanding of and maturity in relationships is all they want to talk about. It could have gone all awry if it wasn't articulated well in words and their translation to film. From the captain of the boat to the different cogs that make a film work. This is not a film where one character is oblivious to the feelings of the other when it is so obvious. They are what people do in real life – in denial. The film is sprinkled with actual conversations, something I find lacking in Hindi romantic films. The dialogue is snappy and you could miss out a witticism here and a good line there if you don't pay keen attention. The two outbursts, one each by Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma, hit target - they are brilliantly worded, well-timed and enacted with conviction. One expresses the helplessness of having failed after trying everything to get over, to move on, to find a moment of peace. The other is a frustrated expression of a different perspective on love. And then there is a scene with wonderfully written lines for a cameo. If only the actor had played a character and not a charismatic personality which reminds us of the real-life star who wants to pass on the “romantic hero” baton. Aishwarya Rai does femme fatale beautifully. Ranbir Kapoor holds the screen well, especially in close-ups. Something, I've admired Amitabh Bachchan do. Even though his pain-ridden eyes are all too familiar, they leave their impact. Again. Though there are times he goes over-the-top, something we rarely see him do. So, I'd blame the director. I absolutely love the way Anushka Sharma has grown into the roles she takes on - bringing an uncanny reality about them. Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma together too, make every bit of their relationship relatable. The ladies do goof up their diction every once in a while. And Fawad Khan's character is almost inconsequential to convince me about the hullabaloo caused by his presence in the film.I am divided about watching this film again. My heart was beating hard while walking out of the theater for having watched a solid, good film. Enough for me to want to walk into the next show right away. But, what if I don't like what I liked about the film as much as I did in first go? I think I am eager to find out.

56,After Earth,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/after-earth-review/,,5/5.0,,3.9,"M. Night Shyamalan’s After Earth may not be the epic that the makers of the film had promised, but perhaps it also isn’t the outright disaster that most critics proclaimed it to be.","No recent film highlights the importance of context and baggage in how a film is received than M. Night Shyamalan’s After Earth. If it wasn’t enough that the director himself was under fire for previous debacles like The Last Airbender, After Earth is produced and its story was written by Will Smith, with the Hollywood superstar himself playing one of the two lead characters, and his son Jaden Smith essaying the other – a larger-than-life sci-fi father-son story. Then there were reports of how much had been put into making the film a large franchise, and not just one restricted to cinema. Needless to say, the film was perceived as a gloated, indulgent vanity affair, and was near-universally panned on its release earlier this year. There’s no doubt that those involved in the making of the film were largely to blame for the negative vibes that the film had all around. But, I also firmly believe that every film deserves at least one more chance – and more so with After Earth, because it barely received even a first chance.Stripped away from all of the pre-release buzz, After Earth still has plenty of flaws, but I couldn’t help feeling that perhaps the world had been a tad too harsh on it. Most of the issues with After Earth lie in its suspect screenplay, a cast that loses out a bit in actual performance what it gains in screen presence, and some inconsistent VFX – good in some places, but amateurish in others.Despite the flaws, though, the film isn’t entirely unwatchable. It is, after all, a father-son reconciliation story as well as the coming of age tale of a young boy, set in a hostile future world. These themes always find some measure of resonance even when made by inexperienced filmmakers – and one can hardly call Shyamalan that. Couple those with the adventure and action elements and a run-time of just 100 minutes, and After Earth isn’t entirely a waste of time.Will Smith plays Cyper Raige – a legendary soldier who is about to retire. His son Kitai Raige has been trying hard to live up to his father’s name, but seems to end up short. Their relationship is then tested to the full as they face a danger that they had scarcely imagined.How one wishes that Jaden Smith had inherited some more of the acting skills of his father. With the innocent charm that he had in The Pursuit of Happyness all but gone, he has to rely on genuine performance to make an impact in After Earth, and he doesn’t always succeed in his endeavour. It doesn’t help that he and his father spend most of the screen time away from each other, communicating wirelessly. He doesn’t have the advantage of some of Will Smith’s persona rubbing off on him on screen – something that always happens with stars like Smith. The most interesting aspect of the film is how it deals with the concepts of danger and fear – how the former is real, but the latter is merely a state of mind, and can hence be completely avoided. The practical manner in which this forms the crux of the story is actually some ingenious bit of writing. Also, the concept of a planet Earth that has now become not just uninhabitable but hostile towards human beings is another original idea that holds merit. The film suffers because of the visualization of this Earth, and because of one of the usual pitfalls of a futuristic film – showcasing technology that hardly seems to make any logical sense.The problem with After Earth was that it was packaged as an epic. Instead it should have been packaged as an intimate father-son story, with the epic feel coming off naturally, rather than being forced down the audience’s throat. The same applies for the DVD as well – the DVD case is just different enough from the usual cases that DVDs come packed in, for the unsuspecting to believe that the film they’re holding in their hands is some sort of an epic. The pack is nice, if only the film was better.The contents of the DVD, though, are not disappointing, because of the bonus features. The DVD has three featurettes in it, and each of them give an insight into the making of the film. ‘A Father’s Legacy’ takes a look at Will and Jaden on and off screen, and thankfully it doesn’t get too mushy. ‘1000 years in 300 Seconds’ is a rapid behind the scenes look at the film that is brief, but still quite interesting. And lastly, the gorgeous locales where the film was shot are showcased in a featurette titled ‘The Nature of the Future’. Mostly for cinephiles, the bonus features of the After Earth DVD are certainly no let down.Another good touch, which I believe should be a must for all DVDs releasing in India, is the regional languages option. This one comes with Hindi, Telugu & Tamil, and also has the option of English or Hindi subtitles. Because the film itself is by no means a ‘must watch’, the After Earth DVD is hard to recommend strongly. However, for pure academic interest, to discover just how much of the way a film is received by a viewer depends on what the viewer takes in to the film with him, After Earth is a film that one wouldn’t particularly mind catching on home video.

57,Agent Vinod,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma reviewNotepadPreview52 Critic Reviews 1.6/5.0 7 Reader Reviews 4/5.0 181 Tweet Reviews 1.9/5.0,/movie/agent-vinod-review/,1.6/5.0,4/5.0,1.9/5.0,2.5,"An almost 3-hour long, slick chase sequence that gets exasperating by the end. The climax itself is first unintentionally hilarious and then infuriating. A suave hero you couldn't care for, a pretty damsel-in-distress who exists only to add stress to the hero's life and ours - this situation saved by a brilliant (albeit choppy) background score and a couple of uber-cool action sequences. ","How often have you seen the Indian audience bank their hopes on the director instead of the stars? From my parents to my readers, the voices have turned excited as soon as they realized Agent Vinod is by the Johnny Gaddar guy. And it's not like the stars Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor are disliked or scoffed at. Hence, you resist the disappointment with the director/writer as you jeer, mock-cheer, tch-tch-tch and ultimately slap your forehead in despair as Agent Vinod progresses towards regression. You can sense director, Sriram Raghavan's discomfort with the extra money - just like a person who is uneasy among hoity-toity, snotty people, would be at a page-3 event. For all you know,  Raghavan's original story, like his earlier ones, might have been set between Mumbai, Pune, Goa and Delhi. But, well, what would he do with all the extra money? So, let's make the RDX into a nuclear bomb and voila, you have Morrocco, London, the works. We still have money left. Hmmm...songs, let's do songs. A lavish 'mujra' and a scintillating mix of color and light in a Gothic set should do the trick. Sure, you could call it the pressures of commercializing a product. But, I'd like to give  Raghavan a little more credit than that. I think he's smart enough to know that he doesn't need to commercialize his product. He is the brand. But, oh well. Who said an intelligent person has to be confident about handling money?The sign that things might not be all right show from the first sequence. A quote from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly cuts into a scene which feels like it is right out of that film. Is it a spoof? Is it a tribute? No, it's a desert in Afghanistan. Should you smile at the reference, should you engage with a tortured RAW agent? Thankfully, this is soon followed by a slickly choreographed action sequence. But the confused genres show up again before you can feel reassured that you have some mind-blowing action to look forward to. Like any half-decent thriller, Agent Vinod fools you, leads you on, makes you feel smart about yourself by having characters smile that weird smile which tells you they are upto something, throws in your face a tattoo or a musical instrument-cum-weapon you ought to remember. But at each juncture, Agent Vinod leaves a loophole waiting to be answered. Whatever made sense, left the house at interval. The last 30 minutes feels like another film that started after the first one had the most ridiculous finish. The climax of this climax made me angry. Did they even realize what they were implying an agent from India's intelligence agency did?! People who know nothing about national security would come up with a solution like this after being a few drinks down. That besides and saving a few wise-cracks, the writing had way too many distractions, be it story, screenplay or characters. For example, with every film referenced, from Don to the original Agent Vinod to Charlie Chaplin, you are taken away from the mystery Agent Vinod is trying to solve. So eager is Sriram Raghavan to make his reverent tributes that he didn't realize how they are deviating from the genre. (Oh, how I'd loved the way he paid his respect to Anand in Johnny Gaddar!)Then, throughout the film, characters are introduced either to be killed or they turn out to be an undercover terrorist/agent. I'd love for a psychoanalyst to analyze Agent Vinod (Saif Ali Khan) - he's confused about a childhood memory; he switches between being an aware human with a gut-feeling and an insensitive man's man. But then, that would mean the psychoanalyst and I would be spending more time on the character than the writers. Similarly, Irma (Kareena Kapoor) is introduced as a doctor who is an aide to a terrorist but takes refuge as soon as she sees a capable man around. The way she became a pitiable woman at the drop of a hat, there was an instant when I doubted myself. I wondered whether I'd misunderstood that she was supposed to be either an international agent or a terrorist. The chemistry between the Agent Vinod and Irma was dropped down to pillow talk between Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor. No people, no need to get excited. It's the kind of pillow talk that can put you to bed. No single character has a stay long enough to make an impact or engage except for Adil Hussain who had an elegant terror about him. Ravi Kissen and Ram Kapoor had fun-type quirky characters, while Prem Chopra was an annoying caricature. For the kind of terrorist he is proposed to be, he seemed weirdly compliant. Others like B P Singh and Mariyam had too annoying an accent and delivery style to consider anything else. And there are a few blink-and-miss cameos too.I realize that I'm tipping heavy on the story and characterization in an action film. But that has a lot to with this being a Sriram Raghavan product. I know he has a smart style of narrating his story, but what troubles me is that this is like any other action film, especially since you have a wide range of Hollywood franchises to choose from. Also, somehow when Agent Vinod does it, it doesn't look as real as a Bond, Hunt or Bourne. It might have to do with the impression that MI6 is more capable than RAW. Throughout the film, I marveled at the different sound that the film had and how my feet tapped to the background score continuously. But, did it add to the story's character? It felt like the background music was on a different trip altogether. Similarly, sure, the camerawork, editing and some of the action sequences were state-of-art but they seemed like a different department not necessarily congruent with the story. Parts added together, certainly. But did they make the film whole?Again, the songs, 'Raabta' did a 'khoya khoya chand' from Shaitan. And I can't thank the decision-makers enough for not having 'Pungi' as a part of the film, but I'd have liked to say nicer things about what they did do rather than what they didn't.

58,Aggar,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma reviewNotepad19 Critic Reviews 2.0/5.0 3 Reader Reviews 2/5.0,/movie/aggar-review/,2.0/5.0,2/5.0,,1.966666667,We have a bunch of overactive crew members in the form of the background music director and the twists-in-the-plot writer. These are balanced off with underactive wooden one-expression-fits-all actors,"""dhik-chak--dhik-chak-dhum-dhum"". What a warm welcome! That's the background score using all its extra energy. Well-accompanied with well-endowed cleavage. No - there isn't any connection. That’s just what stares you in the face at the word go. The interesting editing used in the beginning to establish the characters makes you ignore the loud score - at least for a bit. Unfortunately though, the story is pretty much predictable and thus becomes a chore to watch.Everything seems half-baked or in some cases completely uncooked. Shreyas Talpade looks good but seemed a bit off playing the mature character. Then again, that might have been very intentional. Udita Goswami plays a character who is constantly under duress and underdressed. So can’t really blame her for the singular expression she wears through most of the movie. Tusshar Kapoor - can't blame him either. He was miscast. Look at him! Obsessed lover? Doesn't work at all!As in most cases, the script is the deal breaker here. It is neither coherent, nor researched, and has got it all wrong as far as plot points is concerned. ""slish-slash-whiplash"". The background score is still at it. And so is the flesh show. Towards the end, your head is spinning. One would think I am trying to blame the music, but I am not. It’s the multiple supposed ""twists"" that get annoyingly weary on my one-kilo brain. So much so that you begin suspecting the very premise of the whole plot.I completely understand that the film-makers believe that the genre required loud music. I am glad though that they didn't think so about camerawork. That and the slick editing put together made some parts really interesting, visually. Especially during the titles and a couple songs. While the music is just about alright, the lyrics of ""ke bin tere"" are nice.""tak-tada-tak-bluck-bluck"". They just won't let go...till the last shot. I admit it is a bit unfair to pick on just the background score, when almost every other department needed a lot more work and re-work.

Weed out the unnecessary elements, fill in the blanks, and be ready for the brickbats from those for whom the original is now ""cult"". For those like me, who are not a part of that sect, it was a pleasure to see the 90s style of narration blend beautifully with contemporary aesthetics and sensibilities to form a pakka entertainer. So, steer clear if you don't like that kind of masala in your films. But, make sure you go for it, if intense drama mixed with song and dance entertains you. And while at it do lend a special applause to makers for resisting the urge to use exotic locales and most importantly, slapstick/lame comedy!","A true villain doesn't have any attachments and is pretty much soulless. Why he wants to achieve ALL, no one knows, but that's all he wants - achieve all. The lack of reason instills fear in both his enemies and the audience. Kancha (Sanjay Dutt) is that truly detached villain and Viju (Hrithik Roshan) is trying to get there. Every time he commits a murder, you see a weight of sadness in Viju's eyes, which reminds us that his parents wouldn't approve. That difference is what makes the audience root for Viju while dreading Kancha. And this polarity in emotions for the characters makes Agneepath a watch well-worth the time and money. The only charm of 1990's Agneepath was in watching Vijay Dinanath Chauhan struggle between his father's ideology which became intrinsic to him and how he thought the world really needs to be dealt with; between seeking his mother's, thus the 'good' world's approval and knowing only one way to avenge his father's death. 22 years later, this struggle has been blunted. Yet, the charm has taken new form. His single-minded focus on seeking redemption in revenge takes you through almost t-h-r-e-e hours of watching a film. In this SMS age that, in itself, is a huge achievement. It can be argued that a couple of songs could've been done away with, but that is exactly what Agneepath takes rightly from the 90s style of film-making. Build tension, break tension with some good-sounding music and lyrics, build tension within the said song to keep the story from stalling and let it beak with another intense/action sequence. This tempo worked very well then and from the way it's done here, can live on if used by the right hands. Sure, there is nostalgia hidden there, so I'm really interested in seeing how the generation, which hasn't grown up on that style, reacts. Enter Hrithik Roshan. While his ""star"" value will rope in enough audiences from Gen-X, he's very unlikely to remind the previous generation of Amitabh Bachchan. That won't be because he hasn't done a good job, that he has, but because director, Karan Malhotra's interpretation of Vijay Dinanath Chauhan is so different. So intense is his gaze and so serious his demeanour in his first hour of screen-time that you feel relief and joy when you see him smile. Priyanka Chopra must've known when she signed the film that all she, like her character, Kaali, is required to do is lend support. She plays the simple girl with simple needs role to perfection. The backdrop Kaali grew up in grants enough leeway to make her, cheesy, silly, smitten-in-love character, adorable. Similarly, it's good to see Kancha (Sanjay Dutt) have that slight change to his background which gives him additional motivation to be in love with that particular village. Yet, I wish his character was less dramatic. The madness he represents made him into a caricature and thus a tad bit comical. This stands out even worse because none of the other characters are really cartoon sketches. And we know, with the underworld, drugs and body-trading as a backdrop there is enough scope for mockery. A ready and available character was that played by Rishi Kapoor, Lala. Through most of the film, you forget you are watching one star after another, but when you see Rishi Kapoor beating and being beaten up by Hrithik Roshan, a certain line is crossed and you suddenly realize the intensity of what's going on on-screen. A moment is created, even if it is not the pleasant kind. I also liked the moments that the makers chose to keep from the original like the one with Viju and his mother having dinner or the one when Viju visits Officer Gaitonde's house. Also, some new moments were created like the one where Viju is living his sister's childhood as he would've liked to or the one which he shows intentions of getting married. I admit, these moments might make the movie sappy and a little longer than some would like, but they certainly added to the second dimension of Viju's character - that which makes him likeable despite his mean streak.  Yet, it doesn't mean there were layers to various characters that were fascinating to peel off. A couple of dimensions from each character were chosen and they were given definite shape - enough to keep you engaged. Yet, plugging some holes from the original doesn't mean new ones aren't created. Some things came too easily to Viju and some events needed better explanation. But, today's Agneepath was still a better version for me while retaining a lot of what I loved about the 90s. More importantly, this Agneepath loses the unnecessary comic relief and doesn't glamorize itself with the oh-so opportune exotic locations. Now the question, what about the people who either belong to that 1990-Agneepath cult or have never seen it, so they have nothing to compare it to?

60,Agyaat,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma reviewNotepad20 Critic Reviews 1.1/5.0 15 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/agyaat-review/,1.1/5.0,4/5.0,,2.933333333,"Weird camera angles used wisely, wish background score was used miserly. Nevertheless, the pace and visuals used are well placed to thrill and create curiosity. Alas, the climax is pretty predictable and that takes away a lot from the enjoyment of the film.","One could easily get away with saying that Agyaat has no 'real' story. And they wouldn't be entirely wrong. The one-line description and the detailed description would pretty much be the same. But as the drama in the post-interval 45 minutes unfolds the film shows the struggle of a human being. A struggle between his natural instinct to become an animal for his survival and his persistence in trying to keep himself from turning into a beast. And this is what sets the film apart and keeps it from becoming one big yawn-fest. Also some of the jerks - the kind in a horror film that jolt up in your seat - are done pretty well. Of course, there are other times when all you see is the camera following the subject or being followed by the face of the subject. This though is used in limitation and saves the film from becoming a tiring watch. At last I found the use of nauseating camera angles in an RGV film justifiable. The spookiness he tries to create this time works at least in bits - more so in the second half. Pre-halfway the film is pretty much blah. Nothing much goes on in the story other than set-up of characters. Also there is enough evidence of RGV going bonkers in post-production, especially in the sound department. And yet I wanted the cackling in the audience to stop - I understand it is inevitable when horror is on screen and yet I wanted them to give the film a chance. Also the cliff-hanger at interval shakes you out of the drowsiness immediately. Even until half-time the use of camera will interest people who like observing the technical aspects of film-making. Very smartly the film also gives us a peek into the hardships that the actual crew might have gone through while shooting Agyaat. it felt like you were watching Sri Lanka on the ""Animal Planet"" channel - with some exotic snakes being covered from close quarters. I'm fascinated by flora and fauna so seeing snakes on big screen really excites me. Though the inherent beauty of Sri Lankan jungles doesn't leave much room for creativity, an eerie atmosphere is created. Despite the loud background score's best effort to keep you from being horrified. Not only the music in the background, but the songs are also very obviously fit in the script for pure commercial purposes. Please tell me a skimpily-undressed Nisha Priyanka Kothari is not all it takes to make a film a financial success. Anyway, she does the usual stuff a lead lady is required to do in a ""horror"" film - yell and feel scared - and does it well. That is pretty much what the rest of the cast does too. Like a gym workout. Make the expression required of your character. ""hold-Hold-HOLD AND pulse-Pulse-PULSE AND 8 - 7 - - 4 - "" you get the drift. Right. Also a couple of characters have irritating traits that make them caricatures.  Though a lot of grace marks for keeping dialogue as minimal as possible given it’s a commercial project. Despite that there are a couple of scenes which could have used better dialogues instead of run-down repetition or predictability. I'd have liked a subtle hint of ambient noise to prevail as background sound. I want to know what it feels like in an RGV product. I know Agyaat had more potential to terrify than just this. It created neither warmth for nor curiosity about the characters. But I wanted to know more about the unknown. And that is what makes the end absolutely predictable. Oh well...if RGV could try different tactics to stun, he wouldn't be RGV, right?
