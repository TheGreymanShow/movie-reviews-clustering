0,61,61,61,61,Aik,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review2 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/aik-review/,,4/5.0,,2.933333333,"Intended to be a horror film, Aik is instead a confused muddle. The film is far from scary and is often plain boring. With neither the cast nor the content to make the film appealing to audiences in any way, Aik is one of those films that will probably not see another Friday.","Occasionally startling, mostly boring but never scary, this week’s Marathi release Aik, directed by Pratik Kadam, is a confused mess of a horror film. The hackneyed treatment of the horror scenes apart, the biggest problem that no one involved in its making seems to have any real idea of what their role in the filmmaking process is.A young couple with a child moves into a spacious apartment in Mumbai that comes their way dirt-cheap. Without too much of a thought into why such a large house in Mumbai is being sold so cheap, they move in, but not before a few hints are provided about an existing otherworldly force in the house. From here, the film shifts to the marital problems that the couple is facing. Before long, the film moves to an abandoned palace near Gujarat, where the husband’s TV channel is starting a first-of-its-kind live reality horror show. The story of the film definitely had scope. For instance, one of the interesting things about this film is the nature of the ‘haunting’. The reason behind the haunting is unique, and makes logical sense (to the extent that a film about ghosts can) about why these particular people are being haunted. However, it is hard to give the makers of the film too much credit beyond that, because of the manner in which the film has been treated. Starting from the look of the film to the choice of the lead cast and the techniques used to give the audience the chills, everything only gives the impression that a lot of confusion surrounded the making of the film. Swapnil Jadhav and Aditi Sarangdhar, who play the husband and wife respectively, aren’t bad, but they just don’t look like they can carry a film all by themselves. It is hard to root for them not just because of the manner in which their characters are written, but also because they don’t really suit the characters much. The screenplay meanders around too many issues and side characters, particularly during the reality show bits, distracting from what the main purpose of the film is. It takes too long to start getting scary, having already run out of steam by then. The unconvincing content seems worse because of the technique. Shots are repeated with the hope that no one will notice, the cinematography and colour correction is inconsistent and substandard, and the production design is so poor that it often betrays the fact that the film was clearly being made on a really tight budget.Aik can at best be likened to an ambitious student film. The makers of the film had a thought, and had the will to pull it through. What they didn’t have is the money and the expertise to make it worth the audience’s while.

1,62,62,62,62,Airlift,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma reviewPreview35 Critic Reviews 4.4/5.0 6 Reader Reviews 4/5.0 129 Tweet Reviews 4.9/5.0,/movie/airlift-review/,4.4/5.0,4/5.0,4.9/5.0,4.433333333,A dusty desert wrought with equal measure of humanity and inhumanity. A film that shows you both facets without making much ado about either. Ought to be watched because these 'too good to be true' events are true. ,"Humans for humans. Humans against humans. The story of every war. The story of this world. Airlift brings forth this story without much aplomb. Even if it is not edge-of-the-seat drama, it engages you through the length of the film, despite becoming repetitive. Airlift is the kind of story that will make you go, “What nonsense! Stuff like that happens only in Hindi films!” What a coincidence that Ranjit Katiyal meets seemingly the most important person in Iraq's attack on Kuwait, when he was seconds away from being shot (for fun!) by Iraqi teenage soldiers! How can over 1.7 lakh people roam around a city being bombed without getting into more trouble than they did? To top it all off, how can a shrewd businessman who is politically incorrect for political reasons, cares only about profit, refuses to call himself Indian have a change of heart, just like that? Maybe some of the things happened differently from the way Airlift puts it up. But, what is shown must be somewhat close to reality. And that's what makes Airlift watchable. Sure, there must be thousands of details left out. The story despite being 'too good, yet true' seems to have over-simplified things a bit. Especially, when it comes to the 'don't care' attitude of the bureaucracy. Even so, you are not blind to the fact that all the good happened despite of the Indian political system. Just like the humans who help out in times of tragedy contrast so well with the war-mongers who kill without reason; the handful of cogs in the machinery that make the system contrast well with the other parts wanting to bog the system down. The subtle irony is not to be missed – people, some of whom were happy not to be called Indians, look up to the Indian flag while being saved by the efforts of a handful of people because they thought it was the human (not necessarily Indian) thing to do. Not to mention the nation's leadership seems to be completely missing in action. At least, as far as the film goes. But, scenes like the one with dramatic raising of the Indian flag, or the turning point in Ranjit Katiyal's attitude, or the misplaced songs seem out-of-place compared with the tone of the rest of the film. Thankfully, these are only a few and far between. The rest of the film flows smoothly and is peppered with interesting characters. Much like real life, put together a group of people and you will fine a few cynical ones, a few who are overwhelmed, a few who take charge and a few who are outright annoying. Purab Kohli's Ibrahim is the silent elf, who goes about his business without much ado. Prakash Belawadi's George is one from the irritating category. He will remind you of that one uncle who wouldn't do a thing for any one else but carries a high sense of entitlement to being looked after. This last one added a much-need, close-to-real-life quirk, however it got overdone soon and became repetitive thereafter. However, that doesn't take away from the performances. Not only were Purab Kohli and Prakash Belawadi's performances engaging, those of Akshay Kumar and Nimrat Kaur too. Akshay Kumar is always a pleasure to watch when he is in non-hero mode. Even here, when he gets into a fist-fight, he is a common man reacting to something that got to him. Innamulhaq as the Iraqi major has a very distracting accent though because of which his whole act comes off as over-the-top.Nimrat Kaur, on the other hand, is as convincing as a bored, rich guy's wife as she is as a bickering one and equally as one who stands up for her husband. You can't blame her or even the script if the role called for her to just be a wife, one way or another.  Maybe to counter that she is given a monologue – for her character to seem pertinent and keep Airlift from being a movie with barely any women. Good thing then, that it is directed towards a character who deserves the bashing. But maybe that is why the monologue seems stretched a tad bit, because it seems like it has an ulterior motive.  This holds true of a few other scenes and situations too – a little stretched and repetitive. But fortunately, not enough to hamper the pace of the film too much. The climax seems a little rushed, but that is more about over-simplification than the pace of the film. Yet, Airlift doesn't suffer too bad because of these issues. After all, anything that instills your faith in humanity can suffer only so much because things like pace and length. Especially, because these 'too good to be true' events are true.

2,63,63,63,63,Aisha,Watch when on TV/online,wogma reviewPreview52 Critic Reviews 2.0/5.0 5 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/aisha-review/,2.0/5.0,3/5.0,,3.3,"Aisha has clueless characters breathing fresh air. Sonam Kapoor and Ira Dubey, try to carry this 'by women, for women' film, though it suffers from too plain a story. Director, Rajeshree Ojha has decent intentions but Aisha fumbles and stumbles downhill. ","Should I be happy that Aisha is all about a woman (Sonam Kapoor) and has a capable actor like Abhay Deol play second fiddle? Or should I be disappointed that the only thing Sonam Kapoor's character finds pleasure in doing is to look up a man for every female character to hook up with? Should the director be happy that she managed to achieve the ""Hollywood chick-flick"" effect? Or should she be disappointed only how far she could get? While I could take both sides on each of these issues, I'm sure of two things - I'm certainly happy for the subtle comments made, especially the ones on the battle of the sexes. But I'm equally disappointed that these were done randomly with no connection to story or characterizations thus far. So much so that, all the depth, the film could have taken a plunge into, seems frivolous and flaky. To express exactly where the superficial feel comes from, I can just say that 'look and feel'-wise Aisha had done complete justice to its inspirations - Sex and the City, Hannah Montana, and the likes. Ok, I'm not going to count how many toes I've stepped on, but usually society upward of upper middle class is, by definition, stereotyped by superficiality. That, in itself, takes the characters away a level or two from us. It's not that problems, of people who have moved up in the Maslow's theory of need pyramid, are not genuine problems or should be belittled based on a general moral principle. Who are we to judge that one's problems are more serious than the others'. But, my problem (you are free to judge how important it is) is that films like these trivialize the otherwise weighted issues. It's like taking away from the subject of the film. 
All this analysis might make you think that Aisha has some serious stuff going on. Naah. I'm just commenting on what could have been, especially given the light vein the entire film maintains. Serious issue, subtle humor - rarely fails. But every once in a while a major character in the film does something so totally out of the blue. The shocker is not something that doesn't feel real, it is just that most of us would say or do something like that with some sort of a history and not just because THE writer felt like it. Also, all the trump cards were in the director's hands. It wouldn't come as a shock to anyone if Sonam Kapoor actually lives a lifestyle like Aisha's. Maybe a little less of a meddler, but for most parts she has to behave like a kid who can't be bothered with credit card bills and such. SO, not much acting involved there. Would anyone argue that easy-going, Arjun is a stroll in the park for Abhay Deol? Ira Dubey was a pleasant watch too.It won't come as a surprise if most men will come out flaring at the women who got them in the theater. And many women might find it 'not bad'. At least, they saw some funky costumes. Me? Well, I wanted to love it, but didn't come out hating it either. The picturization of the lovely songs itself were enough to get me by.

3,64,64,64,64,Aiyaary,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewPreview33 Critic Reviews 1.1/5.0 1 Reader Review 5/5.0 102 Tweet Reviews 4.0/5.0,/movie/aiyaary-review/,1.1/5.0,5/5.0,4.0/5.0,3.366666667,A decent thriller with a valid crux that could've engaged much better if it weren’t so slow. You’re left with too much time figure out the loopholes in the twists and turns.  ,"It is to the film’s credit that it manages to keep you hooked despite having one of the lamest starts a thriller could have, and being excruciatingly and unnecessarily slow a little too frequently. The broader story and its core message are interesting.
But for the details, logical gaps and and the speed at which they unfold take away from the film. The audience is asked to make assumptions and accept what’s shown. This would have been fine because thrillers invariably have loopholes. However, decent thrillers jump through the logic at double speed giving you no time to think, unless you ponder over it later. Aiyaary chooses completely avoidable slow motion and long pauses for characters to stare into the distance. The story’s outer shell is about an army officer from a secret team who has gone rogue. At the core though, Aiyaari questions the system. This is hardly the first time that a thriller has asked these questions. But, I thought the manner in which Aiyyari frames this question is insightful and thought-provoking. So what if it is not going to last beyond the 2.5+ hours of the run-time. Even the other details in the writing seem forced. For instance, the constant use of social media platforms in the dialogue, sounded like the writers wanted to come across as tech-savvy. And when a hacker mumbles aloud the steps she’s taking to show that she is an ace programmer, it just sounds ridiculous. I guess we should just be happy that women have actual jobs here. So what, if they leave it all at the drop of a hat, when the script so demands. The script has many such details that sound rather random and there are other spots where details are glaringly missing. What is left then is the overall story arch and that is a good hook. Despite the tardy pace, despite the slack in logic, despite the random details, the larger story is still engaging. While I enjoyed it, I couldn’t help but think how much better it could’ve been if it were 40 minutes shorter. Other than that, the actors all do the drill. The script doesn’t require anything extraordinary from anyone other than Naseeruddin Shah. And for all you know, it could just have been the actor who added that edge to his character. Siddharth Malhotra’s smile gets annoying in its attempt at being cryptic. Manoj Bajpai of course has essayed so many complex characters that this had to be a cakewalk for him. Such is the actor’s repertoire that his earnestness here seems only cute. And then you have the background music that is effective only a couple of times. Otherwise, through the film it has no intention of staying in the background and is in fact, trying too hard to get your attention.Here’s a parting thought. I remember A Wednesday as a crisp, quick film. I wondered if Neeraj Pandey’s films have started getting longer. So, I looked them up  and here is how it goes:Of course, the last one is an exception, but could it be that all these films could have been much better if they were cut short?

4,65,65,65,65,Aiyyaa,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma reviewPreview42 Critic Reviews 1.5/5.0 4 Reader Reviews 0/5.0 18 Tweet Reviews 2.2/5.0,/movie/aiyyaa-review/,1.5/5.0,0/5.0,2.2/5.0,1.85,Where weird goes terribly wrong and comes across as a desperate attempt to become quirky funny. ,"What? Was? That? Again, just to see if I can rid myself of the sense of bewilderment, “What WAS that?” I can understand the need to experiment and add quirk to a love story that is as simple as it gets. But doing it while maintaining the age-old norms of Bollywood, how much ever spoof-like it was meant to be, just didn't work for Aiyyaa. Aiyyaa is slow, long and tries its best to test your patience. I know, I should be giving the film some benefit of doubt because of the projection issues that the screen I saw it in had first in about 40 minutes and then a second one in another 10 minutes, which was after a 20 minute delay to begin, and following which the show was canceled. So, I watched the film all over again at the next show. Yet, I am willing to go out on a limb and say that the sheer absurdity of the last half hour is worth another “WHAT WAS THAT?”Yet, I don't write the film off a 100%, just because of the basic idea. The idea of attraction experienced by a woman because of here sensitivity to smells. Love at first sight has always intrigued me. I have always wondered what ticks. I have always imagined communication through eyes and other senses rather than logic or brain playing a role in this one. And then there was this show on either Discovery or National Geographic that was about how smell plays a major role in how couple interact with each other. And thus the concept that Aiyya uses is fairly engaging as the one line plot. But boy, has director Sachin Kundalkar overdone it. Anyway, he seems to be enamored by the miraculous sense of smell considering his Marathi film Gandha had three shorter stories connected using the theme of smell. But by the time you have seen Rani Mukerji heave while closing her eyes for the 10th time, you've had enough. For want of a better phrase and over-generalising it way too much for my own taste, Aiyyaa carries a heavy dose of Marathi film sensibilities (barring likes of Deool, Natarang, etc)Not that that is the only complaint against Aiyyaa. The loud, forcibly quirky characters that Meenakshi (Rani Mukerji) is destined with as her Marathi family, get on your nerves in the first few minutes. Amey Wagh, Jyoti Subhash, Nirmitee Sawant, Satish Alekar – all well known in the Marathi film industry are made plain weird to add to the whackiness element that the director seems to be shooting at. Well, it was an annoying kind of whacky, not the kind you grow to enjoy. And let me not even get started about Maina's (Anita Date) over-the-top, unfathomable derangement. The mockery of people who don't look normal is used yet once again to bring out a few laughs. Rani Mukerji herself is barely tolerable in general, but is especially far from that too when she does her usual shrieky self in monologues. And couldn't anyone in this heavily Marathi crew point out that just exaggerating the ph, ai, sh while speaking English and punctuating Hindi with 'aiyya' and 'aga bai' does not make for Marathi accent. Moreso, considering that she is a nearly naïve Marathi girl from Pune was the basic theme of the film. Yet, I do commend her for experimenting with this script. It's a risk and it might have failed, but that she took this risk is admirable. Also, she adds to the list of lead ladies bringing size 8-10 back in fashion. Unfortunately, her depiction of the physical attraction a woman experiences comes too late both in her performance and the story/film to add any value other than make the film look even more ludicrous. The juvenile symbolism makes it even more laughable. The climax is another box of weird worms and simplistic Bollywoodization (yeah, yeah spoof-shphoof).I have read the same synopsis at a couple of places to describe Aiyyaa, something that includesBollywood icon Rani Mukerji plays Marathi girl Meenakshi in this delightful 'Amelie'-style comedy.I just hope this isn't the official synopsis. 'Amelie' style? Really? Such comparisons should be left to the audience, shouldn't they? Also, is that what the makers are admitting to? And I guess, I have to add, having loved almost everything Anurag Kashyap has associated himself with, I never thought I'd ever say this to any of his products, “aga, aai ga!” (MUMMY!!)

The rich - both honest and corrupt - can love too, so what if they have money, they have a heart too. Baah! That is what Ajab Gazabb Love harps on. So, we have Madhuri (Nidhi Subbaiah) who carries fancy bags, struts on fancier shoes and has clothes that  seem to be wanting to make a fashion statement claims to hate the rich. If that isn't superficial enough, in a scene later in the film, she refuses to take money from her family while continuing a lavish lifestyle as a sociology student that the same money seems to have bought. If that weren't enough a very rich Rajveer (Jackky Bhagnani) falls for her and HAS to lie that he's poor for she ofcourse, hates the rich. That's how you juice the comedy out of this romantic comedy.You wonder who Ajab Gazabb Love is targetted at. It couldn't be for the economically not-so-well-to-do because all it does through the film is make fun of the poor. Of course, it isn't so directly, it is masked under making fun of rich family who are compelled to behave like they are poor. And all this because of course, the script is all about the hundred other lies to cover that one like that Rajveer initiated.Not one scene is devoid of pretentious melodrama giving the whole film a spoofy feel. A spoof of what, you wonder. Hindi films? Really? If that is the serious intention, it so didn't fit whatever can be called the story. The melodrama is brought to you by some extremely over-the-top acting by the support cast led from the front be Kirron Kher. Darshan Jariwala tries to bring in some calm and Arshad Warsi does make an attempt with a mix of his comic timing and a south Indian accent.Nidhi Subbaiah has an extremely regressive and shallow role to play and she does whatever she can with it. Jackky Bhagnani starts off fine, but soon enough it becomes the run-of-the-mill mush typical of a movie that stereotypes so. However, there was one loud, hearty laugh by what seemed like 100% of the 20 people watching the film when Jackky oh-so-dramatically makes a serious 'sacrifice' dialogue and ends it with the most ridiculously lame line possible. Not that there are too many of other kind of lines. But this one was hilarious because it was so predictable. And of course, your patience with unpredictability is tested when you are subjected to a song out of the blue. The choreography, music and lyrics are as unoriginal as they look in the trailers. You don't really expect too much logic in a film that falls in this genre of rom-com that is intentionally over-the-top. But, you'd think there would be some charming moments between say father and son or mother and son or brother and sister in a film that seems to have so much family in its core story. I guess that's a bit much to expect when there no 'moments' even between the lead couple of this rom-com.

Does that make it a well-baked film? Unfortunately that's not how the math works. It stays an under-cooked pot that makes you laugh here and there and doesn't get you engaged in its emotion,"The on-screen activity had the entire theater in splits! People around me couldn't stop laughing their guts out. So funny did they find the jokes and situations that the gags kept them happy through the unnecessary emotional scenes too. No-no, the audience was chuckling with the characters, not at them. I - well I didn't see the humor through most of the film. Somehow - hit-the-crotch, eunuchs-exist-that's-so-funny, Draupadi-like-undrape-Sari, people-falling-off-stairs, slapping-each-other, modified-cake-fights - don't even make me smile, smirk maybe, but nowhere near the grin-region. However, when I laughed at the other jokes, I laughed real hard.I don't understand what's so weird or whacky about Prem (Ranbir Kapoor) or about his style of love. Nor do I understand what's so unusual about his story. Not a crime so far, even if you claim those things in the title. The onus of originality is not on you when the entire industry is ""referencing."" But get there in a way that is wholesome and entertaining. The sure way of doing that is with some howlarious dialogue, especially when you don't have much in terms of character arcs or story development going on. That they manage in fits and spurts. There is another way to enjoy the do, just pre-decide, you are going to enjoy, and you might too. The lead pair is another thing that might keep you going. Ranbir Kapoor plays the perfect Prem (Barjatya reference for the uninitiated). Charming and saccharine sweet. He has shades of Sunil, who tries to evoke Prem's darker side. Yes, he's aaawww-cho-chwweet. Diabetics might want to stay away. There's this one sequence in which he does a Jim Cary a lá The Mask and is pretty hilarious too. Now, why he's doing that, don’t ask! And oh yeah, remember slapstick? Yes, Ranbir is loud in this one!Boys, Katrina Kaif is as lovely, to look at, as ever - even though she's in Sunday-Morning-Mass dresses through the film. Meaning - not much in terms of sensuous skin-show. She doesn't let that affect her performance though. Same ol' accent, same straight face, a similar ol' attempt at shedding glycerin tears.On the brighter side, there's no first half-second half syndrome here. It is in one continuum - few emotional scenes, a few good laughs, loads of slapstick, and mucho silliness. Oh yeah… and 2-3 songs. The problem is in each of these, you find Santoshi trying to imitate some movie or director. And why not, right? Especially when you can pay tribute to Cinema Paradiso and Maine Pyaar Kiya all in one go! And if not anyone else, there's always an annoying self-reference to bank on. Reminding us of what could have been. It's Tom and Jerry style humor, alright. But, it doesn't have a quarter of the recall value. And the saddest part is that it's a desperate effort for a repeat performance by Rajkumar Santoshi. And that part is pretty obvious. If only being yourself wasn't that difficult. A wannabe Andaz Apna Apna. And not very successful at that.

Following his acting debut last year, the celebrated art director’s debut feature at the helm, Ajintha, hit theatres this week. Ambitious in scale and vision, Ajintha has technique going for it, but falls way short of being even a halfway decent watch, primarily because of its writing and direction.The film opens in the jungles of Ajintha, where a Captain James Smith of the British Army, accompanied with a team of tribals, makes an important discovery – caves over two millennia old, containing carvings and paintings depicting the various incarnations of Lord Buddha. Keen on promoting this discovery, the British decide to send a soldier, who also happens to have some skill with the paintbrush, to recreate the paintings and sculptures, so that they can be exhibited and the caves popularized.Thus, Captain Robert Gill arrives with his easel and canvas to the caves of Ajintha, to create his own version of the masterpieces. With the beauty of his new environment comes Paro, a tribal girl with a sad past, capturing his imagination with her innocence, becoming his muse and the source of his creativity. There is no denying that the premise of the film had a lot of scope. Unfortunately, an unforgivably incoherent screenplay combined with a rather weak directorial hand causes the result to be clumsy, pointless and boring. The dialogue of the film is especially clunky, with a lot of them unintentionally causing a large section of the audience to guffaw uncontrollably. In fact, there was one large stretch in the middle where the audience made me feel like I was watching Vicky Donor again, even though there was nothing remotely funny going on, on screen.Nitin Desai’s wish to make this film indulgent and ‘arty’, if there is such a thing, clearly shows - long circular trolley shots around characters to bring forth their mental turmoil; thin lines between dreams and reality where large sets seem to exist one moment and disappear the next; attempts to bathe characters in shafts of light; the works. Ajintha is virtually a case study of the fact that even decades of being a celebrated technician and being associated with some of the best films and filmmakers in the country doesn’t necessarily give you the ability to direct your own film.If there is someone who brings forth a shred of credibility in the film, it is the young British actor Philip Scott Wallace, who plays Robert Gill. In spite of being saddled with some ungainly English dialogue, he seems to have invested himself into his character of a soldier with artistic leanings, who falls in love with an Indian tribal girl. Sonalee Kulkarni, the actress who plays Paro, is a different matter altogether. Not particularly good with her acting, she doesn’t even come close to looking like what one would imagine a rustic, wild tribal beauty to look like. The problems with Ajintha, then, are pretty elementary really. The film has no graph, no moments that hook you, no real takeaway. Apart from some well-designed and constructed sets, a few beautiful frames and some intriguing background music, Ajintha has very little going for it for it to make a mark either critically or commercially. This one can safely be given a miss.

Yes, I just compared this effort to what is considered an epic of our times. Because it is a valiant effort. If only, it had avoided the trappings of a few clichés.","Akaash Vani starts of as a regular love story and takes its time in establishing itself with sweet nothings. Then it creates such a tricky situation for the protagonist Vani (Nushrat Bharucha) that I daresay, many a Indian young girls find themselves in when it comes to choosing a partner for herself. Again, there is nothing novel at all about the situation, we have seen the dilemma over and over again, in the life of Indian cinema. But, the manner in which Akaash Vani tackles the situation is quite close to reality. If only, that reality was adhered to for a little longer.  If you are expecting a Pyar Ka Punchnama repeat from Akaash Vani, you will be disappointing yourself. Akaash Vaani means serious business and has taken on a very everyday but loaded issue between parents and their young children. The generation gap played out beautifully. Our parents struggled a lot - in their careers, with their finances, in their relationships. But today's generation has moved up the Maslow's hierarchy of needs. What went by as 'normal' with our mothers, is an absolute no-no for us. I am so glad, writer-director Luv Ranjan picked the smaller issues which underline bigger issues, like the man asking for a glass of water from his woman, instead of the very obvious no-nos.Yet, the writing cops out at some instances. It does get a tad preachy and my 'other man' complaint a la Jab We Met stays. Why can't he be a decent, competent, likeable guy? Is it because it is just easier for love to try and win when he's a louse? The other big one which almost slides by is how Vani suddenly takes on her situation head-on. You almost let this one go by because you are rooting so strongly for her. And for this credit goes to Nushrat Bharucha. Her face withers and body droops with her situation from a sparkling, confident kid. Kartikeya Tiwari on the other hand is still ticking because of his puppy face. Whether or not he can act will be told only when he takes on something different from a lover boy. The other actor who gets us involved is Sunny Singh Nijjar as the relentless male chauvinist. A lot about Akaash Vani is courageous. To take up the topic of a love story which faces opposition in this day and age, when such stories are done to death, is brave. To take it on with such a slow pace when Indian films are getting shorter and shorter is an interesting decision, even if I might have been okay with a film that was thirty minutes shorter. To go the serious route after the laughter riot Pyar Ka Punchnama was made out to be is another bold move. And the most beautiful of them all, the one that made the movie for me was that characters didn't do 180 degree turn-arounds in their thoughts and attitudes. For the rest of the mile, there is always a next time.

9,70,70,70,70,Akira,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma reviewPreview32 Critic Reviews 1.6/5.0 2 Reader Reviews 3/5.0 23 Tweet Reviews 3.5/5.0,/movie/akira-review/,1.6/5.0,3/5.0,3.5/5.0,2.7,Fiery thriller that doesn't let you think about anything else. For most parts anyway.,"The protagonist gets into deeper and deeper trouble, and then some more. In many a film, the trouble becomes unsustainable in terms of the story's plausibility. But it has to move on, else it will feel anti-climatic after all that build up. So, the hole is dug deeper still. This is when the audience gives up and stops caring. Akira brings itself to the brink of such a situation, but it sprinkles in some interesting tidbits from real-life that keeps things believable. Almost. Very few films are able to hold interest to an extent that you don't look at your watch wondering, if it is interval/climax time yet. Akira's interval brings you back to the theater from her story. It is not that it is a smooth flowing story. It is a jerky move from Akira's childhood to adulthood, from small town to big city. And of course post-interval, it is a little bit of a struggle for Akira to keep it form becoming incredulous. But the main character is intriguing. She minds her own business and won't take non-sense. She is a loner and takes the consequences on her chin. She doesn't mind standing alone. So starved are we for strong female leads that this is mesmerizing. Would this film have worked as well if the protagonist was a man? It is really difficult to tell. Would the male actor have been able to keep his star persona at bay from the character? Would he be able to stay subtly uninvolved without any signature moves? Would the director have been able to keep the drama away?The story by itself doesn't necessarily need the protagonist to be a woman. This is exactly what works for Akira. The lead lady could have been anyone with a strong will and a stronger mind. And of course, a very strong body. And Sonakshi Sinha plays it like it was any human being with those characteristics. No airs about her character, no privilege for being a woman, no sense of entitlement. Akira, the film, doesn't give Akira, the character advantage for being a woman. No one treats her like a weak person. In fact, the college bully too is a woman. Akira might as well have been a side character from another film. And that is a good thing. There is nothing larger than life about her.Sonakshi Sinha does it just right too. There is no great need for her to showcase different emotions in Akira. She is a confident, strong-headed woman who know how to throw in a kick. Her medication-induced disorientation works well too. We could complain that in some sense her character is flavorless. But, it is better fewer shades to her character than to have her break into song and dance, on the beat, every 20 minutes. Yes, there is no extraneous stuff like a romantic track or song and dance. Which is why, as much in the background as it was, the family angle felt out of place. Chopping some of it off, would have made the film crisp. And anyway, just Akira and ACP Rane are enough. Anurag Kashyap as a devious, manipulative police officer has a menacing screen presence. He's dangerous and soulless. Again, there are no shades to his character. And again, it is better than him becoming into a caricature of a villain. It is amusing that his character, ACP Rane can spin a yarn in the blink of an eye. Like the story-teller in Anurag Kashyap in real life? The film nods at other realities of  life with amusement too, like equipment and vehicles used by police officers. Or its remark on a system where an acid attacker gets away because he is connected but an acid attack defender serves time and is marked for life. However, as the film progresses it becomes less and less believable - both the cover-ups and the exposé. Fortunately, by then you are rooting hard for the protagonist. And then things are wrapped up, even if in a hurry – just before they are let loose uncontrollably out of the realm of reality. Akira is no fairy tale. There are no charming princes and no fairy god mothers. Sure, there is a warrior princess and the devil. Their fight is enough to keep us absorbed. They fight long and hard. Maybe a tad too long. The usual trappings of the second-half syndrome however, are just about tolerable to make Akira absorbing enough to stay in memory after the walk out of the theater.

Yeah-yeah-yeah, it's the same ol' story, same ol' chosen one saving the world. But it's done very well visually. If only some more energy was spent on the writing.","You could call it the Hindi Harry Potter 7-crushed into-1 with a dash of X-men thrown in. Or, for that matter, you can look at it as any other super-hero story. BUT, you could also think of Aladin as a huge step forward for Hindi films in terms of graphics and cute imagination - however small it might be. Don't expect any sort of deviation from the writing department though. Oops! Did I just give the movie away? Oh well, not like you wouldn't guess that in the first 5 minutes. Also, you still don't know how a dim-wit like Aladin (Riteish Deshmukh) manages to keep the evil forces from taking over. There are no fascinating revelations about life and human behavior. There are no aims loftier than power. I don't know about you? But, I thought Aladin was all about adventures, but this is more like a love story. The first thing that takes you by awe in the first 15-20 minutes or so is the lovely sets. The sand-colored stones, the fortress like look is done really well and you know you are in fairly land with spurts of color showing up on the screen. You are in this town that is more-or-less nameless and is not bound in time. You will see TVs but they have wood-finished remote controls. You have the milkman's cycle and vintage cars. The other special effects are also fascinating. I wondered if it was just because I was seeing this in a Hindi film. And the answer was a resounding NO! I would have equally appreciated it in a film from any part of the world. The action sequences are smoothly cut and put together. The camera moves lyrically and somehow never gets me out of the story book. Unfortunately, there's nothing else that's above the average here. I shouldn't be repeating too often that the story is oft-repeated. :) Not only that, it slacks down quite a bit after the first half hour. Also there are jumps in the story that make you feel like you are watching a movie based on a book and they lost 50 pages after every 50 pages. The intriguing suspense in the beginning is not built further and is sorted-out pretty disappointingly. The acting I guess requires everyone to behave a little over-the-top. I'm not the loud-act-makes-me-laugh audience, so I wouldn't know if the people who like that would enjoy it. I just think it’s a lame excuse in the name of appealing to the kids. We should be developing better tastes in the next generation. But, given that they are supposed to act loud and larger-than-life Amitabh Bachchan and Sanjay Dutt enchant. We knew they are capable of it, and we see it again. Oh, how my heart sinks in giving a movie starring the Big B a low rating. You want to look only at this 65-year in a screen full of dancers. How he pulls off an entire song and makes elegant, the simplest of choreography … sigh oh well…Riteish Deshmukh too succeeds, what looks like effortlessly, in playing the larger-than-life idiot! Some of the scenes with two Aladin's on screen (just like that!) make you respect him even more as an actor. Even if those were the only two expressions he could hold. And what's so special about Jacqueline Fernandez, again? Not her chalk-white face with whiter make-up, right? And those songs get one too many and thus way too often and spoil that for you too! For those who are not into Hollywood, this one is a must-must-watch! Others could say, ""baah! I've seen it in Hollywood - like 100 times over."" Or you could watch it like you would watch the next Holly-thriller-action-superhero movie with a typical No-one-can-save-the-world-but-me plotline. And yet, if there were a sequel, I would look forward to it, because all hope's not lost.

11,72,72,72,72,Alice In wonderland,Owner's Pride!,wogma review5 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/alice-wonderland-review/,,4/5.0,,2.833333333,You might actually be surprised to know that Alice in Wonderland is probably not for kids. Tim Burton adapts this classic tale and takes you down the rabbit hole where you went as a kid. That world however is dystopic and almost without hope. Alice is destined to change that… and her self. ,"When I entered the movie hall to watch Alice in Wonderland, the entire row behind me had children presumably between the ages of 3 and 14. By the time I turned around during the interval most of them had left the auditorium and most of the others who were left behind were somewhat bored. It seems that the book I read as a child was made into a film that wasn’t necessarily for children. Of course the book itself had far too many socio-political implications that I was to learn of much later in my life. But Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland unapologetically reflects the cold dystopia we live in. As a matter of fact it does so in an exaggerated fashion that leaves you somewhat out of sorts when you leave the theatre.Burton moves away quite a bit from the original plot of Lewis Caroll’s classic tale. It follows a 19-year-old Alice who returns to the magical place (called Underland) only to be told that her true destiny is to kill Jabberwock a fierce creature and end the rein of the Red Queen.Tim Burton makes Alice out to be some sort of a champion on whose decision the fate of ‘Underland’ rests. Tired of being told what she should do, not wear and who she should marry Alice (Mia Wasikowska) follows the White Rabbit (voice of Michael Sheen) down the rabbit hole and finds herself in the company of Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas with a little help from animation guys), the Cheshire Cat (voice of Stephen Fry), the Dormouse (voice of Barbara Windsor) and the March Hare (voice of Paul Whitehouse) among others. Leading this insane menagerie of course is the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), who is convinced (unlike others) that Alice is the one who can save Underland from the tyranny of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and restore the throne to the rightful White Queen (Anne Hathaway).It seems to me however that Tim Burton’s Alice is in more ways closer to Dorothy from Wizard of Oz than she is to Caroll’s heroine. Burton’s Alice tumbles into the rabbit hole from Victorian England just like Dorothy flew out of Kansas and landed in the wondrous Land of Oz. Both ladies have friends who help them out and vice versa. They also seek to restore a sense of order in the world they have landed in somewhat unknowingly and are somewhat changed persons when they return to their ‘home’.Burton manages to create a stunning alternative reality that draws Alice as well as us into it. The painstakingly created Underland might be a far more dystopic world than we live in. But, it is perhaps the insanity that is endearing than the staid and ‘unhappening’ apolitical times of today.In all likelihood, Tim Burton will get an Oscar nomination as will Depp, who steps into the hat of Mad Hatter as if it was his own. Mia who plays Alice does an endearing job of it and emerges unscathed despite the presence of the talented and eclectic Johnny Depp.The tight screenplay ensures that you are on the edge of your seat from the first frame itself. And even though it does drift more towards the clichéd side towards the end, it does hold your attention largely because of the implications of the scenes and the quick-witted dialogues.I could possibly go on about the symbolism in the movie (the most striking of it being the Red Queen and the White Queen obviously referring to communism and capitalism). But I won’t take the fun away and rather you figure it out for yourself. I would however tell you that Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland made me stop and think. It brought about the realisation that the one thing most of us lose when as we grow up is, as Mad Hatter would say, our ‘muchness’. It also reminded me that it was certainly good practice to believe in ‘at least six impossible things before breakfast’. But most importantly it told me that the best way to travel is not by train or car but rather by a hat.

It is a courageous film even. The film does some things really well. But, it isn't necessarily an absorbing one. ","Have you ever put your favorite music on, hummed along with it, and entered the world that the melodies have created for you? Have you swayed your fingers and tapped your feet to the rhythm? So does Prof. Siras. Prof. Siras is also gay. Why do you need to know that? How is it relevant? It is not. And that is the point that Aligarh tries to make. They are human and the differences between them and other humans are nothing to create hue and cry about. However, can you really not do that without doing it? Can you say something is not worth giving undue attention to without bringing attention to it? And that is a trap that Aligarh falls into. Why try so hard to keep away from something that all you can do is get drawn to it? In this case – not becoming a gay rights activism story. Aligarh tries to be about 'gay professor suspended' with focus on the 'professor', the person rather than the 'gay' part. This by itself is commendable because thus far Hindi films have either turned homosexuality into mockery or taken it too seriously. Aligarh tries its best to let homosexuality just be. That itself is worth a few rounds of applause.However then, you have the romantic pauses which stay long enough to become over-romanticised. Again, attention is drawn to them, almost as if saying, “if we don't say it, you will miss the subtlety.” Aah..the irony. Is it good because it is better than a joke being explained in a slapstick comedy? This once Hansal Mehta adds a touch of humor and lightness to the subject too. The hookah-smoking 'aunty' and the quirkiness that she brings along. The energy that comes with Deepu (Rajkummar Rao). Almost as if in response to feedback – your films are too serious. I am joking. The fact that the youth can make a difference if they care enough while living their lives comes through clearly. This even for matters that aren't relevant to them directly. Rajkummar Rao does brilliantly to bring this through too. His performance is almost taken for granted because of the meek and subdued character Manoj Bajpai plays with such elegance. You know the blushing, nervous, anxious, angry, lonely facets of boring Prof. Siras because - Manoj Bajpai. Even so, the film becomes stagnant after a while. It is not because of lack of action, because the case is interesting. It is not because of the lingering pauses, because the pace is set from frame one and you know it is going to be a lot about silences. It is about some decisions that didn't quite work. For example, was it important to have brought out Deepu's sexual orientation? It is also about repetitions. Sure, the same sequence is shown with a little additional information. But, that extra isn't weighty enough to warrant a repetition making the film seem stagnant. It is an important film. It is a courageous film even. The film does some things really well. But, it isn't necessarily an absorbing one.

","I am sure I have mentioned my dislike for film marketing gimmicks like item numbers and closing credit songs. The best thing about All Is Well is the closing credit “shanivar” song and Sonakshi Sinha's “farrata” item number. That and sympathy for the actors are the two things I took from the film. Yes, that bad. My heart weeps for Abhishek Bachchan. Has it come down to this? For now, I have convinced myself that this is the Ajooba and Jaadugar phase of his career, while being cognizant that he hasn't had his Sholay or Janzeer. Because he is a good actor. Even in a badly written film like this he shows great restraint. He might not be the best fit to play a rockstar, yet his fake nonchalance towards his love interest is pretty believable. Anyway, point being, that is the thing I left the film with – feeling bad for Abhishek Bachchan. Of course, my heart wept for Rishi Kapoor and Supriya Pathak too. But somehow, we've seen them in better films in the last few years. Maybe this one worked out best for Asin – as reminder to the audience that she still exists. In the form of story, we have a sour parent-child relationship.  A full of himself dad and a thankless son make the perfect combination. But, they are too loud and they bicker – All. The. Time. The characters are pretty much insufferable. Not to mention, the movie tries way too hard to be funny and wraps it up with a sermon on importance of family. Doesn't work one bit. As I mentally go through all the departments of film-making wondering if a comment is worth the readers' time and mine, I come back to the same – two foot-tapping songs and deep sorrow for the actors.

The regular elements of a typical slapstick coexist and as always, don't entertain.","Sometime earlier this week, a friend suggested that all I'd need to do for the review of All the Best is to copy-paste the review of Golmaal Returns. I laughed it off then. On Diwali-eve, I'm so tempted to use that suggestion as really well-meaning and useful advice. But, non-plagiarizers that we are, here you go. (And if don't care for the details, the rating says it all. Golmaal Returns is not recommended and neither is All The Best.)There are these two buffoons who are the creative types, so they obviously can't earn for themselves - Prem, Prem Chopra (Ajay Devgan) and Veer (Fardeen Khan). But they have expensive tastes and style of living. So, of course they beg, borrow, AND steal. And lie, lie to cover that lie and so on. And of course, a successful business tycoon, more gullible than the average nincompoop, Dharam (Sanjay Dutt) completes the circle. Yeah, that's the kind of ""plot"" we are looking at. (Of course, you can choose not to look at it, I didn't.) Add to it the endless stream of caricatured characters who add to the commotion. But, there is this razor-thin silver lining to this dark cloud - there are a few good one liners every once in a while. And they are delivered pretty subtly, especially in comparison to the rest of the movie. The understated tone in which the lines just come make them funnier too. But they are only few and not worth spending those extra calories you've put on this festive season. Enjoy the extra weight, seriously. Nothing else is subtle about the rest of the show though. The acting is loud and the background music is louder. And when that's deemed ""not enough"" there is this shriek-track played in addition to the background score. Supposedly to make us laugh or NOT! There isn't anything stylish or cool or worth-watching about the actors' appearances either. The women are wearing the lousiest of outfits and are made up way too much. The men are in their usual slapsticky mode, cracking a few toilet jokes, a few innuendoes and the occasional witty line. So mundane is that there is no amount of oomph their presence could add. Not that they are the best lookers in the industry anyway. A lot of older films are referred to. Maybe they are supposed to be tributes. But looked more like insults both in the way they were used AND because the film that's paying a tribute also needs to be of a certain basic quality to consider itself worthy of paying that tribute, right? There is this slight comment on undying friendship and the extent to which the best of friends can go to save each others' skin. And there are a couple very sweet moments between Ajay Devgan and his screen partner Bipasha Basu. The fact that they worked for me despite coming towards the end of a tiring film, means all the contributors to those shots did their job really well. If only there were more of those.Yes, guys, go watch that diya burn. Your Diwali will be happier by avoiding this one.

There's more of the same. With a slight difference that's not completely new, but some thought nevertheless. That's not enough though. You are left a spectator and are not riding along with anyone in particular. ","The ""revenge is futile"" concept is as new as the next ""boy meets girl"" plot. Moreso, when it's set in a Mumbai slum. But that in combination with the ""ganglord wants to mend his ways"" has enough meat to make a film if it is treated with finesse. Allah Ke Bande starts on its way there, but gets lost in trying to stylize and dramatize. A couple of very interesting plot points lose out because the writer/director don't know where to focus.The writing also suffers from the usual pace issues. One half slow, other half desperately trying to catch up. I understand the set-up is necessary for us to feel for the characters, but here it didn’t matter. The second half could very well have been a different film. None of the characters introduced in the first half have anything to do post-interval (yeah-yeah, except the protagonists!) Sharman Joshi is the cool, calculative planner, Vijay and Faruk Kabir is the impulsive executor, Yakub. Though there were times when Yakub doesn't follow plans and Vijay does most of the execution. But there's no serious, unfathomable deviation from initial set-up. Sharman does a very good mix of tense, disappointed, rebellious, romantic. Faruk on the other hand is very repulsive. This is intentional in all likelihood, but it gets overbearing and boring to see him on screen. Oh yeah, and the boys who play young Vijay and Yakub didn't work for me one bit. Their fuming seems superficial and their wigs serve as an unpleasant distraction. And despite the two doing exactly what is need of their characters, they fail to engage you. How is it possible when you are not privy to their plans? If I just see the execution, all I end up saying is ""a shootout is a shootout is a shootout"" and ""a chase is a chase is a chase."" What's the point if I don't care whether or not the chaser is caught and who is being killed in a shootout? There are soft moments and a couple of thought-provoking dilemmas. Mostly evoked by Atul Kulkarni's character, masterji (the school teacher). That's the situation, not the performance. This role is nothing close to what our man is capable of. The other moments are allowed by Anjana Sukhani's character, Sandhya. Sure, this is just another case of the woman being used as a prop, but Sandhya had shades of Parveen Babi's Anita in Deewar. There are many more smaller characters, but none that stick with you except for Naseeruddin Shah's performance as a warden. He has an impact on your nerves when he's on screen but after having seen the whole film, that role just looks like it was there for that one brutal scene in the jail. Allah Ke Bande's attempt at showing the inhuman conditions prevalent in such ""homes"". It tries to show how much harm these homes do instead of teaching the children a better way of living. It doesn't want to take a risk and keeps itself from getting too dark.A movie about crime usually has very little new to say. Allah Ke Bande tries real hard. You can't say it succeeded, if after seeing all the difficulties the protagonists go through, you feel, they get it all too easy. Are too many movies on the subject desensitizing us?

Keeps that smile on the face throughout. But doesn't offer a laughter fest.,"The déjà vu feeling makes you uneasy as you see the ""Amerika-returned"" boy look for a suitable match in India. The set-up that you must have seen umpteen number of times in various movies touching upon the issue. And unexpectedly, the clichéd setting of an arranged marriage meeting changes into a quirky comic situation. The smile that starts at that point stays on until after you've left the theater. Sure there aren't any laugh-your-guts-out moments but there are many sweet comic moments and a few idiosyncratic elements that render a light and yet complex texture to the story. Very cleverly Aloo Chat salutes the alternative to eloping - a trend set by Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Intermittently, it also reminds you of the number of Hrishikesh Mukherjee/Basu Chatterjee films set in middle class families. Though it is a good start towards being one of them, it doesn't come close to becoming one. The Mukherjee and Chatterjee films had a knack of making the most improbable situations seem real. Here a possibly real situation seems contrived. And yet you are reminded of films like Chupke Chupke, Bawarchee and Hamari Bahu Alka.The story is sprinkled with interesting characters. From Nikhil's (Aftab Shivdasani's) resentful dad to his suspicious maternal uncle, Chaddami to his tolerant grandmother to the street-side chaat vendor - each one was given lines that added to their personality. There is something very refreshing about Chaddami who is supposedly a fool everyone loves to put down but is actually the most observant of them all. The cast is not outstanding because it is still caricature-like and the film does tend to slip into slapstick mode every once in a while. But, they all do a good job of making us smile with their timing and the specific style of dialogue delivery assigned to each one of them. There is also this underlying element of putting things in perspective or emphasizing the fact that 'everything is relative'. This is done through the story and not explicitly verbalized. Sure, the film goes into preachy mode only for about two sentences towards the end. But that's hardly anything to complain about. 
It is ultimately a clean comedy that doesn't even pretend to make you laugh out loud. Neither does it try to be a technically brilliant product. They just want you to grin and smirk and think about a socially relevant issue. And achieve that, they do.

They come around every Diwali, banking on their previous year’s success, and each year the movies get worse. Chipwrecked is no different, if anything it’s more annoying, unbearable and I would say meant for kids, but even your kids can do better. ","Squeak. Squeaaaaak. I could save you the trouble of watching this movie (and forgive me for summing up a review in one sentence – but PLEASE don’t) by letting you know that Alvin and The Chipmunks: Chip wrecked is only about the squeaking. The third part to a decent first movie (Alvin and the Chipmunks), Chipwrecked takes on pop culture references of Cast Away and Lost, while it shows Alvin, his chipmunks and their female doppelgangers getting stranded on the island of Dr. Cliche, after creating havoc on a luxury cruise. The chipmunks are, at best, ignorable. They could be cute if they would just tone down the squeaks, but then why would they?Chipwrecked then moves through a slapstick adventure, churning out chipmunk-ish versions of hit songs (Destiny’s Child, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga). It’s one song after another and one slapstick joke after another. With no binding ingredient. It’s almost like buffering YouTube videos in a row. Seriously, there’s nothing more to the story – I almost wish I had more to write.What you get however, is a series of annoying, helium-voiced sequences by writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger
(Of Kung Fu Panda fame). Essentially, Chipwrecked is a lazy and dumb attempt to repeat its winning performance at the box-office. While, in the 1950, the Chipmunks were more known for as cartoon-based band that only released helium versions of popular songs. I’d want to write about how children should be given better options for a festive season movie, but as much as I hate to admit, this is the perfect movie for children to watch. With a large tub of popcorn, they can continue to revel in loud, bratty behavior (so let’s just say if your child isn’t bratty, don’t take him/her for this). If you’re an adult however, and you’re in a movie theatre having to bear through this film, you can be grateful that it’s only 87 minutes long. Alvin and The Chipmunks: Chip wrecked is formulaic, predictable, crass and extremely obvious with its in-film branding (Carnival Cruise Line). It’s like the producers of the film sat down one evening and decided on how to channel the money that was coming in – and put crucial cinematic elements like plot and character-relationships. Take your kids for a picnic instead, or for a weekend getaway. Or just sit at home and watch How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, and you’d be better off.

And we are bored of the sermons. So, what do we do? Go to the theater and have 18-year old non-actors preach to us how we shouldn't nag our children. Oh wait, and just in case you didn't get the point, THE Shah Rukh Khan, will come and patronize the same pill down your throat. ","Late teens. Most of us are old enough to get nostalgic about them. We had a tough time. We obeyed. We rebelled. Always Kabhi Kabhi picks four of us and tells our story. Or rather tries to. Because, for our stories to make it to films, they need to be exaggerated. And the hyperbole goes wary because it makes the same mistake our parents made or we as parents might make. Nag, rant, berate. The set-up, the problems chosen, the build-up weren't bad at all. From the over-attentive, selfish parent to the perennially disappointed dad to the missing-in-action socialite-parents - they have it all covered. But the second half takes you into a drastic overdo of either silly lover's tiffs or situations that are beyond unreasonable. To top it off, we have lame dialogue and amateurish delivery. I liked Zoa Morani the best. She was the only one who carried off the attitude assigned to her - ""whatever"".  The two boys, Ali Fazal and Satyajeet Dubey are just about tolerable. Though it might be my intolerance of chocolate-boy-looks and pretentious cuteness coming through here. Same goes for Giselle Monteiro. But at least her character came across as believable. The lasting impact though is of only ""blah"". It doesn't remain the chick-flick it starts out as, nor does it execute the message it wants to put across well. A similar point was much, much better executed in F.A.L.T.U. That each of us has a right to our own dreams. That just because one generation liked Shakespeare, doesn't mean generations and generations later he still has to be played out in the same vein. But what a ridiculous cop-out they chose to go with!?Maybe all of this would have worked if they showed, and didn't tell. And then just for good measure, have King Khan spell it out to us again in the end credits. I guess, we should thank him and our stars, that he didn't show up as one of the 18-year olds.

Delightful and easy watch!","So, after weeks of looking for interesting films to watch, I discovered this one on Netflix. It immediately caught my attention not only because of the smart tweak to the original title--Amar, Akbar, Anthony--but also because of the cover picture which, to me, promised a more mature and inapprehensive, perhaps metrosexual, approach to depicting male bonding. Even if mildly goofy, there is an endearing quality to this picture. Here, two adult male friends can be so close that a peck on the cheek is neither offensive nor out of place. And, when they address each other as ""bruv"" in the movie, you know it is not merely an informal way of calling another guy. It is deeper than that. There is an unshakeable sincerity to it, which comes only with the bonding that's been slow-cooked over time.Amar, Akbar & Tony are not long lost brothers, who discover their blood ties much later in life. Instead, they are childhood friends, who have grown up together in a desi neighborhood of London. The film is about their adult years.At the beginning you are not sure where the movie will be headed, how similar or dissimilar will it be to Amar Akbar Anthony and so on, but soon a serious, heavy-duty event occurs that sets the tone and approach completely apart. The event invites much change to the lives of characters. And Amar, Akbar & Tony then becomes a movie about life's tragedies. And, each character has a little tragedy to face. However, the film has a positive tone to it: 'the events that shake us, also make us' sort of tone.It is a film about Indians abroad, but unlike many other films that have relied upon the talents of stalwarts like Shabana Azmi, Om Puri, Anupam Kher, etc, the film chooses UK based actors, who are low on drama,  but high on contextual belongingness, and thus bring authenticity to their parts. Although, acting talents differ. The men, including the Papaji and Chachaji, surprisingly, are more important here, both in terms of what role they have to play and how they play it. The relationship of Papaji and Chachaji with the younger boys creates interesting subplots.The women, well, they are important too, but only those that are chased by the three guys for romantic purposes. Mothers don't have much role to play. They are reduced to stereotypes: paratha serving moms to vigilante moms on a mission to protect daughter's virginity. But then it is a film about male bonding, so guess, men should rightfully take the center stage.I adored the film because it offered me a less glitzy, more real version of London's desi world than we are used to seeing in Karan Johar's films. There are girls and nightclubs, but not fairy tale versions of them. There are Punjabis, but those who are more practical - not those who lecture on love for India or philosophize on family and friendship.I adored it also for its main leads, they have acted well; the story, how complications arise, how they are resolved; and the very premise, akin to Amar, Akbar & Anthony but developed with an altogether foreign sensibility, pun intended.But I must not close before crediting camerawork in certain scenes. Those scenes make you take the film very seriously. I must also thank the writer for dialogues that are plain yet profound. The film is full of one-liners that at once ring a bell and make the characters so relatable.Amar, Akbar & Tony is cute (not macho), unpretentious, titillating and touching. Delightful and easy watch!

20,81,81,81,81,[The] Amazing Spider-Man,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review2 Reader Reviews 4/5.0,/movie/amazing-spider-man-review/,,4/5.0,,3.0,"Director Marc Webb wasn’t the conventional option for big-budget The Amazing Spider-Man, with his indie-film and music video background. However, he brings to the film an emotional and comic sentimentality that allows one to walk with Andrew Garfield, as Peter Parker, through his journey. You laugh with him, have a lump in your throat as he cries and sit on the edge during his action sequences. This makes The Amazing Spider-Man a novel and stirring viewing experience inspite of the storyline being more or less the same. ","For those of you who still remember Sam Raini’s Spiderman trilogy vividly, (considering the last film was out barely 5 years ago) Marc Webb’s The Amazing Spider-Man (director of well-acclaimed indie film 500 Days of Summer) might not have anything new to offer in the larger picture. But don’t we all love superhero films for its portrayal of the underdog-nerd who turns into a crime-fighter? While The Amazing Spider-Man doesn’t toy with the basic graph of the film, it has enough to grab your attention and ensure a thrilling, enjoyable viewing experience.The story is more or less the same: Of a gawky-lanky Peter Parker as he discovers that he is meant for greater things. After many years of questioning his parent’s mysterious disappearance, we are shown his warm surroundings with Uncle Ben and Aunt May (played by the charming Martin Sheen and Sally Field). He then encounters his father’s former partner Dr Curt Connor’s (Rhys Ifans) genius genetic research and lends a missing algorithm to complete the research.By then he’s already been bitten by the spider, and is trying to grapple with his superpowers. He’s also going through a teenage puppy infatuation with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Their chemistry is much more developed and crackling, which is a vast difference from the sense of achievement that you feel with Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst’s (from previous Spiderman films) heart-warming union. It works, regardless of the differences, because of their performances. Emma Stone is sparkling and plays the kind of girl that young boys write sonnets about (or at least the poetically inclined ones). It makes their coming together that much more magical because their chemistry has a solid build up, devoid of any meant-to-be-together undertones. Rhys Ifans as the Lizard is menacing; although you recognize the need for a more sinister villain. The scenes between Spiderman and the lizard are visually gripping though, mostly due to John Schwatrzman’s swift cinematography and James Horner’s grand-crescendo type background score.Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker is a more nervy, nerdy teenager which works extremely well in this re-telling because the film becomes a coming of age story more than anything. While he’s not a spectacled, dorky nerd, he plays the part of an outsider (the kind that prefers his skateboard to actual human company) with precision. It’s the kind of performance where you’re nearly expecting him to collapse with the pressure he attains after successfully transforming into Spiderman, but you know his sense of responsibility is large (You don’t miss the iconic line, “With great power comes great responsibility”, and that is a big win for writers James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves)The Amazing Spider-Man works, mostly because of the minor nuances that have been paid attention to, to make for a fresh viewing. Be it in Parker and Gwen Stacy’s smile-inducing chemistry, a brief viewing of Parker’s parents, the homemade costume and the fact that the spider-web in this film is web-made as opposed to the organic web from Raini’s Spiderman - all only add to the charm of the film. You’re able to watch the film without making compulsive comparisons to the earlier films and you’re able to love it all the same. For that reason, The Amazing Spider-Man is a must watch.

Still, there's some fun to be had if you don't mind a lot of romance and backstory along the way.","Wait, another Spiderman film is back already? Well, yes it is. The sequel to the reboot of the adaptation is in theatres, and it is as winded as this sentence. When the fortuitously named Marc Webb helmed the first film of this series, one felt that Spidey was in safe hands. With this film, you won't change your mind just yet, but no one will judge you if you pause for a quick rethink. Heavy on romance, pauses and nothingness, but also sprinkled with some amount of action (not to mention tongue-in-cheek humour), The Amazing Spiderman 2 continues in the same vein as its predecessor, which essentially means that it will entertain a few, bore some others, and leave the rest waiting for the next big Marvel film (X-Men: Days of Future Past, which is just around the corner!)Interestingly enough, that firecracker of a lady, Emma Stone, is the best thing about this enterprise, as she lights up the screen with her Gwen Stacy everytime she shows up. She more than makes up for a rather rough-around-the-edges Andrew Garfield, who seems in his element only in the Spandex Spidey suit, where you can't see him emote anyway. In fact, considering how much time Marc Webb spends on the Gwen-Peter romance in this film, you almost wonder if he was making a film called, say, 500 Days of Gwen.That isn't to say that the romance isn't sweet; it quite is. Still, you spend way too much time waiting for Electro (and the Green Goblin; and Rhino) to show up, and when they do, you're served with action that isn't quite as imaginative as you'd have hoped. True, Spiderman has clearly gotten the hang of webslinging now that he's into his second film, but you can't just resort to showing cars stopping mid-air just above an innocent victim's head all the time.  Electro's backstory is treated with kindergarten naiveté, and is another subplot that is devoted longer screen time than it deserved. When he does eventually show up, he does the bright and shiny things you expect him to do, set to an unusually screeching background score. The action set-pieces between him and Spiderman are more fun for the chemistry between the characters, than for any actual brilliance in execution.What you're left with are a few periodic smart-ass one liners from Spiderman, and a gut-wrenching climax; albeit one which fans of the Spiderman comics would have been expecting anyway. Expectedly, tantalising hints about the villains in future films are present in this one.What it boils down to, then, is this: Like the first film, this one too has Spiderman play out a scene with a little boy. The point of these scenes, I suppose, is to bring out the hope that Spiderman instills into the hearts of those who believe. It is that hope that will have people waiting for the next film with equal eagerness. There isn't much of that hope that this current film can stake claim over, though.

22,83,83,83,83,Amelia,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review3 Reader Reviews 2/5.0,/movie/amelia-review/,,2/5.0,,2.0,"Mira Nair’s Amelia, met an unfortunate fate at the box-office, despite being a story about a very interesting character from history. A story of Amelia Earheart, the first American woman pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic and who in her attempt to circumnavigate the world, lost radio contact and went missing somewhere over the Pacific Ocean, never to be found again. When I was in school, I’d learnt that she was a really great woman. This film doesn’t develop that sense of awe about her. It barely skims at the surface of her life, her marriage, her flying expeditions and her extra marital affair and fails to go any deeper.","The DVD of Amelia, is a bit of a surprise. Despite featuring an award winning starcast, an acclaimed director (Monsoon Wedding, The Namesake) and a biopic about a historical figure - a category that’s a soft spot for critics - this film has no blurbs on its front or back cover. Not a single one. No stars, no ratings or recommendations from any film reviewers. At first, I thought it was a layout faux pas - maybe they forgot to add those. To be sure, I then remembered how something was amiss when the film released theatrically in India. There was hardly any buzz in the media, no celebratory coverage considering Mira Nair helmed this big Hollywood project. There’s two-time Oscar winning actress Hillary Swank in the title role of Amelia Earheart, Richard Gere plays George Putnam, her manager and husband, and Ewan McGregor is Gene Vidal, her lover. But the consensus amongst reviewers and audiences has been common - this film could have been so much better.After having seen the film on DVD, I think that opinion isn’t entirely wrong. But considering the amount of trash that Hollywood throws up on screen most of the time, I think Amelia, is still fairly watchable. The screenwriters must have obviously come across too much literature that already exists - three books are credited for the adaptation - about the first woman pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic, who disappeared somewhere over the Pacific ocean on a trip attempting to circumnavigate the world.It’s a dilemma that even the writers of the Harry Potter franchise face in every film: How to pack it all into a two-hour film? But Earheart’s biopic is no spell-binding special effects bonanza. Sure, there are some spectacular aerial shots of her plane crossing continents - fondly recollecting the journey of her life. It only touches the skeleton of Amelia Earheart, hardly managing to get into her soul and depict what a head-strong woman she was to be able to convince a male-dominated society about determination to fly. Solo.This film makes it appear that the task must not have been that difficult, given Putnam’s (Gere) support. He is  a master strategist, a publisher who always seems to be cracking deals, using her name, appearance and knowledge wonderfully to create intellectual property, resulting in wealth for the two of them. There is rarely a scene that makes you go ‘Wow, what a woman she was!’, when the truth is that she was indeed a woman who’s achievements and characters did make Americans go ‘Wow’.Gene Vidal (McGregor) has a role which is rather forgettable - he mouths about 7-8 lines in the film and one would have wanted to see so much more of him. Gere (Putnam) plays the loyal husband well, but there is very little chemistry between him and Amelia. Before they get married, their romance seems rushed and although Putnam is devoted, one is not clear whether its a marriage of convenience since he realises she is the hen that lays golden eggs, or he genuinely has fallen in love with her.Hillary Swank puts in a sincere effort and her Kansas twang, coupled with her make-up give some authenticity and weight to the real persona of Earheart. Much like the aeroplanes she flies in the film, she glides through her role with ease. The character is sought after, but the performance isn’t.Despite its shortcomings, I did feel a sense of pride that this is Mira Nair’s film. I’d put little fault on her - it is the writing that lets her down. The film has some high points, the climax being one of them. It’s gripping, tense and is extremely well put together. I think there must have been pressure on her in deciding what parts to keep and what parts to edit, since the final output that this film projects of Earheart is of a very non-offensive nature. The kind which wouldn’t want to upset the succeeding generations of the lead protagonists.You become sure about this when you see the deleted scenes in the DVD extras. It throws some light on Amelia’s love life before she met Putnam. It also introduces us to a character mercilessly chopped out from the final cut - that of Putnam’s first wife. All her scenes were removed from the film.I must also point out that the DVD extras noted on the cover are a bit of lie. The disc inside doesn’t have a Making of Amelia, The Power of Amelia Earheart, Movietone News and Trailers. Now, that’s cheating, the last thing one needs after seeing a disappointing film.

23,84,84,84,84,Amelie,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/amelie-review/,,,,2.0,"With Valentine’s Day around the corner, here’s an enchanting tale set in the most romantic destination of all - Paris. A story of a girl with a lonely childhood who becomes a do-gooder and finds love along the way. Amelie is a treat for your senses - shot so beautifully, every frame is delicious in colour and shades, every sub-plot having the life of a charming, feel-good short-story in itself. Audrey Tautou is memorable in the title role that went on to bring her international acclaim. Nominated for 5 Oscars and winner of Best Foreign Language at BAFTA Awards. Winner of People’s Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival, 2001.","I heard about Amelie for the first time during the 2001 edition of the Academy Awards, when it was being hailed as the favourite to win for Best Foreign Language film. The trailers, rich in colour, had caught my attention much more than the winner in that category, No Man’s Land. Ashutosh Gowariker (who was lobbying for Lagaan) had described Amelie as a “very cute film”.Ten years later, when the DVD of the film officially released in India, I couldn’t wait to get my hands on it. It had been a long wait and the film lived up to my expectations. This charming comedy is about a young girl, Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) with a lonely childhood. She grows up and thanks to a miraculous coincidence of destiny, decides to become a do-gooder, helping people around her find happiness. In the process, she embarks on finding some happiness for herself, as she falls in love with a stranger who, just like her, gets joy out of life’s simple pleasures.The film is like watching an artist’s dynamic and alive canvas, for close to two hours. Few films have captured Paris so beautifully as this film has - every frame is the stuff picture postcards are made of, dripping with pastry shades and colours that have been brought to life by some meticulous digital retouching. The film is an achievement in cinematography with agile zoom-ins, top angle shots and soft, delicious lighting that makes every frame endearing. It also lends a certain swiftness and smooth flow to the film’s story, complimenting the stylishly crafted screenplay. Paris looks like a fairy-tale throughout the film and director Jean Pierre Jeunet plays it up by introducing scenes that re-inforce that feeling (the scene at a funfair, for example.) Tautou’s close-ups have a certain discipline about them, depicting her shy nature with regularity, yet exuding a certain charm, which the actor has perfected in this film. Amelie is also a lesson in drawing character outlines and sub-plots. The writers manage to make menial stuff look interesting, by giving each character distinct eccentric shades. So there’s a neighbour who sleeps all day, a bullying vegetable vendor down the street, a book-stall owner who cannot resist some gossip, a customer at a restaurant who pops bubble-wrap to pass time, an artist who has bones as brittle as glass. And there’s a young man, Nino (Mathieu Kassowitz) who collects one-minute photos which end up being discarded. The wild-goose-chase that brings Amelie and Nino together is a highlight of the film, as is a kiss shared by the two. It is one of my favourite first kisses on screen - gentle, innocent, sweet, cute, deserving, all rolled into one. The absence of a background score during those moments makes the kiss almost perfect. The soundtrack of the film lends the film a lot of its casual, whimsical feel. It’s a score that has over the years begun to be associated as very French, and full credit to musician Yann Tiersen for the same. Some tracks from the film have been my ringtones for a long time. And whenever my phone has rung and people have  remarked, “Isn’t that from Amelie?”, I’ve smiled and  realised what wonders Tiersen’s melodies have worked on audiences.The Indian edition of the DVD, released by Shemaroo is heavily censored, and therefore the U/A rating. Amelie’s childbirth scene, the shot where she guesses how many people in this world must be having an orgasm at that moment, and a lovemaking scene in the toilet of a restaurant, are all censored. Naturally, those scenes seem abrupt in the DVD. Further, the absence of any DVD extras is a major downer. I would have really loved to see the making of the film and the director’s commentary. Despite having watched a really good film, the DVD left me feeling incomplete.

24,85,85,85,85,Amen,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/amen-review/,,5/5.0,,3.5,Amen is a short film that has been withheld by the censor board because it uninhibitedly explains and shows homosexuality. It is more an awareness film than a story that certainly deserves a release. ,"Disclaimer: Amen is based on the true life story of Harish Iyer. Harish is a friend and an inspiration. Amen is currently stuck at the censor board which has refused the 'A' (Adult certificate) because of explicit sexual content. Also, this review is for adults only.Update: The DVD is now available here. Go get your copy. Amen is a beginner's lesson in homosexuality, Homosexuality 101 so to speak. And thus it also teaches us about our homophobia. Not so much the semantics of how it's done, but Amen unveils the various myths associated with homosexuality. Given our immaturity as a society on the subject, it is a much-needed lesson. Amen's focus is clearly on showing the human side to gay people. The frustration that it comes from is apparent. Gay people are misunderstood as different and thus 'heartless' and Amen tries to show you what the misunderstanding is all about. Andy and Harry meet through an online community and Andy hasn't come to terms with his sexuality. He represents us, as a society. From his attitude towards his own sexual orientation to the sexual abuse that Harry faced as a child. The latter, though only one of the elements in Amen, is a genuine concern for us as a society and specifically young parents. Actors, Karan Mehra and Jitin Gulati bring the insecurities and resignation faced by gay people with brilliant sensitivity. In times when homosexuals are used in Indian films mainly as comic relief, or rather to be ridiculed, Karan and Jitin's bravery is beyond applause. It's not only bold, what they portrayed, but it also takes pluck and a strong spine to take the risk, as far their careers are concerned too. The characters are simple and the relationship issues are normal, if you take out the homosexual angle. And that is the main point that Amen tries to make. It is simple, it is normal. There should be no necessity to emphasize it. The opening sequence of the film is extremely uncomfortable. In a culture where two flowers coming together symbolizes sexual attraction and at many a time intercourse itself; straightforward and to-the-point sexual intimacy between two men is naturally going to make one awkward. But, the uneasiness is in us. And it's high time we deal with it. Just for the dearth of films based on the subject, Amen is a must-watch. Sure, there are bits that come across as preachy because of the point that the film is trying to make. It also felt like a documentary, an awareness film made palatable by use of a human story wrapped around relatable characters. Amen is a quick watch at less than 25 minutes. And compared to the innumerable violent and sexually explicit 'item' numbers that make their entry into Bollywood Friday-after-Friday, Amen is a film that needs to see a release. One of cinema's job description is to educate, isn't it the duty of the censor board as the education ministry then to allow what needs to be publicly acceptable knowledge?

25,86,86,86,86,American Hustle,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/american-hustle-review/,,,,3.5,"The most exciting ensemble cast of the year delivers exactly what it promises in David O. Russell's hilariously manic tale of ambition and deceit in the America of yore, based on a true life scam. ","There are at least two terrific things one takes away from David O. Russell's latest. The first is that his terrific ensemble cast, good enough to make you want to watch a film that even starred any one of them, delivers knockout performances without exception. The second, more importantly, is that Russell is slowly beginning to develop a strong, envious filmography; combine this film with his last two - Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter (not to mention one of his much older films, 1999's Three Kings, which makes for a decent, engaging watch) - and he has emerged as a director to always watch out for, here on.He uses his own penchant for crackpot characters that he displayed in Silver Linings Playbook, and adds a dash of Scorsese to it; complete with those familiar voiceovers - except, Russell goes full throttle on the mental with it.If you've watched Scorsese's latest cult classic, this year's The Wolf of Wall Street, you'll be excused for feeling just a wee bit of dejá vu, before Russell's twisted, neurotic characters make you get over it quite soon. If  Wolf was about material excess and debauchery, Hustle is all inside the heads of the characters. Based on a true life story of a scam in the 70s, American Hustle revolves around an art scamster played by Christian Bale and his partner Sydney (Amy Adams), who are coerced into participating in a plan hatched by an FBI agent - Bradley Cooper - to bait dishonest Congressmen. Well, that's that. This is the kind of film where the plot matters much lesser than the situations and interactions between the characters. Often unrelated to the larger story, the characters keep getting into actual and metaphorical tangles, as they cope with the cards life deals them.Every crazy character has their own set of crazy desires, and the drama nearly always plays out at high octane hilarity no matter how serious the actual scene at hand is supposed to be in the lives of those in it. This is the crazy America of the '70s, and Russell gives us a quintessentially American film; the land of ultimate, unbridled ambition, and the wherewithall to chase it at all costs.With Bale, Adams, Cooper and the ultra-talented Jennifer Lawrence as Bale's psychotic, passive-aggressive wife, Russell combines the cast of his last two films, and ups the ante with their performances. Bale, in particular, is a marvel. For the casual cinegoer, Christian Bale will probably always be Batman. But if you've watched more of his other work, then it becomes clear that despite doing three Batman films, the character of Batman for him is but an aberration. He is a chameleon, willing to undergo whatever physical transformation it takes to become the character. His pot-belly and waning hair here add such tremendous texture to his overall presence.American Hustle is a long film. At well over two hours, the film meanders and takes its time to go where it wants to. Often, the detours in the screenplay seem like indulgences, even if the scenes stand out themselves. There are too many confrontations, and the film could have done with a better dramatic graph. The sub-plot regarding Christian Bale's and his wife's character - and the effect that his relationship with Adams has on it - seem like it was devoted too much attention.Then again, that could just be me. The film largely keeps you interested; and as I mentioned earlier, the interest extends to when and what David O. Russell has in store for us next.

Which by itself isn't a bad thing, but difficult to make an interesting story out of. ","Romcoms by default have a fresh feel about them. They are light and fluffy and are intended to make you smile at the exaggeration. In that way, Amit Sahni Ki List fits the bill perfectly. It also tries to be different in the sense that it's all about this guy who is all set in his life and seems completely focused on finding the perfect woman. His search is built up reasonably well, but doesn't hold interest after a point. A part of it might be because Amit Sahni doesn't quite know what he wants. But then again, who knows what they want? In that sense, it is realistic with Amit rushing towards the side that looks greener. My guess is, this would have been fine had the film been unbiased towards who Amit should pick. The film has clearly picked sides but wants us to believe that Amit is the decision-maker. And this is where the film looks like it has lost its advantage. It has Amit Sahni represent the lost urban youth when it comes to love. That generation which thinks it knows exactly what it wants when it comes to a life partner, but has no clue when push comes to shove, also known as, when they fall in love. The pity is that there is no way the film could've ended right. Whatever Amit Sahni did would've done, it would've been a dissatisfactory call. Fortunately, we have the performances in the right ballpark. Vir Das is aptly charming and confused. Vega Tamotia is her brand of cute and so is her character Mala. Anindita Nayar does the slick, businesswoman bit neatly. Kavi Shastri has the best lines of the lot and has a good comic timing to pull them off too.The film tries its hand at being modern all to be more annoying than trying to connect with the audience. It has Amit Sahni's mom speak in SMS-ese. So she actually talks in abbreviations. Then you have SMS/chat exchanges show up on screen in call bubbles. All very slick but this distracts from the story, rather than blend with the narrative. It all comes across as very overt. For all its modernity, Amit Sahni Ki List does keep the regular traps of relationship films. And it looks like a very deliberate attempt. So, while you do have the couple bond over the regular fun, filmy things, there is something very natural about the way they behave too. Interestingly, they keep sex out of the picture completely. The regular arguments related to friends and career are avoided too. Yet, you don't sense the chemistry except in a couple of scenes. A lot of it has to do with Amit Sahni breaking the fourth wall and talking to us, quite unnecessarily so. Other than that, the songs are not too intrusive. I'd like to talk specially about the opening song. The film is called Amit Sahni Ki List - that is a film which includes the male protagonist's name in its title. It starts with an all woman song that has lyrics that claim that the women are more than just their bodies. But visually, it is like any other item number fully focused on objectifying their sexuality. It is disturbing. This song looked nothing like the trailer, so it was disorienting. I almost wondered if I walked into the wrong screen. Only to find out that it indeed had nothing to do with the film, and unabashedly so. The first line of the film claims that they did it for the producers! I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Off late, I am in a similar conundrum with respect to my overall opinion of a film. I don't like how the film was narrated or how they got to the conclusion or what specifically the conclusion was too. At the same time, story-wise I can't quite tell what would've been a fairly reasonable change they could've made. Maybe even fluffy romcoms, while staying within the realm of exaggeration they are allowed, have started representing life all too well. Maybe that's what doesn't work about these films - they don't take me to a fairyland and neither do they stay real enough for me to identify with them.

A colorless and mundane thriller which would be of interest only to Dan Brown fans.,"I am not an admirer of Dan Brown, and though I have read the Da Vinci code, I did not bother to see the film, as I found the book to be very badly written. The fictional universe of Angels and Demons is set in a time post the events depicted in the Da Vinci code, as the initial dialogues make clear. This is not a caper film, it is not a heist film, and it is definitely not in the tradition of The Omen and The Exorcist. Both The Omen and The Exorcist had Christian themes, but dealt with eschatological and primordial fears of mankind, as portrayed through Biblical imagery. This made the films powerful and terrifying at the same time. Angels and Demons has a far more prosaic plot and is set in the modern world. Here the premise is that of a treasure hunt; a hunt where the hero has to figure out various clues to achieve the outcome. The movie that immediately comes to mind is Raiders of the Lost Ark, which was also based on a Biblical theme. But that movie had a hero with pizzazz, Indiana Jones with his trademark fedora and bull whip embodied the archetypical hero, who was masculine, dashing, and intelligent. Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon just does not make it. His role is too flat, all he does in the movie is to crinkle his eyes and spout Vatican history related dialogues. Maybe it is not Hank's fault at all, the character of Robert Langdon is very unidimensional. He exists only as a prop to keep the plot moving, and nothing else; we do not understand and relate to him as a human being, as there is a total absence of character development. That holds true for all the other characters too, the only exception being the character of Cardinal Strauss played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. But even there, it is the physiognomy and presence of Mueller-Stahl, which gives his character a definition. Ewan McGregor as the Camerlengo has the maximum screen time and is a key plot point, but is as common as they come. Stellan Skarsgard’s character could have been played by a mannequin and it would have made absolutely no difference at all. The screen play makes Robert Langdon rush around Rome and Vatican City, all huffing and panting, and make his way through various churches, crypts, and catacombs, accompanied by a pretty nuclear physicist (Ayelet Zurer as Vittoria Vetra), who has absolutely nothing to do, but look suitably impressed and worried by turns. A hand held camera is used to convey a sense of urgency, but it gets repetitive after some time. The clues are all references to Renaissance works of art and would appeal only to art historians (assuming they are factually true). There is no sense of mystery, no sense of awe, as the clues are uncovered. For a film of this premise to work, this would be mandatory; the viewer must be transported to a place and time far removed from everyday reality and would at the same time experience a heightened contrast with the everyday present. The director throws in a few scenes to highlight the struggle between religion and science, but does not tilt it either way. The climax has a final twist, but one accepts it as just another happening in the scheme of things. There is no catharsis, no upsurge of emotion, and definitely no feeling of redemption as we watch it. Ron Howard is a professional and here he has dished out a Hollywood processed fast food offering; one eats it and as long as one is eating it, one is conscious that something is going on, but the moment it is over, one cannot even remember a vestige of the taste, however hard one tries.

After all, you can say ""boy meets girl"" only in so many different ways. Despite that when you have fun; and you care for the boy and the girl; you know you are watching a brilliant film. And since the means are good, the time it takes to get to the yawn-inducing approach to the end and the end itself doesn't hurt that bad. A bit, yes.","Mr. Siddharth Anand and I need to have a word about lousy endings to films with decent starts and middles. That aside, I'm mighty pleased with the missing voiceover introductions. It also helps that there is no need for self-referencing with a producer who is not one Mr. Chopra. Worry not, I liked Anjaana Anjaani for the things that it is too. It is funny, it is crisp, it uses every-day, fun, and friendly quips to keep you laughing even though the story is not really moving on. I've always been allured to the topic of 'suicide'. Does it take more strength to end one's life or to face it? No, no, no there is no such deep philosophy being discussed in the film (except for one lame monologue attempted by Tanvi Azmi which the film could have so done without). In fact, the time devoted to the three acts is too staggered. It's like two hours into the two-and-a-half hour film there was a desperate rush for a conflict. The late arrival takes away from what could otherwise have been a wonderful and I daresay 'real-life' dilemma. A 150-minute film with only two main characters sounds excessive. This unjustifiable excess makes film seem slow and worse yet, banality of the characters' problems comes through. Suddenly, an issue that you could identify with comes across as self-obsession of the rich and the mindless. I'm not saying I want poverty porn, but fat fairy tale in party-land got tedious for a bit. Sure, Anjaana Anjaani talks about the last wish(es) and hints towards the meaning of life. It's all too superficial though. Because that concept is not the focus. It's just the thread holding the two characters together. These two characters get to know each other while we are getting to know them too. We are a part of their journey. They remind us of friends we have; those who get drunk and are more fun than ever; those who are hurting inside but are always making people around them laugh; those who we tolerate despite their self-obsessed sulking. Thankfully, there aren't too many side characters hovering around. Just imagine having to see pink-lipstick-hyperventilating friend more than the two minutes of his screen time. Sheesh. We already had Zayed Khan overstaying his welcome. Ranbir Kapoor, well, we are too accustomed to see him fall in love and realize it. He does it well without making it look like puppy love any more (despite his puppy eyes). So well, that I expect no less from him and give no extra credit when he meets those expectations. Tough luck, dude, bane of being a good romantic hero. O-kay enough beating around the bush! I cannot keep myself from raving about Priyanka Chopra any more. Wow! Has the lady eased into her role as an actor on this earth or has she? Her comic timing, lilt in dialogue delivery, pauses are just brilliant. Her smile has a screen presence of its own but she doesn't overuse it. When her eyes reflect the pain she's going through, you want to hurt the make-up person who glycerinated them. Of course, a lot of her dialogue delivery was possible only because of the dialogue. But, every once in a while it would go the cliché way, making the eye roll inevitable. Also the writing department seems to have taken a leave when the climax was being shot. Oops! I already complained about that. Well, it was that bad. It also hurt a bit that though the movie revolved around a woman, her life revolved around the men in her life. No career, no money worry, unabashedly dependent.  I guess I have to live with it being a story about a woman like that. Also, such a movie does annoying things to stick to mainstream formula while trying its bit to be different. Are we such snobs as an audience that we can't take our glam doll's hair out of place even when she is completely distraught? Do we have to snicker and make caricatures out of the queer? An urban tale about a generation that doesn't know its way around. You can identify with the problems and the way they are put forth. Even though it is difficult to react similarly or arrive at the same solutions.

Rajat Kapoor’s Ankhon Dekhi is a bittersweet little film filled with texture and life. ","It only makes sense for us to pause, once in a while, and ask ourselves the question, “Why do we believe what we’re told, even if we haven’t seen it with our own eyes?” As beings of a supposed higher intellect, with more than enough mental powers of analysis and reason, not to mention a far higher level of curiosity than any other living species, it would seem like humans would be far more individualistic creatures, not given to the level of unquestioning, blind following and hero worship that we’re so prone to, in reality. This behaviour of our species is perplexing, to the say the least.Also perplexing, but equally delightful, is Rajat Kapoor’s Ankhon Dekhi – an earnest film that straddles the whimsical and the realistic in equal measure, as it shows us the journey of a man who grapples with this very question. A film that is all about the characters, the setting, the texture of their lives, and the mad little moments that come together to complete their various inter-relationships.The film is set in old Delhi – the same Delhi of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra’s Delhi 6 – except you get a far more realistic sense of place here. If a character stops for a kachori or a samosa, you can almost smell the smoky surroundings and the aroma of fried delicacies; you can almost feel the cramped lanes and the overhanging winter.  The characters themselves are a mad bunch. There’s the protagonist – the elder in the family; a man who reacts to a mid-life crisis in the strangest of manners. But he does so with so much conviction that he builds a guru-like following - a strange paradoxical twist that undermines the very question he seeks the answers to. Then there’s his verbose wife who sparkles of sincerity, froths over with frustration over her husband’s antics, yet seems the only one who can handle him. And so many more.Ankhon Dekhi is as much about each of the characters and their relationships, as it is about the protagonist’s journey. It is here that the film walks a thin line – it almost borders on the surreal at times, while also showing the very real problems and misunderstandings that can crop up between two brothers, between a family and a prospective suitor for their daughter. Rajat Kapoor attempts to show us how, even if circumstances are never in our control, how we react to those circumstances almost always is.But it is also here that that the film tends to waver. The goings-on, at times, seem to be quite pointless, not taking the film either forward or back. Then again, one could argue that so much in real life happens which seems to have no point at all. They happen because they have to. For instance, an inexplicable cameo appearance by a fine actor as a tourist looking for Jama Masjid has no beginning or end to it. It just happens with no explanation, no need, and yet it isn’t something you can fault. Or perhaps you can. The pointlessness seems to be the point of it.Ankhon Dekhi manages to make you smile quite often. Charming, moving performances by Sanjay Mishra as the father (and older brother – one of the important relationships shown in the film), Seema Pahwa as his wife and Rajat Kapoor himself as the younger brother anchor the film, as do the little bit parts by the ensemble cast. Brijendra Kala, one of the best character actors we have, for example, does a fine job.Ankhon Dekhi, then, often seems like an easy film to watch, but is also a puzzle at times. A study in contradictions, a gentle look at people and relationships, a wonderful example of how a film can be rooted and still be fanciful. It makes you ponder over it, it makes you want to relive it, but it also doesn’t completely convince you of whether you liked the film or not. It raises questions, and answers them with more questions. That, I suppose, is the film’s biggest victory.

32,93,93,93,93,Annabelle,Watch when on TV/online,wogma review,/movie/contact-filmmakers-imdbpro-7-annabelle-review/,,,,3.4,"A spinoff (and chronologically, a prequel) of James Wan's The Conjuring, Annabelle, directed by John R. Leonetti, is a weak horror film. Apart from a couple of startling moments, the film follows an uninspiring graph that doesn't have even a fraction of the thrilling heft that one would expect when making a follow-up to a James Wan film.","There is a fundamental problem with Annabelle. The eponymous doll that stares down at you from the posters of the film, (which, if you remember, made a small appearance in James Wan's excellent The Conjuring, is creepy as hell. There seems to be no logical reason why a sane person would, of their own will, keep such an ugly thing in their home, particularly when there's a baby on the way. I'm not talking supernatural, here. I'm just talking plain aesthetics.Either way, once you move past that little hitch, you really want to be wowed by a film like Annabelle. It has all the staples that go into an engaging horror film - a beautiful young couple, an adorable baby, and that excruciatingly hideous doll. But, a handful of moments apart, the film is rather bland.The problem lies mostly in the mild, tempered manner in which the characters and their woes have been written. Despite her classical good looks, the lead actress (whose name, curiously, is also Annabelle,) - the primary subject of the haunting - has a flat, one-note and predictable character. Same goes for her husband, an annoyingly supportive fellow who never seems to take a step that's against his wife's wishes. Now I don't encourage disobeying one's wife, but some amount of conflict in their relationship would have done the film a world of good. It would have put something at stake apart from the obvious.Instead, they are a sincere, god-fearing and hard-working pair that no one would ever wish to harm. They're so perfect that even at the most depressing points in the film, you feel quite sure that nothing bad can happen to them. The haunting of Annabelle, the doll is also written in a slipshod, unconvincing manner.The scares themselves are also mostly unimaginative. They seem to follow a checklist of sorts, making them almost always predictable from a mile away. In fact, this is usually my biggest grouse with horror films - the moments that are meant to scare you are very rarely organic, derived from the plot and setting. They rely more on startling the audience, than on building a sense of foreboding and that tingling of the nerves.Another aspect where this film misses out is on the sense of time and place. Annabelle is set before the events of The Conjuring, which itself was set in the late 60s. However, unlike the latter, which was so consumed in its period that it drew you in, Annabelle seems to hardly ever feel authentic and true to its period. It hurts the film at a subtle level.What you're left with, then, are conflict and resolution - both of which are rather tame, never once causing thrill. Seasoned cinematographer John R. Leonetti, who has shot a number of James Wan's films, is the director of Annabelle. While he certainly has considerable experience lighting and shooting horror, his direction is at best functional, never once seizing on the openings for genuine horror that the script provides him.Though, to be fair, at least a few moments in the film are crafted well enough to cause the more weak-bladdered members of the audience to soil their pants. For the most, however, Annabelle is just horror-lite. The film would work better as a primer for those who've never had the liver for horror, than for a toughened horror film fanatic.

It is a touching, simple film that communicates the personal pains and feelings of an autistic child’s parents. A brilliant film stands out for a perfect blend of all the technicalities of cinema. If any one aspect is bolder than the rest, then we tend to refer to the film as well shot, or well edited or good story etc, etc. Apna Asmaan in totality is a film that is complete in itself. Communicating through cinema has never been so complete. That is why it is so unique, and has stood out. Most popular cinema takes it as a given that the audience is not a thinking population and comes to sit back and talk on the cell phone or eat popcorn, coffee etc. They often insult the viewers mind or stick to the theatrical performances of Shahrukh Khans.This film however, has transcended this problem. The director has shown maturity and full understanding of the viewers. At no point of the film does it tend to go off into ridiculous overacting. In fact, given the storyline and lines, Irfan and Shobhana have done a wonderful job. Good direction and the right choice of actors have made the film so perfect. The script and story are married with all fine points taken care of. However what struck me in due course of the film was the inability of the director to break from the stereotypical image of the woman as a mother and wife. New age cinema in India should attempt to break such stereotypes; otherwise the same would circulate in the subconscious minds of the viewers. It is known and well researched that films have a strong influence on the society at large. In such a case only sensitive filmmakers can come forward to break certain myths where women are concerned. There seems to be a subtle hint about the modern intelligent woman and her aspirations for her family and herself in this movie. There is a negative image that evolves, that does not promote women to step beyond home and family.Otherwise Apna Asmaan is a brilliant film worth watching and remembering. Kaushik Roy, though an ex-adman and first-time movie director, has brought out a theme so real and close to life without adding too much of unnecessary excesses of regular Hindi commercial cinema.

The beauty is the director has a minimal role to play. It only takes a one-word instruction to the loud actors - ""louder!!"". And then have the louder compete for the loudest. Hire an amateur cameraman who wants to try out all the lenses and angles in the book. Since all the other work is taken care of so efficiently, the director can write the dialogues himself. After all, for every 100 inane lines written there is sure to be a-line-and-a-half that will make the average person laugh. That is much more than what a comedy of this caliber aims at! By the way, there is only a slight connection between the title of the movie and what most of the characters feel about money.Koena Mitra, Celina Jaitley and Riya Sen are like toy rattles; they amuse the target audience, but the noise they create is intolerable for the rest. The show of skin is unbeatably gratuitous. What a wonderful waste of talents like Riteish Deshmukh, Shreyas Talpade, and Anupam Kher! Though Riteish’s comic timing is great, his whole act looks like a repeat performance of the dozen odd comic roles he has done. His make-up as a girl is done really well. Shreyas Talpade has done the best he could with a character that had very few lines. Anupam Kher unnecessarily does yet another unnecessarily tasteless character. Suniel Shetty does justice to his role and has especially superb timing in a couple scenes.  Too little, too late. All these half-decent performances put together cannot save the movie from the random story and shoddy screenplay. Sexual innuendos galore can amuse only teenagers. There is the typical slapstick fare - loads of make-up and wigs, people slapping each other in circles, the few funny lines losing their charm by repetitiveness, people playing catch with diamonds that fly in air. Add to this a dash of melodrama - ""“xxxxx needs yyy lakhs of Rupees for an operation, or they are going to die in z hours"". The perfect recipe for a nagging headache. The picturisation of all songs (except the title song) would have done better in an album made for M TV. Feet tap with the music of the title song and ‘Dil mein bajaa guitar’ and they are half-hummable. What nags me is – was it worth my reader’s time to even read this review?
