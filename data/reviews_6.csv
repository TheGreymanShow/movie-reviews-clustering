0,1297,1297,1297,1297,Via Darjeeling,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma reviewNotepadPreview16 Critic Reviews 1.3/5.0 1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/via-darjeeling-review/,1.3/5.0,3/5.0,,2.733333333,The broad concept is truly intriguing but the basic story is like a balloon losing air...phuuussss,"I couldn't stop laughing for about a minute after the credits started rolling. And had a smile on my face for the next few minutes. Nope! Even the most easily amused can't term this one a comedy. I am just kicked by how the audience is taken for a ride. It's not a super-fun ride because by no means is it a great cinematic experience or an entertainer. It's just a smart concept that didn't manage to keep me hooked. In the interest of sounding a little less abstract and yet be truthful to the theme of this blog, I'm going to use an analogy. Say, you are a teacher who's going to introduce a new topic to the class today. To make the lesson more interesting you choose to play a game. Now the idea of playing a game is really neat, but, BUT if you choose a boring game, you have lost your class. Your creativity is admirable, but the class is not engaged. So, the idea of playing a game here is the broad concept of Via Darjeeling and I'm going to call the choice of game, the basic story. The conversation between a bunch of people discussing an event can only be as interesting as the event. As a character points out, this discussion could have been a classic study of human nature. But it's not, because the basic premise is lame. The story is somewhat saved by the ever-reliable Kay Kay Menon. The subtle changes in his character as he moves from one part of the movie to the next, are absolutely attributable to his performance. You can actually see some of it in Parvin Dabas' act too. Sonali Kulkarni's hammed up performance can also be passed off under the guise of her character's eccentricity and ambiguity. But, the entire set-up of friends talking, having fun, quibbling with each other, came off as extremely superficial. If one relationship oozed with extreme familiarity at one point, in the next, the same characters would be saying things to each other that made them seem like strangers. There's only fleeting interplay amongst the characters.So, while the individual characters were detailed, the relationships were very broadly sketched. And we are talking about the likes of Vinay Pathak, Rajat Kapoor, Sandhya Mridul, Prroshant Narayanan here. I have liked their work in one movie or the other, so am not willing to blame them completely for lack of the proverbial chemistry. Compound that with the overall drawling tone of the movie and you can't be blamed for getting a wee bit fidgety. And if that wasn't enough, the songs are absolutely misplaced, and don't go with the ambiance created by the movie. Yet, the director cannot be written off, because he tried. Tried something not ventured into easily by Hindi cinema - a story without a closure. There's after all no conflict that needs resolution. And trying out gets brownie points around here. Along the way, he also commented on the basic nature of humans to indulge themselves in something that doesn't concern them whatsoever. And though it doesn't hook the audience, it surely teases them right through to the end.

1,1298,1298,1298,1298,Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/vicky-cristina-barcelona-review/,,,,2.733333333,"In an interview with Woody Allen about the film, the interviewer asks him if, after trying to explore relationships in most of his films, he has found an answer. Allen replies, “I haven’t found any answers that you would want to hear”. The answer is more apt to the film than his personal life, where it doesn’t matter what you draw out of your experience of meeting a certain individual or indulging in an event/situation. What matters is how you chose to go about the experience and whether you could milk the most out of it before jumping to an “informed conclusion”. As a film, Vicky Cristina Barcelona does exactly that. ","Has it ever happened that you overhear a strange conversation, and somehow even though it defies every sense of logic, the words make absolute sense to you? For example, “We are meant for each other and not meant for each other. It’s a contradiction”. I know you understand that line – and Woody Allen knows it too. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is one such film that helps us understand that we are not alone in our chasms of strange thought. As the Woody Allen norm goes, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a character heavy-film. It stands apart from his regular treatment of films, however, because the mood and tone is not portrayed with neurotic dialogues but with scenic surroundings that lend its flavour to the spirit of the film. In this film, Allen has used Barcelona and the Spanish country-side as an additional character, lending its own perspective. The film begins with two friends, Vicky and Cristina, who are on a holiday in Barcelona. They are complete opposites – while Vicky (Rebecca Hall) is disciplined and organized, Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) is more the free-spirit. On a whim, they decide to take upon Juan Antonio’s (Javier Bardem, who plays a local painter) offer of joining him on a weekend of self-indulgence (wine, conversation and hours of going-with-the-flow). Through their journey and interactions, we see  their extravagances and their restraints, their discoveries and their ignorance. All come into being through a concoction of mood-setting (lighting and landscape cinematography), performances that depend more on gaze and facial expression than dialogue and that beautiful flamenco background music that gives a sense of freedom. A free-spirit that Allen as the director has allowed the characters to experience through the film.The film picks pace with the entry of Juan Antonio’s ex-wife Maria Elena (Penélope Cruz). Maria Elena as a character is a bit of a contradiction – she’s easily the most neurotic of the lot, and yet her silence conveys much more than her words. There is a scene in the film, taken from a top angle, which shows her furiously working on a canvas, wearing a torn piece of cloth to cover her. She moves from one stroke to another with absolute silent passion. To me, that scene describes her character best, and makes it apparent that by virtue of mere presence, she’s the star of the film.The film’s high point is in its interactions; be it a singular character’s interactions with the city and its visuals, their interactions with art or photography, or their interactions with one another. Each one lends a different perspective to you as a viewer and Allen knows exactly when to include words/dialogue to seal the scene – like a perfect package that leaves an ever-lasting imprint in your head. The DVD of Vicky Cristina Barcelona doesn’t have any extras, but I can tell you that you don’t need any. Calling it a sensual film that explores the various possibilities of the visual medium would be an understatement. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is plays out on itself – it’s a film that has its own education, where the characters indulge, discover, learn and portray. Surely you’d want to be a part of such an education.

2,1299,1299,1299,1299,Vicky Donor,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma reviewPreview40 Critic Reviews 4.8/5.0 14 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/vicky-donor-review/,4.8/5.0,5/5.0,,4.566666667,"Vicky Donor has a story which weaves in and out of a subject that is taboo, that too in an enjoyable and entertaining manner. Quick, witty lines are delivered with comfort and awesome performances. Even if you don't end up watching it on screen, do make sure you catch it on TV/DVD. ","If we are lucky enough to have a potential Hrishikesh Mukherjee amongst us, it would have to be Shoojit Sircar. Vicky Donor made me laugh, brought a tear to my eye, made me think, and it made me care about its characters - all in a setting we could accept as real-life. And it's not like the film doesn't have a good share of quirky characters (We have a whisky drinking granny, for goodness' sake!) but their quirks are made to look like they could easily belong to a neighbor's family, if not your own. For a subject as taboo and giggle-inducing as 'sperm donation', Vicky Donor does an awesome job of making it so regular even though the terms thrown at you are on-the-face. Each time Anu Kapoor says 'sperm' with a hand-gesture it makes you laugh out loud, right till the end. That's how good his comic timing is - that a signature phrase and symbol assigned to a character makes you laugh despite the repetition. Also, that's how good the writing is - because the time passed between two repetitions is just right and the things that come between them is either hilarious or entertaining, if not both. Yes, there is some non-hilarious entertainment. The drama and the romance are both engaging. After a really long time, I didn't have any problem believing a couple when they said they loved each other. Otherwise, either it is said too early, or one is blind to the other's love, or it is too mushy, or the lines are ridiculously shallow. Vicky Donor gets the romance 'Goldilocks' perfect.Same goes for the drama. This coming from a member of the audience who thinks she's has had just about enough of loud Punjabi characters and dialogue thrown at her. Beeji (Kamlesh Gill), Dolly (Dolly Ahluwalia) and the daughter-in-law-mother-in-law chemistry between them isn't something we are going to forget in a hurry and yet will want to revisit them every once in a while. I like Ayushman Khurana - even beyond his dimples. He has an easy-going screen presence that any actor should be proud of. His easy-go-lucky Punjabi munda mannerism is so casual that it is difficult to imagine him as any other character. I guess we'll have to wait for his next for that. Yami Gautam has a sweet charm that makes you reach out to the sadness within her when she's smiling, comfort her when she's obviously sad and identify with her PMS-ing shrill yelling when she's angry. Each character has depth and warmth - even the pushy Dr. Chaddha (Anu Kapoor) and his alter ego in the form of his assistant. Ashima's (Yami Gautam) dad and aunt add their own flavor to the mix - especially the scenes written between father and daughter. The extent to a dad can go to convince his daughter of anything - from choice of husband to how she's being silly in being upset with her husband - might seem outlandish, but we've all seen or heard of similar stuff in real-life.The screenplay is intriguing too. It is rather obviously episodic, it has five clear parts. The first which is covered in the promos where Dr. Chaddha is trying to convince Vicky to donate his sperm. Then you have Vicky wooing Ashima followed by an amazingly witty coverage of inter-caste marriage - a subject covered to death by Hindi cinema. The second half sombers up to cover more serious issues and the entire do has a clean albeit slightly mushy wrap-up. And in the midst of all this, you have a social message that never becomes preachy and will thus be effective, when a family faces an issue like this. After walking out of the theater, the superficial thoughts are that of having had fun for the last two hours, of having watched a good film. But half an hour later, when you have processed the film as a whole, I realized I liked it even more than I thought. And it is primarily because of this - Vicky Donor has so many elements that I thought I've had enough of and would've very grudgingly given benefit of doubt to any filmmaker or writer to cover even one of them with any freshness. But boy-meets-girl, Punjabi madness, repetitive dialogue/phrases, caste-based family issues, post-marital woes and recovery from them - Vicky Donor covers them all with a smile on its face and mine. It could be because it has a novel concept to tie this all in. Who would've thought that could happen?wogma and Bollywood and Fashion present the Vicky Donor contest. Tell us how you'd react if you are told that your friend is a Vicky donor and win filmy t-shirts!

The ball is made to bounce like a yo-yo on an extremely flat pitch. But, the good news is Hurman has begun to act!","I love watching cricket. I love our batsmen. I love the veterans as much as the new blood. I love our spinners, and I love our pace bowlers. I love our fielding when we do it and abuse the misfielding more often than not. And yet I cannot make myself watch the rerun of a match. Even if we have won. Even if my favorite batsman has scored a century. Even if a bowler has broken a world record. Well, what can I say, I am that kind of a cricket-fan. Imagine my plight when I watch an entire movie match, where I know not only the result (duh! The name of the movie is 'Victory!!), but also know it ball-by-ball. Yes, it is that predictable!!Sure, the scriptwriting textbook says have a set-up, a conflict, and a resolution. But these guys seem to have taken it a tad too seriously. Each act is build up to a limit where even a novice in movie-watching can forecast the next step and the two after that. The same goes for the lame lines given to one and all. I agree we are a cricket-crazy country. But repeating - once every 5 minutes - how the entire nation, ONE BILLION of us are looking up at/down upon a cricketer or are excited about/disappointed with an outcome becomes just too much to handle.Considering the overall issues with the writing department, the actors have done one helluva job! Hurman Baweja has certainly come a long, long way from Love Story 2050. He can actually cry convincingly. Very few male leads manage to not look like comedians when they do that. Amrita Rao is comfortable in her usual homely, warm character. Though here she occasionally bursts into the inner voice of different characters and brings them to their senses. But, I really want to see her do something different. Wouldn't she want that too? Anupam Kher, of course, makes the most of lines that have we've heard over and over again in the past few decades. The pride of a father, the stoop in his shoulder, the agony, the anger, the frustration can only be credited to his years of experience.Its not like predictability is a sin. O-kay it is. But not an unforgivable one. But there have been movies which are beautiful despite committing that one. This one is not. Maybe, just maybe, it might have worked if it was an hour shorter. Or maybe not.

4,1301,1301,1301,1301,Videsh,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma reviewNotepad26 Critic Reviews 1.9/5.0,/movie/videsh-review/,1.9/5.0,,,3.6,Preity's brilliant act & Deepa's execution play with gray cells. An out-of-the-box approach to domestic violence and superstition in the form of symbolism is thrown in too.,"Domestic violence and women’s empowerment would be the superficial issues that Videsh touches upon. Though these are by no means trivial, there are several deeper matters the film also tries to talk about. There's reference to the fact that strength of human willpower is generally under-rated. But one's strength doesn't necessarily have to be just willpower or intelligence or courage; it can be a subtler and a more abstract human capability. True - physical, verbal and thus mental abuse by different members of the family do make the marriage shown here incomparable to an average marriage. But the incompatibility between expectations and realities of a marriage are true of any marriage.  Preity Zinta gives the character, Chand, her vulnerability and her strength, her fear and her defiance. I can watch Videsh a few more times just to appreciate the nuances of her deglamorized performance. Vansh Bhardwaj plays her husband Rocky and does an equally laudable show. Given these acts and how well-thought the film is, it's difficult to imagine that the wooden expressions worn by the rest of the cast are unintentional. The glaring non-performances must have a reason I haven't been able to figure out. If nothing else, the indifferent faces effectively add to Chand's loneliness. This feeling of being alone while in company is magnified by the use of silence and of poetic prose in Chand's dialogues. Her disintegration due to her circumstances are a product of Rocky's aversion to talking - which means a wise non-usage of words to build his character. His silence frustrates us as an audience and sort-of makes us feel his frustration though we are not aware of the specifics. Then you have references to the Almighty and His influence on our lives is something that irks me often because of the kitschy way it is done in Hindi films. And in general, unless the plot's underlying assumption is the supernatural phenomenon, it works against the film. But, here in its quirky way, Videsh uses these things to represent the moral support and the liberation Chand feels. It also added to the heavy cynicism apparent in the title of the film Videsh - Heaven on Earth. A foreign land where Indians will do anything to go, but will end up creating anything but heaven there. And yet I feel something other than magical intervention would have worked much better as a symbol. The eerie close-ups, the slightly annoying handheld camera work, the unsettling silence due to the lack of background music, all add to the claustrophobic atmosphere Chand must experience in the ""free"" Western world. None of the outwardly issues touched upon have anything new about them - an abusive family, sarcasm at Indians' attempt to create India outside India, human crassness, strength of women, etc. But the philosophical bent given to the movie makes it far more superior to any other movie in this genre.

5,1302,1302,1302,1302,Vinnaithandi Varuvaya,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/vinnaithandi-varuvaya-review/,,,,3.6,"You might not understand a love-crossed, obsessive love – a surreal, ambitious love – a lifelong, desperate love – a love that transcends logic and comprehension but Gautam Menon's Vinnaithandi Varuvaya shows you all of that and makes you fall in love with it. ","Before anything, Gautam Menon’s Vinnaithandi Varuvaya (Will You Cross the Skies for Me) makes you understand what falling in love at first sight is all about. It might not convert you, but you’ll get it. The cult film, also known as VTV, and A. R. Rahman’s first project after the Oscar hype, is a beautiful, uncomplicated love story between people from different religions. You might find the plot a little too simple, you might not agree with the outcome – but the beauty of VTV lies in its ability to suck you in and make you understand the plight of the characters. Karthik (Silambarasan) and Jessie (Trisha Krishnan) live in different floors of a two-storied house in Chennai. Jessie is a tradition Christian girl, who wouldn’t dream of being even slightly rebellious. Karthik is a mediocre guy, who has ambitious plans of becoming a filmmaker. Gautam Menon doesn’t take much time in establishing the blazing chemistry between the two; being opposites yet having a strong pull towards one another. Ofcouse, there’s a conflict. She belongs to a strict Christian household, and she’s absolutely sure they have no future. And predictably so – Karthik doesn’t sit back. He pursues her, and he makes her fall in love with him. Typical filmy material right? Wrong. Menon spins his own visual spool to explain the love to us – mostly through Kathik’s thoughts manifested in dance sequences and surreal love-struck conversations with himself.  Thought bubbles keep running through your mind. Why can’t they just get together or why is Karthik so persistent about Jessie? We see Jessie through his eyes – she becomes the audience’s muse as well, and so when he continuously asks himself, “Of all the girls, why did I have to fall in love with Jessie” – there are no answers provided but you know why. Rahman’s music has a contemporary sound in the film – with echoes, choruses and thin voices - the songs become like melodic thoughts, be it the infatuated 'Hosanna', or the deeply lyrical 'Mannipaya'. The songs become a space for each character to sing out their stream of consciousness. The credit for this goes to Menon, for being able to use Rahman’s music and Thamarai (lyricist) words to capture the character’s contemplation and make it into a visual narrative of soulful melodies. The DVD of Vinnaithandi Varuvaya has no special features as such – but a good set of comprehensive subtitles and thankfully no loss in quality, because the film should be enjoyed for the visual treat that makes us fall, rise and celebrate the love being portrayed in the film.The best part about VTV however, is not the portrayal of love but in its ability to make you observe a positive angle through the struggle of love. VTV is as much a story of the frustrations and rejections  - but you empathize and relate with the characters without that dash of misogyny that most story-tellers might tend to use. That’s where Menon’s vision needs to be applauded, to be able to present a well-rounded story and make it strikingly about the love, the visual memories, and the characters and less about the struggle. The frustration is treated as a skipping stone in the trajectory of love. Eventually, as they toil to cross seas or skies for their love – they manage to draw a pretty darn good picture of it.

The film itself is a very average action flick attracting attention only because of Kamal Haasan. All Vishwaroop wants to say is, ""My name is Khan, and I'm not a terrorist."" His character that is. ","Two disclaimers - I saw the Hindi version. I have never been a Kamal Haasan fan.It has been ages since I've seen a Kamal Haasan film. The only reason I chose to watch the film was the ban - my way of showing support. I had decided to watch the film even if the Hindi version wasn't playing in a theater close to me. Even if I didn't understand a word. Fortunately, there was a Hindi version I could catch. Only for me to find out how much sillier the ban is than I originally thought it was. The only group of people it speaks against is the Taliban/Jihadis/Mujahiddins. So, did I get this right? Making this group of people out as villains hurts sentiments? Whose? Vishwaroop is a very average action flick at best and shouldn't be considered any more than that. I have never enjoyed Kamal Haasan's histrionics. He has always been a little over-the-top, caricaturish for my taste. The only thing I liked about Vishwaroop is Kamal Haasan's act, despite his effeminate act to induce laughter. Later in the film, he does make you believe about his reservations to the behavior of the people around him. Unfortunately, the people around him are annoying caricatures that are annoying, especially Omar, the one enacted  by Rahul Bose and oh yes, Nirupama, Vishwanath's wife played by Pooja Kumar. It didn't even look like it would be any better if here dubbing was better than that you see in English movies on TV. Only Jaideep Ahlawat seemed to be taking his role seriously. It doesn't help that the film is forced into becoming a comedy because of some lame behavior by the members of the Taliban. The action except for the first sequence - which is pretty cool, especially because of the repetition - is pretty ordinary. The rest of the action tries to horrify based on gore, which doesn't work at all. There was some potential of an engaging story when it delves into the lifestyle of the Jihadis' families. But soon you feel cheated because it is done only with the purpose getting you emotionally involved temporarily. Whatever interest is created fizzles out as the second half turns into the regular terrorism-based action flick. Let alone novel, it is pretty shoddily handled. Almost everything about Vishwaroop seems superficial. The dots aren't connected well. And yes,  you have been promised a Vishwaroop II.And yet, I shall rephrase a Voltaire quote that is often repeated these days I might not like what you have to say and how you say it, but I shall support your right to say it.

7,1304,1304,1304,1304,Vitti Dandu,Watch when on TV/online,wogma reviewNotepad,/movie/vitti-dandu-review/,,,,3.9,An uninspiring portrayal of patriotism.,"What is that one thing all historic,Indian patriotic films have in common? Oh yes, you guessed it right. Freedom fighters holding firelights in their hands and belting some heavily-worded, inspiring songs. I always wonder why the British captured freedom fighters while they were in hiding and never while they were singing openly. But that is how things are portrayed in our films. Being a patriotic tale, I was expecting all this mindless drama in Vitti Dandu. The film didn’t surprise me, barring its basic storyline.Revolved around vitti dandu – a rural game, the film is a fictional incident that took place just six days before the nation got independence. But at its core lies a heartwarming relationship between a grandfather (Dilip Prabhavalkar) and his grandson, who is now narrating that story to his own grandson. As he takes a stroll down memory lane, the tone of his voiceover changes abruptly. His narrative shows you other characters recounting their own memories; as if being a firsthand witness to every happening. This whole affair makes you wonder if the character is genuinely reciting the tale or director Ganesh Kadam is forcibly showing it.Vitti Dandu is an absolutely refreshing story on paper. But it turns out to be an exaggerated one on screen. A conventionally-written screenplay and over-the-top direction fail to match the sincerity of the story. Kadam rather tries to depict it in the same fashion as many other films of its genre, eventually affecting performances of some brilliant actors. Except a few sequences, Prabhavalkar performs at his usual best. Rest of the cast is passable. They seem to be driven by their characters, but end up doing unnatural theatrics.The film’s cinematography sorely misses the point. A simple treatment could’ve helped set the tone of 1947. Production design, too, fails to distinctively create that era. Editing doesn’t help the film either, making an already lackluster narrative even more vulnerable. Contemporary sounds effects and lip-syncing songs are totally out-of-place. Instead of intensifying your experience, they just add to the boredom.Indian films are no match to Hollywood in visual effects (doesn’t mean we’re superior in other departments). They are, in fact, wonderful examples of disastrous VFX. This is despite the fact that major Hollywood productions are outsourced to Indian VFX studios. Considering its budget; I don’t want to delve into Vitti Dandu’s visual effects quality, but the choice of it. The director’s preference to obviously fake appearances for the jeep-driving sequence is definitely startling.The climax sequence is one of my favorite terrible moments in the film. It somehow reminds me of those mindless, south Indian action potboilers. I literally couldn’t stop myself from laughing.

Fans of Sooraj Barjatya - if that species is not extinct yet - might enjoy a few moments of his typical style. The rest of us didn't care in the first place.The lead pair whispers as if the listener has the most delicate eardrums and the heroine heaves, with her head at a 45 degree angle, as if she is soon going to need asthma medication. It is acceptable if they did that for the first few times - throughout the movie though? All actors, in lead and supporting roles, try to make the best of what lines are given to them. The only actor that stands out is Seema Biswas, she suits the different character she is given. You have the predictable dialogues that spoon-feed the audience with details of  the most obvious, and leave out technical details lest they distract you from the story (if it can be called that). The predictable plot has the ‘world’s best’ human beings (especially the over-virtuous, obedient hero and the nauseatingly shy heroine) – except one. Then there is the predictable screenplay, where the only place a couple can meet is temples and the only clandestine rendezvous is on a rooftop. And surely, there is the predictable exhibition of expensive saris, salwar suits, and jewelry. Kudos to consistency!!! But, hey, the music is unpredictable – it is outright BAD! The good thing about earlier Sooraj Barjatya movies was at least they had songs you could appreciate when you saw them and were at least hummable. Songs of Vivah just make you wish the screeching stopped. Wake up, Mr. Barjatya, it is no more the 80’s. We are getting used to much better cinema and you have much better equipment to provide us with it. So, do not take us for granted and serve us sub-standard products!

It’s the background music – the piano interspersed with a part cheerful, part morose violin set. This immediately changes to a peppy pop song when the couple is all romantic and in love. If you learn to ignore this, and romance films are your thing – then The Vow will give you exactly that. However steer clear of the film if you’re looking for a rom-com; The Vow isn’t funny and you’d be better off watching 50 first dates instead. ","Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams look pretty darn good together. He’s handsome and manly, she’s petite and cute. You’ve won your battle by casting right in a romantic film – where the aim is for the audience to feel the love. It makes the job easier when the lead actors make a good looking pair. The Vow then is a love story between two fairly young individuals who find themselves in a bit of a spot. Everything seems romantically blissful for the newlyweds, Leo and Paige. They seem merrily in love, and their little parade of glee gets cut short when Paige loses her memory in a car accident. She doesn’t remember anything that happened in the last 5 years.On her part, McAdams does the whole confused bit pretty convincingly. Tatum is madly in love with his wife and through regular flashbacks we see the wonderfully romantic things he does for her – and you want to yank her out of her memory loss. But here’s the movie’s biggest problem: nothing is strong enough. The love becomes corny every now and then, no emotion (be it the horror of a memory loss, the frustration of a husband sharing an apartment with his stranger wife and so on) is established strong enough. Halfway through any portrayal, you already want to move onto to the main question the film poses: will she regain her memory?The Vow is based on a real-life incident involving Kim and Krickitt Carpenter, but it doesn’t really grip enough. The first few minutes of the film looks wonderfully bohemian, when we see Leo and Paige’s life. Her art studio with abstract clay cut outs, their apartment filled with color coordinated furniture in different shapes. But really, if that’s the one thing I remember warming my heart, the real hero of this film is production designer Kalina Ivanov.Unlike similarly plotted film, 50 First Dates, this film doesn’t have a comedy streak to fall back on. Or a goofy Adam Sandler. It could have been a fairly gripping film, with an interesting plot, if it steered clear of the regular cliché: love conquers all. Treated differently, perhaps the film could have focused on how Leo strives to make her fall back in love with him. On the contrary, The Vow leaves much to chance for the lead pair to realize their feelings for one another. Sure, it’s a well-behaved clean average film. If you’re in the mood for a cheesy weekend flick, The Vow delivers promptly. It could have been a crisp film; free from melodrama had the dialogues been given more attention, but with a good looking lead pair and a regular dose of love, this is your run-off-the-mill romance movie. If you’re into it, it gives you exactly what you want.

A sweet DVD/TV watch when its out.,"As morbid as it sounds, I have instructions on what's to be done if I meet with an accident if I were to go into a coma. Exactly, for the reasons that Waiting ponders over – there is no right or wrong when you are at a point to choose between keeping hope alive and letting go. Waiting takes on both sides without making it heavy-handed or too emotional either. That does create a distance between the audience and the characters but it works for the film. Anything else would have run into the danger of going into cliché territory. For example, you don't know much about Tara (Kalki Koechlin) or Shiv's (Naseeruddin Shah) relationships with their spouses. You are given glimpses here and there but not enough to make you feel like you knew it. It is more like a given. This causes the distance but if they were to pick the standard montage of  sweet 'moments', it would take Waiting into 'typical' category. Else, they would have to spend a lot of time in exposition. I will take a little disconnect till they figure out a newer way of telling us how good it was for the two couples. They are all regular people who have expected reactions to unexpected situations. No one gets extra character development or such. Interestingly though, a good and important introduction time is used for Tara's feminist side. We don't see that put to use anywhere? Why was it there then? To show us she speaks her mind? Well, we got that and Shiv elaborates on it too.  Unfortunately, it comes across as a gimmick to shock. Beyond that, in it's own sweet-yet-dull sort of a way, Waiting is not out there to create any great impact. There is no 
“coming-of-age”, there is no big reveal, no attempt at drama. That is why it stands out. A film about death and no drama! In its larger scheme the film might be about death and dilemmas around it. But, it is also a subtler comment on other life philosophies – every person has to fight their own fight; loners who hate people need company too; fate isn't fair. A dash about our distrust of the medical system is thrown in too. And then you have the more spelled out ones which I wish had taken a subtler route - like the stages of grief which read out like its Wikipedia page. No, Naseeruddin Shah as reader doesn't help. Both lead actors are wonderful though, their chemistry feels very real. They are one of the main reasons, the film took me out of 'review' mode and made me forget I was watching a film. That and the soft tone, the smooth texture of the film. Unfortunately, some of the other elements reminded me back into the film world. like Tara's husband's colleague, Girish seemed like a caricature or Tara and Shiv's decisions  didn't seem to flow with the pace of the film. These are little things that take away from Waiting. They make a film that I loved watching while I was watching it not keeping with me for too long after.

But even the opposites had something similar that keep them together, for each other, and maybe even for ever. Similarities or differences - celebrate whatever it is that is the cause of your love. A chick flick that's not only for chicks. ","The whiff of the Arabian Sea. You smell it. The first few drops of rain on your sweating forehead. You sense them. The love that only a Mumbaikar can express for his city. You feel it. I'm getting all romantic on you. You dread it. But what do I do when I see two people just be so comfortable on screen - as characters and as actors. Not necessarily romantically in the ""more than friends"" sort-of a way. But romantically as two individuals who react and interact. So, you got that? The number of times ""romantic"" and its derivatives have been repeated so far should indicate that you, the young lads, should already be planning that dinner date after the perfect date movie. And chicks, go watch this flick. The older generation on the other hand could empathize with the parents in the film. Sid is a normal, college-going kid - neither the superstar of his college, nor the super-buffoon. Neither the teenage heartthrob nor the class dunce. He's carefree and proud of it. Aisha is serious and knows what she wants. Her practicality is not an exaggeration, nor is it understated - a regular, motivated girl. Their contrasts - evident. Their similarities - to be deciphered. The first sequence in the film tells you this film is going take its own time to develop and unfold. And by the last sequence you know there isn't much unfolding to be done (except t-shirts and kurtis). The story is half-a-line and yet I'm going to be feel hurt on behalf of the makers if the audience complained, ""there was no story!"" At times when the movie goes deeper, it doesn't need too many words to describe the story. And the more time I spent with Sid (Ranbir Kapoor) and Aisha (Konkona Sen Sharma), the more I wanted to know them. It felt better to see screen time being spent on the niceties of their relationship. It was good to see them grow closer to and fonder of each other. Aaawww…that's what friendships should be like. And then I was deprived of more. And I was hurt when one was oblivious to the other's emotions just to satisfy the hunger for drama. Whether it’s the maker's hunger or the audience's - I do not know. But annoyed I was, to see the twosome that got me into their drawing room, throw me out by their out-of-character, ignorant behavior. Those two, who were candid, lucid and were supposed to be best of friends until a few minutes ago. Then there were the couple of side characters who were there just to throw in a punch. Anything to do with Karan Johar has to have some angle of parental love and associated dramatic moments. Whether or not they belong. And they do not belong here. Especially when you realize one of them has been caricatured just for that one punch line. The lines which were fine until then and later too. Smartly used by thinking and sensitive characters. And suddenly it's spoilt by one on-the-face line. While these individual characters didn't work, most of the interconnected relationships were well-developed with just a scene or two. But whatever bit the dialogue-writer lacked, was made up in the way the two protagonists were created. Of course, kudos to the two actors, one maturing, and one who looks like she was born with fully-developed acting skills. The maturing Ranbir Kapoor will, I guess, be the industry's first candidate for the puppy-look, innocent boy. And yet not boy-next door. I enjoyed bits of their performances more because of how up-close I saw their expressions. Similarly there is this whole list of things that add value due to their absence. And top on my list is the conscious decision of not having that pause, that moment of awkwardness between a boy and a girl because of that hug, that touch. Its handled delicately and with finesse. We were just getting used to a superficial attitude of making a film about the woman protagonist, but end up seeing the man claim glory. This one is equally Ranbir's and Konkona's. Yes, even though the title of the film contains the protagonist's name.For a long-long time I've been watching out for a Hindi romantic film where the story is about the lead pair. That's it. Their emotions, their turmoil and nothing else.  Love Aaj Kal was close and Wake Up Sid comes even closer. I guess some background noise is inevitable to satisfy our need-more-masala palettes. But, we are growing up as an audience and it's so heartening to see our masala-chef production houses walk hand-in-hand with us.

12,1309,1309,1309,1309,[A] Walk Among the Tombstones,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/walk-among-tombstones-review/,,3/5.0,,3.9,"Despite its sober pace, A Walk Among the Tombstones is that rare film which manages to transport you into the world it is set in. Written for the screen and directed by Scott Frank, the film also has the added benefit of having Liam Neeson play a character you don’t expect so much from him. ","Though far from perfect, writer-director Scott Frank’s A Walk Among the Tombstones, adapted from a Lawrence Block novel of the same name, comes across as a refreshing change. Perhaps it was the sight of Liam Neeson in the publicity material that caused one to fear that the film would once again have Neeson play what he’s been doing so frequently in the recent past. Thankfully enough, his character as well as the film itself are treated with rare patience.Set in the year 1999 (the period building up to the greatest of anti-climaxes, that Y2K non-event), Neeson plays Matt Scudder, a recovering alcoholic and retired (for a reason) NYPD cop who now takes up cases as a private investigator, even if he is an unlicensed one. A Walk Among the Tombstones has an intriguing air about it, all the way through. Aided greatly by Mihai Malaimare Jr. 's  cinematography, but propelled mostly by Scott Frank’s mature, stoic handling of the film, it is the atmosphere of the film that is its biggest strength. Reminiscent often of Denis Villeneuve’s Prisoners (though not nearly as haunting), the film unfolds at its own gentle pace. Apart from the mature treatment, the film also gives us a more real hero than we’ve come to expect from any Hollywood film lately, let alone one that has Liam Neeson in the lead. It is great to see him not effortlessly mowing down multiple baddies at one go, actually get beaten up a little bit himself, but still show the spirit to carry on. In one of the best scenes of the film, a man draws a knife on Scudder; the way the scene eventually plays out will surprise you, and it will underline why sometimes it makes so much sense to infuse realism into cinema.The film also gives us a pair of unlikely bad guys. David Harbour, who plays one of them, is terrific in particular. There is something chilling about the remorseless way in which they do what they do, though their background and motivations aren’t sufficiently explained. My other grouse with the film was the fact that the slow pace and spine-tingling ambiance all seemed to be building up to something that would grab at your gut, but that doesn’t quite happen. The film still will have your stomach in a knot for the most, but amping up the shock value somewhere would perhaps have served the film well.Then again, you realize that that never seemed to be the director’s intention in the first place. There’s a message or two in the film (through the character of Scudder himself, as well as his interactions with a homeless boy named T.J.); there’s a vacant, sepulchral feel that draws you in; and there’s a nice turn by a terrific actor playing a character truly worth rooting for. That was what Scott Frank always seemed to hold as his trump cards, and they’re what deliver a decent film - one that demands patience, yes, but which ultimately rewards you with that feeling of having inhabited a world outside of your own.

What then remains is for the rest of the cast and crew. And I wouldn't be surprised if the script was a donation by an unskilled well-wisher.,"When you are sitting in a multiplex and the other 559 people in the theater are whistling away to glory at each movement of the star in the film, especially the male one, you know the film's target audience. And this was not restricted to the first few minutes of the film, it continued at regular intervals through to the end. So, the Salman-followers can stop reading here and head for the theater, it's waiting to echo with your whistles.For the rest of us lesser-mortals, there ain't much going on there. It’s the gang war routine. One kills the other kills the third and so on. And a couple of turns along the way. The story is as random, unbelievable and a crazy as one could expect. Yet, the dialogues can keep you going for a while, there are some really funny lines here and there.Salman Khan has his style accompanied by the one-expression-says-it-all expression. Of course, slo-mo entries add to the spunk, as if there was any lacking. Then there's Ayesha Takia trying to cope with the speed of the film. I don't know what it is with her or maybe her image - she just doesn't fit in the typical masala role. Not to mention her wardrobe reminds me of the weird stuff doing the rounds in the 90s. And despite this, she does look really good over and above her warmth in some scenes. That one I'd give full credit to the extra layers of makeup.Also the lady can't dance. I actually felt bad for her. She was hardly ever dancing WITH Salman in the same frame. The sequence cut to her doing some simple steps every once in a while. Fair enough, not every actor need to know how to do Prabhu Deva steps. But if they can, its sheer pleasure to watch them. I was in awe of Salman and the choreographer while the first song was playing. Pure delight. Then there's the romantic thread. It has a certain quality about it, but since it doesn't go too deep, you couldn't care too much for either forming in the pair or the pair as an entity. And I guess that's not the intention either. Wanted is merry at the surface, then why would it want to go deeper?There must have been a swearing in ceremony for the cast and crew - ""I swear on the XXX, I shall not take myself seriously."" I think a similar clause applies when you buy your ticket. Me? Well, I'm not star-crazy, so I wouldn't understand the mania. But it was fun watching what people enjoy.

For obvious reasons, I am leaning towards the latter interpretation. There are way too many questions that crop up and remain unanswered. Why does Ishwar (Amtiabh Bachchan) behave a certain way for 27 years and then make a 180 degree turnaround in behavior at the most inappropriate juncture in his son's life? Why is Aadi (Akshay Kumar) such a nondescript loser despite being portrayed as smart and educated?  Why are we being asked to feel sorry for this loser? While I am at it, why is Akshay Kumar made out to be a 27 year old?If a movie is about relationships, shouldn't it, at the very least, have consistent characters involved in those relationships?  And this one should have been easier, right? It is about just one relationship, so only two characters need to be well-defined.Why anyone should try and excel at the art of making Amitabh Bachchan overact, is beyond me. I weep silently when I see the 'master of comic timing' run around trying to hit someone in an attempt to make me laugh. Director's actor and all is fine, but didn't he feel one-bit silly while saying the lamest lines ever? What did I do to deserve this? Oh sorry, this isn't about me, is it? Okay, time to snap out of ""questions"" mode.Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav as comic relief serve their purpose. They relieve you from the drudgery of bad-scripting that forms the main plot. But, the same type of joke is repeated once too often and you want relief from the jokes then. The overall plot is not a bad premise for a movie at all. But the way the details in the script have been handled is outright shabby. E.g., it is amazing that no one on the crew has ever seen how a pregnant woman is treated or behaves. No, pregnant women are not patients. They should live an active lifestyle. But, it's silly when you dance and sway around in air at one point and are not allowed to do a single household chore in the next.The redeeming factor is that you feel like slapping Aadi into reality, which means Akshay Kumar has done his job well. Of course, the assumption being that his character is meant to irritate you. And tears jerked every once in a while for a sensitively handled scene here and there. Nonetheless, in a futile attempt to please crowds, a decent story has been slaughtered with soap opera-ish situations, ridiculously placed songs, and jokes played out in skit format. And such imprudence shall not be forgiven.Alrighty then, I am off for a week-long holiday. Yep! Vacationing meetu = no review this Friday. Until next week then, hasta-la-vista...

Instead preaches. ","War films - whether they are between countries or gangs - invariably end up touching on the futility of war.  War - Chhod Na Yaar wears it as a badge of honor. Even though, the route is different because they use satire and comedy, the theme is rubbed in way too hard. True, the solution to something like the India-Pakistan war can be as simple as 'stop fighting'. If only, it were that simple though, right? Given that War Chhod Na Yaar is satire and doesn't claim to take anything seriously, it might be a tad unfair to hold its simple solutions against it. Even so, the film misses basic coherence.Behind its satirical coat, War Chhod Na Yaar can get away with the implausibility of the plot. But then, the characters, situations, and dialogue were supposed to make you laugh or at least smirk, right? For example, the initial setup of an imminent war at the border, where our protagonists are stationed, doesn't move beyond until the film is well into the second half. To keep the situations comic you have typical potshots at Pakistanis. I would like to think that even for those who find it funny, the jokes would get old within five minutes of the film. Other than that there is toilet humor and other inane one-liners. And generic references to facebook and chat do not a cool movie make. Maybe, there is an odd line here or there that could make you laugh; other than that you are just waiting for something to happen. Sharman Joshi, Javed Jaffrey, and Sanjai Mishra do bring some energy to the film. However again, their characters get repetitive and thus predictable pretty soon. Soha Ali Khan is required to feel shy, flirt with her eyes and look determined every once in a while. She does that all right. Then you have your regular dose of songs that have no business being in the film. I guess we should just be thankful that there aren't any choreographed and/or item numbers. I am all for films that speak about the power of the common man. But, War Chhodo Na Yaar is more dissuading than empowering. It is highly unlikely that the makers didn't want to inspire the audience and make them feel like they can play a role. In that case, you can only think of it as an attempt that failed. Not to mention that an entire section of the population has been totally ignored. The section that does believe that the war should be fought. Maybe, that would be another film. Hopefully not.

The film is a bit too stretched, and while the visuals are impressive and colorful, somewhere it fails to hold your emotions to its heart. ","On being released alongside this week’s Bollywood valentine flick, Ek Main aur Ekk Tu, a friend of mine had a rather snide wisecrack to make on Spielberg’s War Horse. “So essentially, War Horse is a romantic film with a horse?” he said. In my head, I decided I would make no such presumptions; that so many rights had to make for a brilliant film (the nominations, Spielberg’s sensibilities on non-human and sensitive war films – ET, Schindler’s List, Saving Private Ryan). Barring John Williams’s avalanche of a background score, and Janusz Kaminski’s beautifully visualized picture of the film, War Horse is in actuality a long-drawn, schematic film about a boy and his relationship with his horse that tries to compel you to fall in love with it. Based on the novel of the same name by British author Michael Morpugo, the film is also set at the backdrop of the World War. Albert (notable debut by Jeremy Irvine) gets attached to his purebred Joey. As the war seeps through the English countryside, his family has to sell Joey. The narrative then moves to Joey’s point of view, somewhere around 1918. He meets Emile, a French farm girl who lives with her grandfather and is a horse-owner too. The difference between the two owners is depicted beautifully from Joey’s point of view – as Albert is passionate and rustic, Emile is gentle and subtle. Celiene Buckens as Emile is a delight, often bringing in lighter moments, as she compares the two horses to two boyfriends she never had. But before we can rest with the changing narrative we are taken back to Albert’s journey – who has set out on a mission to find Joey.War Horse at many points becomes too epic, forcing you to feel the same sense of splendor that one must have felt with films like Schindler’s List. This film however, is nowhere close – the story is rather old-world and laborious, and so is the production design, sets and several moments of the performances by the lead actors. To be fair, you have to give it to Spielberg for allowing the audiences to sensitize with the non-human protagonists in his film (see ET, and now War Horse). The cinematography by Spielberg’s right arm, Janusz Kaminski is meticulous and the clear winner of the film. He manages to bring out the right play of light and colours to make the film a very pretty picture. You do feel for Joey, you move alongside him in the film, but by sheer pacing, War Horse fails to grip you. You don’t feel that lump in your throat that most World War films bring with it. The war sequences are swift and grand, reminding you of films like Kubrick’s Paths of Glory and the hues and treatment also remind you of the civil war from Gone with the Wind. The visuals are magnanimous, but somewhere in his journey to get a “wow” out of the audience for War Horse, Spielberg has lost out on the most intrinsic part of the film – connection. War Horse remains a luxuriously larger-than-life film with a potentially heart-tugging premise, which looks pastoral and splendid but becomes too long and doesn’t stay with you.

But, you expect a few more thrills from a thriller with sharks and expanses of open water.","A theme that involves a bunch of people stuck in a tight life or death situation can invoke only so much thrill. Especially, if you are exposed to thrillers.  You know some will die, some will make it. You know bad things will happen and either the characters will find a way out or not. The mystery of whether or not happens by itself isn't intriguing enough. Then what is it that hooks the audience in, if at all? Characters? Atmosphere? You need that extra spark to keep you with the film, which unfortunately is wanting in Warning. What Warning has though is an urge to do something that has rarely, if ever, been tried in Hindi films - use vast expanses of water to create a chilling atmosphere. It succeeds at times, and not so much at others but the effort to do something new is not lost on the audience. A large part of what didn't work can be attributed to the loss of brightness due to 3D. I won't say the 3D was bad, because it does shake you up a bit when a shark comes your way, if only the water was bluer maybe the film wouldn't come across as dull.True, once the situation sets in, there is hardly any up or down in the arc of the story. You have your regular drill of the blame-game, self-blame, introspection people bonding and/or fighting and so on.  There are huge group dynamics that can be explored in situations like this. But, neither the thrill element nor the human angle is touched upon more than superficially. It helps then that the actors do a decent job put together. Except for the French speaking woman who looks out-of-place, maybe intentionally, the rest of the cast goes about alternating between supportive, scared, strong, sad and so on pretty well. Another thing that worked well was the claustrophobia created by the open space that the ocean is. By the end of the film, you could feel your skin shrivel as if you were in the water for those over 1.5 hours. I don't know if I should happy then that an attempt was made or be unhappy that it wasn't taken a level deeper to engage and/or explore.

18,1315,1315,1315,1315,Warrior,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review2 Reader Reviews 5/5.0,/movie/warrior-review/,,5/5.0,,3.266666667,"Warrior is not the kind of film that builds up an excitement about it from much before you watch the film. A film about the physical and emotional battles of two brothers, the poster and trailer look intense and heavy. Admittedly, there were moments in the film which didn’t fit. But the overall effect of Warrior leaves you with a contemplative after-taste. ","When a movie, with a genre you don’t particularly care about, gets you passionately involved in a discussion about the outcome and characters – you know it’s a movie worth its money. Warrior does that to you, engaging you in a fighter film about two estranged brothers, ex-Army officer Tommy (Tom Hardy) and School teacher Brendon (Joel Edgerton). Both enter an MMA (mixed martial arts) tournament with a 5 million cash prize for different reasons. It’s a battle within a war – and it transcends to an emotional flight of two brothers. Tommy’s battling with his own demons, and the tournament for him becomes an escape. Brendon, on the other hand needs the money to prevent his home from being held by the bank.  The family’s a broken one – ex-Alcoholic father (Nick Nolte) who lives alone and two brothers who have gone their separate ways. Through the film, you can sense the complexity of each relationship. The brothers broke apart when the parents got divorced – and imaginary boundaries were formed. The father's drinking past has led him to isolation from the sons. Yet Tommy returns to be trained by his father for the tournament – and somewhere then, you know there is scope (and are hoping) for reconciliation.Does it incorporate clichés? Yes, you can expect drama and a few tears, alongside some heavy-duty MMA action. It’s the kind of sport I routinely stay away from when on TV – mostly because I never understood how someone could make a sport out of beating each other up so brutally. However with Warrior you learn to move past the fundamentals. You feel the blood and bones of the fights and you know the outcome, but that’s acceptable because it takes you with it on the journey. The treatment is a tad bit clichéd – because you know who’s going to win the fights, you know how, and while the tension is being built up between the father and the brothers, you know where you’re headed. The film works mainly because of the superb performances; clear winner remains Nick Nolte. A vulnerable yet tough ex-alcoholic and fighter, he deals with the strange turn of events in a realistically painful way. Tom Hardy is in his element, as an aggressive, emotionally burdened character – results of which show in his fighting. Joel Edgerton is heart-warming; you can feel his pain.By the climax of the film, you start to feel that the weight of the script lapses, but director Gavin O’Connor manages to divert your attention to the intense fights. The overpowering feeling of redemption hovers around the movie, and before you know, you get powerfully involved with Warrior. I’m quoting a friend here, who shared my exact sentiments of the film, “I think there’s still some scope for Hollywood”.

It sounds too good to be true, right? Well you got that right. It is a movie that sways between being a gory-action flick to a lough-out-loud comedy, and ends up being none. Even if you’re super-keen, save your money and wait for DVD. But the chances are, you’d like it even less on DVD as the only good thing about the movie is its cinematography.","The USP of The Warriors Way is gory action between Ninjas and Cowboys. With Cowboys and Aliens just around the corner, I thought all my prayers are about to be answered. For years, fans have been fantasizing about mixing two or more cults. Firefly and Cowboy Bebop are excellent examples of Space Cowboys and Blood - The Last vampire had Samurai vs Vampires. There are plenty more examples to cite - some lesser known than others. Now that Hollywood is experimenting by mixing things up, I was super-excited about The Warriors Way. I am extremely disappointed.The movie has all the tools to become a cult-blockbuster. It has an excellent cast in Dong-gun Jang (Korean superstar) as the rogue Ninja (also, the best swordsman in the history of mankind) and Geoffrey Rush as a reformed bandit (also, an ace-shooter of a cowboy). The film is produced by Barrie M. Osborne of The Lord Of The Rings franchise. Not much could have gone wrong. Correction: Not much ‘should’ have gone wrong. But a lot did. And the fault lies with the script by Sngmoo Lee and the screenplay. I can’t pick which is worse. The flashbacks come out of nowhere. The climate changes with every swing of the sword. It feels like they were really trying hard to make it a senseless flick.The first five minutes of the movie took away all the built-up excitement as they attempt to be humorous amidst gory action sequences. So you begin to think, okay its going to be one of those “From Dusk Till Dawn” (classic Cowboys vs Vampires) kind of movies. But then the movie becomes serious, and only manages to be unintentionally funny. Some of the action sequences are really well done though. I loved the last twenty minutes or so of the movie. I also loved the fact that the movements of Ninjas is quite close to those in animes (like Naruto). But visual perfection only makes up so much for everything else that’s just mediocre. You are still sitting through the shoddiest screenplay ever, and some pathetic acting by the supporting cast. Who doesn’t want to see Ninjas and Cowboys fight it out? So, I know you’re keen. But save your money, and wait for a DVD/TV release. Bonus: You can fast forward to the good parts and skip all the sad-drama in the middle.

20,1317,1317,1317,1317,Watchmen,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma reviewNotepad,/movie/watchmen-review/,,,,2.933333333,The long awaited adaptation of the famous graphic novel is a trifle disappointing.,"The Watchmen has for long remained one of the most inaccessible of the graphic novels, inaccessible when it came to transposing it to the big screen.  The novel is dense, multi textured, and works on at least three levels.   It has a plot which is highly nuanced and extremely well detailed, its characters are a far cry from the standard “super hero” genre, and its themes remain extremely contemporary and disturbing.  The audience for this movie would clearly be divided into two, those who have read the novel and would want it to be replicated down to its tiniest detail, and those who have not and who would see the film as “normal” viewers.  The former would be the legions and hordes of fans that have analysed and discussed the novel and its symbolisms, allusions, and connotations ad nauseam, while the latter would by and large have no clue about what they are to encounter.  I belong to the first group and therefore it is really difficult for me to write about the film as a “normal” viewer.  Comparisons with the novel are unavoidable, but I have tried to restrict it to a minimum.  Let me then start with the screen play.  The novel has enough material to make a mini series, but to fit into a big screen format it has been reduced to a running time of just less than three hours.  The screenplay has been pared down to the essentials that help keep the plot moving and simultaneously introduce us to the “Watchmen”, a group of “superheroes”, by way of multiple back stories and flashbacks.  A lot of detail and intricacies have been sacrificed for cinematic convenience.  The director tries to make up for this by packing a lot of cues into every frame; cues that help the viewer understand that the universe of the Watchmen is not “real”, but an imagined alternate one.  So there are news paper headlines, images on television that reference to real life incidents of the 70’s and 80’s, TV interviews, and the presence of at least five historical characters including Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger.  The title sequence is ingenious, a series of sequential images in “slow still motion”, that depict the passing of time and concomitant changes.  The entire title sequence is set to Bob Dylan’s 'The times they are a Changing', and it comes off very well.  In fact certain iconic songs are used very well in the film, Simon and Garfunkel’s 'Sounds of Silence' beautifully underscores the mood of another sequence.  What I really loved was the wailing, wrenching, Jimi Hendrix version of Bob Dylan’s apocalyptic 'All along the Watchtower', which sets the mood for the surreal climax.  The acting is top notch, the actors are “unknowns”, all barring Billy Crudup who plays Dr Manhattan, all naked, godlike, and blue to boot.  Crudup’s acting is superb, his character seems detached from human concerns, but through his soft voice and facial movements, he creates a persona that comes across as vulnerable, powerful, but yet deeply human.  Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre 2 is sometimes jarring, but she does well enough, as her role really does not demand too much.  But the prize goes to Jackie Earl Haley who plays Rorschach.  He dons a mask through out the film, we get to see his face only in the end and that too briefly, but through his hoarse rasping voice and the set of his shoulders, he conveys his uncompromising morality.  He is aided by the fact that some of the most powerful dialogues (mostly as a voice over) belong to him.   Director Zach Snyder is good with CGI, going by his previous film 300.  Here he does not overdo the special effects; the visual impact of Dr Manhattan’s character is very well done.  The film makes an effort to replicate the panels of the graphic novel as far as possible and the visual composition is very well designed. For a “superhero” movie, there are hardly any action scenes, just two to be precise, involving fisticuffs.  They seem rather redundant and are downplayed; the movie could easily have done without them. The climax is rather disappointing and this is the movie’s fatal flaw.  The climax just does not have enough punch, and it comes across as rather tame and inconsequential.   This could possibly be due to two reasons; in the novel it is the atmosphere and the ambience created that matter more than the outcome, or it could be due to the fact that the elaborate plot deals with larger metaphysical concerns which do not translate too well cinematically, or well, both.  For those who have not read the novel, the film might be difficult to grasp (this is what some of my “normal viewer” friends have told me).  But for those who have the courage, it might well be worth the effort to watch this film.  The film is good, but definitely not great.  One does get a feel of the “Watchmen” universe all right, hopefully a viewing might prompt some film goers to lay their hands on what for my money, is the best graphic novel till date.

The interdependecies between the characters are not sketched out in detail. And overall, the movie does not make an impact.","The mere sound of the phrase “plight of widows”, grips your heart. Is it then, that difficult to make a movie on this issue, which stirs you from the inside? Looks like it is. Water,  leaves you feeling cheated because you are still waiting for a punch, a hard hit on your sensibilities, even after the movie is done. The movie starts with a bang. The opening sequence makes your heart go out for little Chuyia (Sarala), the 7-8 year old widow. But, the narrative begins to fizzle out after the first ten minutes and never regains the impact. And the climax seemed very illogical. The only other touching moment comes when the lead pair has its first romantic rendezvous. Though not magical, it is very sweet.  However, you have to give it points for not being preachy or whiny. It just tells a story, and lets the audience answer the unasked question, ""Is this the way it should be?"" This movie is worth watching for its performances. Widows of different age groups having varied temperaments, have been portrayed really well. You can almost see how the younger one can be the one in the next age group when she grows older. Sarala makes you feel for her innocent but rebellious attitude. Lisa Ray, the teen widow, wants to be saved from her loveless life in the widow asylum.  Seema Biswas, plays to perfection, the role of a widow in her late 30s who has resigned to her fate, but still understands the desires of the younger widows. You can see the strength she gives them despite her internal struggle to stick to her faith, in both her expressions and her body language. Manorama, plays the classic pain-in-the-wrong-place-opportunist. Her double standards dare you to defy her. You know she has done her job well, when you feel like giving her one tight slap right across the face! Vidula Javalgekar plays a minor role of a widow (called aunty by the other widows) who is approaching the end of her life. Her mannerisms and love for food reminds you of Chunibala devi who played a very similar role in Pather Panchali. The problem is that though the individual characterization and performances don’t disappoint, most of the relationships between the individuals is underdeveloped…certainly wanting of more chemistry. Be it the relationship between Narayan (John Abraham) and Kalyani (Lisa) or Madhumati (Manorama) and Chuyia (Sarala), it was difficult to understand the motivations. E.g., Why did Narayan like Kalyani? The movie did not show any reason for Chuyia to obey Madhumati. The beginning makes you squirm and feel “oh boy! I am really going to be depressed at the end of this movie”. But, fortunately or unfortunately, that does not happen.

Good performances, though.","The “edge-of-the-seat” bit of a thriller comes from you second guessing yourself on what you think might happen. If however, you know for sure what the turnout is going to be like the edge is taken off. Yet, a hopeless hopeful like me,  waits for the unwrapping – the manner in which it will all play out. Wazir disappoints with that too.Even if you didn't figure it out, Wazir's twists are unraveled through monologues that spell out the scheme – be it by the victim or the perpetrator. That kind of resolution is one of the worst kinds in a thriller. Just because the other characters in the film are awestruck, it takes a little more to surprise the audience. Wazir can get points for making it quick though. There isn't a long-winded explanation, just short, sweet and shut. In that sense, the film is crisp and moves along pretty swiftly. It keeps you interested even though it might have meant to keep you glued. During the film for some reason, I was expecting it to break into a “khoya khoya chand”, a la Shaitan. Though I remember that one not fitting in the film and coming across as a gimmick in the context of the film. In that sense, Wazir lacks style. I know, I know, what is the poor director to do! Style comes across as gimmick when done and when missing, the viewer missed it. However, I am positive I wouldn't have missed it one bit had it been for a strong story. The chess analogies seem lame. The breadcrumbs for the “twists” are too obvious. For instance, you know a certain dialogue is being overshadowed by another one  because the former has a clue. And indeed, when the mystery unveils, the dialogue is repeated, just in case the audience needs to be spoonfed. And this is despite an inscrutable performance by Amitabh Bachchan. Of course, I mean that in a good way. A quip-less Farhan Akhtar is a little hard to take in. While it is a good change for him as an actor, as the audience you are expecting him to break into a smart-Alec line any time. Sure, that cannot be held against him, it's just that the character makes him that guy with just one expression. Aditi Rao Hydari looks gorgeous and yet again, is just that. Interestingly, though each of her roles use her as just the necessary female lead, I have wondered what she would do with a really meaty role. That leaves us with a thriller in which can tell two of the main twists from a mile away and are willing to forgive the writing because of the performances. Until the revelations come in the worst form possible. Even so, for those of us who couldn't guess the twist, Wazir might be well worth the watch.

Our big daddy is Mr. Patronizing Dialogue and soccer mom is the Great Indian Kangan. Oh yeah and our stepmom is Stepmom. ","We Are Family...hmmm the name still gave me the creeps as I entered the theater. Shrugging it off, I settled myself in for a cushy, melodramatic, soap opera - the English version of which I've seen. I wondered as I walked out, ""Does one well-made teary scene, warrant a 'good' opinion?"" I didn't have the heart to write-off a film for its thousand flaws when it managed to have one scene that touched me because it was written, performed and directed well. Even if most of the emotion is because of the way I identified with the situation, ""Oh my God! What if I'm dying and I have to tell my kids about it?"" boo-hoo-hoooo-tissue-please Ok, now that we are done with the 'credit where it's due bit', I feel liberated and let the 'ripping apart' begin!We'll start soft, just like the film. It is a mature concept and the big picture is actually non-standard considering the typical Hindi family stories. When you start watching Stepmom you feel like you have started reading a book from the middle of a chapter. We Are Family sort-of covers that gap and gives a more rounded beginning. Also, the missing backstory of the three main leads, from Stepmom, is provided briefly. And the short one or two line descriptions work perfectly. And the stage is set for a fine melodrama...or not. The performances aren't what I feared - shrieks and shrills or over-the-top. But they fail to move or get you interested, let alone involved. Mom-type Kajol; strong yet unsure, Kareena Kapoor and hunk dad Arjun Rampal show you their dilemma and the struggle, but none of them make you don't feel for them. Maybe because the characters have flaws and they are not necessarily good human beings. But they are not bad enough to hate. Awesome gray characters I've always been waiting for, but they still seem out of a book, not real human beings. And it is difficult to point out what exactly didn't work in the writing and execution of these three characters. The kids on the other hand are pretty much caricatures that are plucked from one filmy stereotype to another. Actually, I got that wrong. Not all three of them are designed that way. The little boy, has absolutely nothing to do. His middle name might as well have been, 'Haven't a clue why I exist.' The writer's cluelessness transcends  barriers of the fourth wall to haunt the audience.I don't think there was any attempt at all to make the film's events unpredictable. The trailer itself gives away the main elements of the film by way of dialogue, sequences, songs or make-up. Moreover, why would one watch We Are Family instead of Stepmom? There is hardly any value addition or Indianization. Unless you count making it with 3 kids instead of 2 and having a ""kangan"" (bangle) scene. Oops! How could I forget how they allude to the idea that woman's ultimate aim in life is to get married. And then directly go on to say that being a mother comes with the XX chromosome! Without getting into an argument about the modern woman versus the traditional idea of a woman's role in society, I'd like to say that these concepts are rather regressive. Not to mention that two women who were/are in love with the same guy are shown dancing together. I mean, I'm sure there are many women who'd get along that way, but here it wasn't convincing enough. The concept of We Are Familyconstantly reminded me of what I remember as a beautiful film, Mere Baad where Rakhee Gulzar plays a mom of four kids. It's a soul-touching film about how she goes about looking for foster parents for her kids after she's diagnosed with a fatal disease. No, We Are Family is nowhere close to being that sensitive, but I suddenly feel like digging that one out. Any pointers for where to start?

The administration, in turn, turning all its resources up-side-down. We've seen this and a lot more in Hollywood. But, when you take this basic plot, add some very basic action to it, cast the most wonderful cast you could have, you have me arrested - not wanting to blink once.I like to observe how the titles of a movie are done, because in a way, it’s a measure of how much respect the decision makers have for their crew. Many a time there's so much noise and glitter during the titles that you are forced to not read the opening credits. So, when half of A Wednesday's titles are plain white text on black background with zero sound, I am hooked. There's one scene where the person threatening to set-off bombs is very close to being caught. At that point, I was wondering how cool it'd be if he's actually caught at this point, wonder how the story will move on. And at the very same time, I was sincerely hoping that he escapes. Just in case, his capture would mean that the movie is close to its end. I hadn't even realized that it's not even interval yet, that's how much I was enjoying the thrill and the build-up.While introducing its characters to us, A Wednesday also takes digs at the influence of ""stars"" in our film industry, gender bias in our society, ""creation"" of news by our media, and the general attitude of our law and order officials. Along the way, it comments on the impotency of our law enforcement department (though, it was refreshing to see a room full of committed police officers). And as a final bang, very smartly, the plot uses the same impotency to make right right. Just less than 24 hours ago, I was applauding a director's effort to give Anupam Kher a non-loud, meaningful role. And here we have a movie which has him as the protagonist. Sure, it doesn't require him to go through the whole range of expressions an actor - particularly this one - is capable of. But what it gives him back is our - his audience's - respect. What can I say about Naseeruddin Shah - I was just left speechless by his character's confidence and angst, whether ill-placed or not. Even though, thrillers are not necessarily the best genre to display acting prowess. Anupam Kher and Jimmy Shergill are what I call the soft faces in the film fraternity. However, stern their characters, you expect them to soften up sooner or later. But they have such strong attitudes here, that when you see Anupam Kher and even Jimmy beat someone up, you don't question it. Both the writing and the performances complement each other. The smaller side characters also have their charm. Like, the young self-made hacker was cute. Yep! I actually found a geek adorable. Speaking of which, except for the amusing graphics on the screen, the other technical talk didn’t sound like mumbo-jumbo.The melodramatic background score used to create suspense and the overdramatic slo-mo stylization of Naseeruddin Shah's character are about the only things that irritated me. From the tone of the movie otherwise, especially the muted titles, I got the feel that this excessive drama was not based on creative decisions from the heart but the director resorted to them because he was supposed to. Surprisingly though, the speech in the climax didn't get tiringly preachy. That's mostly because the motivations sounded novel yet believable.Anupam Kher and Naseerudin Shah - truly a pleasure to see you on the screen together, sirs! That too in a thriller...

Each scene outdoes the previous one in defying your belief in any kind of sense. No amount of good acting can help save the careless writing.,"Why are we supposed to be entertained by suspending our sense of reason? Why is a few laughs considered ""worth it""? Why is ""time-pass"" good enough? Why is one forced sequence after another called a script? Why is comedy dictating the situation, instead of comedy flowing from the situation?Save a couple of one-liners here and there, there's nothing enjoyable about this slapstick. Unless you are the kind who enjoys patting yourself on being able to accurately predict what the writers have in store. The male cast does not surprise, in that they do exactly what they have been doing in every slapstick. So, while they do their bit well, not many viewers would object to them choosing worthier scripts.  Except for Feroz Khan. It almost felt like the makers didn’t think anyone in the cast was worthy of first billing. So they got Feroz Khan to blow his trumpet to justify and take the lead in the opening credits. Katrina Kaif fulfills expectations. She satisfactorily basks in the glory of the light thrown on her and giggles to fill in for lack of lines. Mallika Sherawat on the other hand, seriously does well as the designated flirt of the movie.Technically the movie is plain awful. To start off, it makes liberal, blatant, and shabby use of the blue screen. It might have been just about acceptable if it were just the first two. But in combination with the third the visuals are just disastrous. The camera work, especially in the beginning, looked like the cameraman was testing out the properties of a wide angle lens. The non-existent editing just adds to the woes. Continuity gets step-sisterly treatment a little too often. No effort seems to have been taken even to match the colors between shots in a few sequences.Some of the songs were chopped off absolutely abruptly too. Not to mention that their placement makes no sense whatsoever. And what a waste of Malaika Arora's dancing skills! Why did they refuse to spend on decent choreography instead of the cameraman's voyeurism? Okay, you don't need to answer that.I trash another slapstick. What more could you expect from a person who can't enjoy masala movies even after disowning logic?

The rest of the film is tacky with a story line that's all over the place. ,"Any intrigue that the witty dialogue and unusual story line from the trailer might have created is thwarted with the tacky opening credit sequence and loud initial few minutes. Yet a hopeful viewer waits for the real story to kick in. Even when that happens, it doesn't take off from there and that is a real shame. Because, the premise could really have been exploited – both because it is new and by itself has a lot of meat that can be sliced and diced in many different ways - the two Indians find themselves in Pakistan.But, the route chosen – loud and all-over-the-place – is more a reminder of a run-of-the-mill Hindi slapstick that has neither head nor tail and just meanders about. Instead, you'd expect more satire from a movie that has such a political context. Welcome 2 Karachi botches up individual scenes that could have been remarkably funny, insightful and satirical too. Usually, with Arshad Warsi in the mix, you are at the very least guaranteed good comic timing. While there are a couple of laugh out loud moments (especially if you haven't seen the trailer), for the rest, Arshad Warsi comes across as loud and insufferable. Jacky Bhagnani brings in a laugh or two too, but I couldn't figure out why he seemed drunk through the film. While I understand, he was supposedly playing stupid, he came across more as a stupid person who sways a little too much for a person who has had his last drink a few days ago. Again, these few scenes that work, have no context whatsoever.Similarly, I understand films of this nature work on shoe-string budgets. Even so, the production is too tacky. We have many a example to show that limited resources do not necessarily have to mean cheap/cheesy visuals. Welcome 2 Karachi ends up being one of those that make you go, “What on earth is going on!?”and even when you are expecting the worst you want to yell, “This is not what I had signed up for.”

At interval, a tentative girl apologized to the boy accompanying her to the movie and asked if he wanted to leave. That was the only thing that made me laugh while watching Welcome Back. ","I think, I've seen it all now. Dimple Kapadia goes all slapstick-y. A fine actor turns to over-the-top acting to play an  ill-defined character. Nothing else can be as repulsive.  By now, we have gotten used to some of the other actors – Paresh Rawal, Nana Patekar and even Naseeruddin Shah once in a while - showing up in a film that considers even scratching the surface of their acting capabilities a crime. Getting a dignified actress like Dimple Kapadia to do so feels like a hit under the audience's belt. It doesn't come as a surprise that she is the most restrained of them all. The other two main women in the film, Shruti Haasan and Ankita Srivastava are miraculously both central to the plot and completely irrelevant. If you can call a reformed goons, Uday (Nana Patekar) and Majnu (Anil Kapoor) finding himself a new sister to be married off a plot at all. In the first hour of the film or so, there seemed to be some coherence because everything that happened somehow revolved around getting the sister or themselves married. After a couple of rounds of sexual objectification and standing up against it, it all boils down to one thing – getting married.Even the bigger goon, Wanted, yeah, that's his name (Naseeruddin Shah) is also focussed on getting his son married off. The son, is played by no less than Shiney Ahuja, wh o goes over board in being over board about anything he does in the film. As the movie moves into its last half hour or so though, everything becomes more and more bizarre. By now, the writers have even stopped trying to make sense. Sure, that was only a matter of time.  I really don't know what to say. Why anyone thinks any of this is even remotely funny, I don't understand. Even the one-liners are WhatsApp forwards. A couple rare lines bring a smile. Sure, there were a few laughters in the theater. But, if I had to guess it would be more because they were laughing at the film rather than with it.

The style of narration is a bit artificial but makes for an interesting watch.,"""Knock-knock""
""Anyone there?""
""You...you the multiplex cine-goer...yeah, yeah you - we've made this for you...a collage of the horrors that the interiors of the country suffers from...
""Worry not dearies, we've masked it with a dose of humor to make it palatable.""Yes, Welcome to Sajjanpur is here to educate us of the situation in rural India, with a slightly patronizing tone. And it does a good job of it too. The seriousness is toned down with wit albeit slapsticky at a few places. It tries to sensitize without being overtly sensitive. Which is why villagers might find their issues being trivialized.  Issues that they have to grapple with in on a day-to-day basis. Without any qualms, the movie refuses to offer solutions. ""That's not our job"", it says. We have just taken it upon ourselves to let you know this is what's happening in there. Look here, a mere signature is literacy in the census, animal rights are taking precedence over human livelihood, ""widow remarriage"" is a privilege. Sure, you knew that superstition and blind faith seep through the country's veins, that 'politician' is synonymous with 'goon' and farmers sell organs to keep afloat. But, might as well reinforce their existence. Oh, by the way, while we are at it, let us remind you that there is no need to shake off a eunuch with disgust! You know what, though, all these things don't necessarily have to end badly, there are alternative outcomes.That's a whole lot of ground to cover. Using one or two colorful, relatively well-etched out characters each, Benegal highlights issue after issue to form the montage of a village, Sajjanpur. The narrative tone topped up with a border-line loud Shreyas Talpade started getting to me in the first 10 minutes. And throughout, I was wondering, ""why this tone?"" Why are characters disappearing? My suggestion, don't be fidgety like me, there's a reason for that and you'll know when you need to know. Similarly, the songs add to the unrealistic feel. Besides doing their bit to maintain the light tone of the film, they are the way they are for a reason. I'd just enjoy the rhythm that adds to the mood of the village - this group of people who don't lose their smile despite the trying circumstances.Flipside, of course, is that they add to the length of the movie. And that's one place where Welcome to Sajjanpur misses the mark big time. It needed to be at least 15-20 minutes shorter. And this is despite the climax being rushed up. Maybe they were just trying something different in the narrative style, but it felt like a quick fix.The other thing was the accent. For some reason, it came across as forced. One reason could be that Rajeshwari Sachdev and Amrita Rao have a city-bred image that is difficult to shake off. Add to that the fact that they show up in non-village-like attire every once in a while. While Amrita was charming as the wife pining for her husband to come back to her, Rajeshwari looked really uncomfortable in the whole set-up. Smart-alec with a heart, Mahadev (Shreyas Talpade), keeps you curious throughout. How is he going to put his emotions in the next letter he writes for one of the villagers? You want his dreams to come true, however murky the morals behind them be. Am I the only one who thinks Shreyas does an Amol Palekar every once in a while? Each of the other cast members too adds his/her flavor to the village ambience. But, one who stood out was Ila Arun. I can so imagine her as one of my aunts from my native village. You read the newspaper and go on with your day. You'll, in all probability, watch this movie, maybe applaud the effort, and go on with your life. There will be no long-lasting impact, but maybe, just maybe the stories will stay with you.

Well done Abba reminds us of that and more. It reminds us of the gravity, the irony and our own submissiveness to the whole do. Would have worked much better if it were about an hour shorter.","Anyone who has spent even a little time in trying to get any work done from a corrupt, bureaucratic government will relate with the film. The issue at hand here might be more serious and even larger, but it's easy to identify with the protagonists, Armaan Ali (Boman Irani) and Muskaan (Minissha Lamba). A standard beginning that sets the tone for the narrative; a slow and frustrating build-up - as if we should feel the characters' emotions; an interesting twist post-interval; a few irrelevant sub-plots; and an out-of-place climax make the film just about watchable.The only reason to watch the film would be to take a peek into the exasperating process of getting any administrative work done that involves government approvals and the trick used to show the system the mirror. The funniest bit is that, like one would expect, the the bureaucrats' and politicians' completely see through the point. Master stroke in the sotry-writing department. The most fascinating element for me in the film was the Andhra accent in which Hindi is spoken. It completely highlights the rural setting too. Having spent a lot of my summer vacations in that region, the language brought along its share of nostalgia and thus fondness. That doesn't make the language or dialect consistent, but it is used well in large parts. The dialogues are plain-speak and yet not the boring types. They keep you engaged through. The other department that makes this film worth its while is the performances. Minissha Lamba is simply brilliant as the strong-headed village girl. Both, her language and her looks are completely in tune with her character. Boman Irani too is completely convincing, but we wouldn't have suspected that anyway, right? The put-offs though were the various side-plots. The milieu here is very similar to that in Welcome to Sajjanpur by the same director. But the not-so-main stories in that one were extremely engaging. Here they are extremely annoying. Right from the Engineers lust for his wife, to the woman-trade, to the look-alike brother. They took away more than what they added to the ambience. These plots also lengthened the film by a lot more than what could have been a brilliant light film on a serious issue. Though they might have served the purpose of adding a few more smiles because I did hear a lot of laughter from the audience. I'd suggest a wait until the movie is out on TV/DVD just because it does call for the patient audience in you. The treatment given to the dry subject is refreshing and won't be a complete waste of time.

West is West offers nothing new, it’s a passable watch for when you’re bored on a weekend and want to be amused but it shouldn’t be taken as anything more than that.  ","It’s raining sequels this season; you should buy an additional umbrella that can hold that burden. It’s not new to love an original and to have a sequel forced down your throat. Ayub Khan-Din scripted East is Easy in 1999 was one of the first British-Asian films to open the possibilities of that amusing premise - an Indian family living in the west and more such idiosyncrasies. The kids of the Khan family have it worse. Their mom is English and dad is a Pakistani patriarch. After a successful run, the movie opened up a good avenue for West is West  – which had some promising promos.
West is West  is like a hangover, no pun intended. It’s formulaic, and predictable. In West is West, Om Puri brings his youngest son, Sajid (Aqib Khan) to Pakistan because he feels he needs to inculcate some Pakistani culture into him. He deports him to his First wife’s home in a village in Pakistan where he hopes that Sajid will learn some values and morals. It all turns upside down when his holiday turns into a nostalgic overstay and Sajid begins to settle as a village boy. Barring a few scenes here and there, the movie drags and the latter half becomes preachy and boring. Om Puri has a comic charm, which lasts for about 45 mins of the film after which you can almost foresee every event play out. The scenes that are funny, stand alone – jibes at the multiple relations in a Muslim household, lifestyle shifts between England and Pakistan, all make for hilarious 5-minute scenes. You could watch them on youtube over and over and be amused, but added to a film and it gets lost in the whirlpool. Quick note about the soundtrack of the film – the Sufi sound will make you feel like you’re listening to Coke Studio, coupled with a few scenes that describe the serenity of Sufi music only to be best experienced in this side of the world. It’s a well-executed vision, provided a peaceful respite to the otherwise confused commotion of the film. Director Andy De-Emmony isn’t looking to expose to his audience to the harsh realities of British Muslims – it’s not a deep film. You can laugh, and light-heartedly pull through 2 hours and walk out feeling amused but it gets stuck somewhere between a drama and a comedy. To top it all, West is West is also sprinkled with a few run-of-the-mill Asian, cultural stereotypes. It’s a film that has a confused target audience and confused genre – and a cinematic confusion is not the same as a confused identity that stands on its own as a fundamental for culturally mixed films. If anything, West is West  gives a preachy and only brief account of the theme that is quite rich for any Brit-Asian comedy: an identity crisis.The characters are strong, be it English wife Ella (Linda Bassett) Sajid’s mother, George Khan (Om Puri) or even Ila Arun as Puri’s first wife – but together they only make for a passable watch. West is West  is not a bad film, it’s enjoyable for a lazy watch, but I would recommend the much funnier and sharper prequel East is East. It serves the same purpose better if you’re looking for a lazy watch.

The film revels in its predictability, making no attempt to try a different brand of humour or a different revelation of human experience. While some moments have the potential to make you laugh, for the most part the movie is banal and unsatisfactory.","What you expect from What to Expect When You’re Expecting doesn’t falter one bit through the 110 minutes of the film. The film is adapted by the non-fiction book of the same name and its main draw, much like other ensemble films like He’s Just Not that Into You and New Year’s Eve is the variety of familiar faces, (gorgeous Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lopez playing pregnant woman who look cosmetically flawless) virtually no character-viewer relationship, some funny moments and a predictable story-line. Based in New York, the film graphs seven couples who have one thing in common - they’re all having a baby. Soon they realize that pregnancy is harder than they imagined. The many characters include Cameron Diaz, a fitness guru celebrity who winds up with an unexpected pregnancy. While Jennifer Lopez finds trouble adopting a child after having difficulty in conceiving, Elizabeth Banks preaches on a perfect pregnancy but all her rules go topsy-turvy when she’s expecting, and Chace Crawford (Gossip girl fame) and Anna Kendrick (of the Twilight saga) play ex-lovers who reunite to result in an accidental pregnancy. The movie does have its funny moments though – mostly to Elizabeth Bank’s credit, where she plays the uptight mommy-to-be who becomes a chaotic mess by the d-day. Her trail is the funniest to follow, and you find yourself waiting for her bit to pop up amidst the ensemble. On the flipside, most of the humor adopted for the bigger stars like Diaz and Lopez seem repetitive and remind you of an American sitcom.The film, predictably so, relies on many clichés - the beautiful first touch of a new-born baby, the surge of emotions that a mommy-to-be faces and the parallel track of the husbands, which I would have preferred to be more inclusive. As it is, the husbands are quite negligible, and much to our disappointment most of the couple are pretty straightforward. No gay couple or even inter-racial couples for that matter. A cultural or homosexual complexity while having a child could have provided fodder for further humor. The film unfolds mostly through predictable background score and you can virtually check off every cliché being used in the film: every trouble is eventually justified with the larger joy of being a mother, the character who has the most trouble ends up with the happiest ending and the actual act of conceiving is as glamorous and colorful as the posters of the film. Being the biggest stars in the film, Lopez and Diaz mostly disappoint with the plastic performances.If what you’re looking for is a happy-fun film with many faces and characters I suggest you rent Love Actually. What to Expect When You’re Expecting is a disappointment.

The rest - story / songs / execution - all are just about o-kay. And mainly because it requires this WARNING! It is all of 3.5 hours. An option is to treat is as 2 proper length films or 12 short films,"Let's get the obvious complaint out of the way. What's you Rashee? is long, super-long, super-duper long. No. Just ""super-duper long"" wouldn't be enough. It needed that build-up, it's that long! AND despite that, it's not an outright bad film, but it keeps it from being an ""undoubtedly great"" one. Oh, well…Let' get the second-most obvious thing about the film. This time a sure positive one. PRIYANKA CHOPRA. I'm usually more than okay with people not agreeing with my opinion of a film/performance/etc. But, I will be really surprised if there are more than meager handfuls who won't like Priyanka Chopra in this film. I had enough guys going siggggh and gals going wow (including me) every time she was on screen. Her performance(s) were brilliant one charming character after another. The third-most…Gotchya! You didn't think I was giving you a list of top 12 things about What's your rashee?, were you? But if I were to do that I'd guarantee, each paragraph sounded and talked about different things. Which is not what the 12 Priyanka characters do here. Yes, almost each of the 12 characters is charming, and a couple of them are very different from the norm. But the rest follow a format. There's something they want their groom-to-be or not-to-be to know and each Priyanka's 10 minutes of screen-time revolves around that issue. And this is extremely interesting for the first few times and obviously tiring after that. And the two that are different are too exaggerated to be true. Which is pretty much true of the entire story-line too. But the basic premise has been forgiven since we are already there to watch the film, right? And despite that we are asked for more. We have to accept the dad's selfishness and the brother's foolishness, the silly pundit and weird uncle, the prop sister-in-law and the I'm-here-to-lengthen-the-film aunt. Ooops! I almost forgot Harman Baweja. I surprise myself when I want to say, I think this guy can do well. He needs a chance where he's not over-shadowed by his star co-star. But, this one is all about the woman, right? Wrong. My issue with these so-called women-oriented films is also that they are well ""so-called"". While each one of the characters is today's girl with a mind of her own, it looks superficial. Because, she's still out for the man's support in needing what she wants and each one's approach is convoluted. And if there was ever a ""throw me around from one guy to the other, how do I care which man I want to get married to"", this is the one. Wait for the climax to react to this comment. This is what the writer's thinking process looks like. 
""Yo! Priyanka Chopra is one helluva actor. She needs a film that revolves under her character."" 
. 
. 
. 
""But, we don't know how to write women-centric stories. Damn! That too for someone with a star stature."" 
. 
. 
. 
""Let's go through options that we can explore. 7 days of the week, naah - sounds ridiculous. 31 days of the month - way too many. So 365 days a year is out of the question….hmmm…""
. 
. 
 Research - research - research  (am I giving too much credit? Well, the same man made the supposedly extensively researched Jodhaa Akbar, didn't he? Anyway... 
. 
. 
""Hey, look here's this Gujrati novel Kimball Ravenswood by Madhu Rye. Yay! Jackpot And they made a TV series out of the same theme and it was pretty popular, remember? Mr. Yogi? ""
. 
. 
. 
""Done, then! Since we've to get Priyanka to act real well, and she'll sell. The director can leave the rest of the cast to do their own thing, snort, fart, smile, whine, whatever. And he can focus on just the lady."" 
. 
. 
. 
""Hey, wait! 12 girls one after the other without a break will become monotonous. Let's throw in a couple of side-stories. Which ones? Don't matter. Say a Don theme and an extra-marital affair theme. It'll just break the flow for a bit. Doesn't sound good? I said ""Don't matter!!"" It don't matter even if we don't give them a closure. You just watch…""
. 
. 
. 
""What else? It's masala no? We need songs. How many? Of course 12! Can't have any less, what if any one of Bhavna, Hansa, Anjali, Chandrika, Sanjana, etc, etc, etc feel bad? Can't risk that!"" And so we have what we have. An extremely mediocre product if it were not for Ms. Piggy Chops. True, the songs are nice, very well-picturized and different too. But after the 3rd one it gets a little blah! And when there are so many, songs with lip-sync involved they sound repetitious too. Gone are the days Mr. Gowariker when the Hindi film audience thought found their money's worth only if the film touched the 180-minute mark. Rest assured we, the audience, won't think any less of you if your movie doesn't move the average run-time of films around the world by a notch. Yet, it's not boring. So, viewers will be better equipped to handle its length at home with the luxury of the ""fast forward"" switch at their disposal for the non-Priyanka parts, of course. Oh yeah and the opening credits are one of the best I've seen in Hindi films!

A simple, uncomplicated film about taxi driver Hari and his wedding, the film otherwise doesn’t offer much else, because of the manner in which the filmmakers have adhered to their objective – the story of when Hari got married.","Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam’s documentary When Hari Got Married is a simple and unassuming film that follows 30-year old taxi driver Hari in the lead up to his arranged marriage. While the film does warm your heart, I’m still grappling with whether I want to recommend the film or not.Hari is set to marry a young girl named Suman. Though the couple doesn’t ever get the chance to spend any time together prior to their marriage, Hari manages to get hold of Suman’s phone number. Thus ensuring at least some level of ‘courtship’. The phone conversations that Hari has with Suman and Hari’s narration of his experiences as he goes through with the wedding preparations make you smile. Hari is resourceful and smart, yes. But he is also a simpleton, almost naïve. (Then again, that naivety may only be an urban writer’s perception of him, based on a few nuggets of his life captured on video.) As the film follows Hari and we acquaint ourselves with his uncomplicated worldview, we see just how traditional most of India still is.In fact, traditionalism and conservativeness apart, what comes through the most in the film is just how deep gender biases have penetrated our society. Suman, for example, properly sets eyes on Hari for the first time when she is actually getting married to him. It is endearing and a little heart-breaking to think of that diminutive little woman getting ready to spend her life with a man who she wouldn’t recognize unless he was pointed out to her.Even Hari, a good man no doubt, still seems to think that the wedding is an ordeal for the man more than the woman. He gives off the air of someone who is about to accept a burden more than anything else. And it isn’t his fault really; it is about his surroundings and where he comes from.Credit, then, to the filmmakers Sarin and Sonam, who don’t try to milk the story for any sensationalism or for highlighting any burning issues plaguing small-town India. Their focus is Hari and his wedding, and everything else is about the flavour and texture of all that goes with it and the place and culture of where the film is set. The film, then, is more like a wedding video than anything else.And that, primarily, is what causes me to be unsure of how much I should recommend this film. It is honest, endearing and mature, but what does one truly take away from the film, apart from the fact that we know Hari and Suman had an arranged marriage? Little else, to be honest. Personally speaking, though, I’m glad that I now know about the existence of Hari, Suman and their angelic daughter somewhere in the hills of Dharamsala; because they will find a place in my prayers henceforth.

Where is The Friend’s Home  is like visual poetry, recited by Ahmed, the protagonist about his adventures to a neighbouring village. More than coaxing you to watch the film because it’ll be one of the best you’d have seen, it’s more a small part of innocence that you should revisit. You might be able to retain it for a couple of hours after the film. ","If you check your inbox from the early 2000s, you would definitely find one of those cheesy, forwarded emails that gives you a pictorial list of the most precious things on earth. You know, the smell of rain, the dewdrop on a rose and yes ofcourse, a child’s innocence. Before you cringe at the thought of it, you should know that Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami’s Where is The Friend’s Home will break that cringe and make you fall in love with the concept of innocence all over again.Where is The Friend’s Home  is set in rural Iran, and tells us a simple story of a small boy who travels all the way to another village to return his friend’s notebook. We are introduced to the atrocities of small-town education that relies on it’s strict discipline, sort reminiscent of Truffaut’s 400 Blows. We walk through our protagonist Ahmed’s life, to find that at the end of a hard day at school, he happened to bring his friend’s notebook home. Well aware of the consequences of not finishing your homework in your notebook, Ahmed decides to visit the neighbouring village to return his notebook. Only, he doesn’t know the way. But that doesn’t stop Ahmed; his empathy towards his friends pulls him beyond selfish logic and we follow him on his journey to the neighbouring village. The picture of Where is The Friend’s Home is stunning, in a simplistic way. While we follow Ahmed, we walk with him through unknown zig-zag roads, amidst the rural landscape of Iran. Much like most Iranian films, we venture on a poetic, visual journey coupled with a middle-eastern stringed background score and a slow-paced rhythmic movement towards the friend’s home. By the end of the journey, you feel you know Ahmed much more than his parents of the elders, like you and Ahmed share a secret bond, of the pleasures of expedition you got to accompany him on. So much so, that the 83 minutes whiz by even though most of the film is shot on real time. Ahmed and the elders in a village have the conventional conflict in their ideologies. We see a more experimental, innocent yet observant viewpoint of Ahmed juxtaposed with the traditional values of his mother or his grandfather. But you don’t have to make a choice. You’re never made to leave Ahmed’s side. The DVD of Where is The Friend’s Home has no special features but it comes in a pack of three – The Koker Trilogy, which also includes And Life Goes On and Through The Olive Trees. All three are based in the village Koker, and surround the same characters. Yet with Where is The Friend’s Home you won’t feel like you watched a film. You’ll have transported yourself on Ahmed’s shoulder for 83 mins, walking and contemplating and absorbing every bit of his experience. I would ask you to explore the child-like innocence in you with this film, or realize the beauty of a simple story but as the cliché goes, the film offers you much more. It’s like you’ve been made to close your eyes and visualize a story being played out as a young Iranian boy narrates it to you. How you chose to visualize Where is The Friend’s Home becomes your viewing experience of the film. It’s really that beautifully simple.

Doused with cheese, imbecility trumps all in a film where you actually end up feeling sorry for America at the end of it, never mind the fact that its jingoistic patriotism comes to its rescue after all.","Unbelievable, really. Barely a few months after Antoine Fuqua’s Gerard Butler-starrer, Olympus Has Fallen, disgraced the big screen with its cheesy, jingoistic, all-American, guiltily indulgent ludicrousness, Roland Emmerich gives us White House Down - a film with, yes, almost the exact same plot, just with the asininity up several notches. The White House is taken over by terrorists, as simple as that. At least Olympus Has Fallen tried to maintain a level of respect towards the constitution and the office of the President of the United States of America. White House Down, though, is all-out idiocy of an astonishing level. It dials up absolutely everything idiotic about Olympus, adds in more than a few puerile moments of its own, and serves us a harebrained film that trips over its own preposterousness while trying to outrun its own half-wittedness. This is the kind of film where a lollipop-sucking computer hacker gets to work only after setting up a Beethoven symphony, and where an affable White House tour guide miraculously manages to invoke Arnold Schwarzenegger when a shotgun comes his way. Now Roland Emmerich has never been known to make particularly intelligent films anyway, preferring to use his $100-million-plus budgets to blow things up or making things come crashing down. Incidentally, with his last film Anonymous, made on a measly $30 million budget, it seemed like he was beginning to tilt slightly towards some substance in his films. That one was, for me, his best film to date despite it being just as outlandish as his usual work. But he’s back with big-budget vengeance and how! Channeling his inner Abbas & Mastan, Emmerich packs the plot in with a twist a minute, completely avoids any space-time coherence, provides ace military-grade stealth skills to an eleven-year old girl, takes special care to ensure that none of the thousand-odd bullets fired at our heroes ever touches them and packs the film with inane humour throughout its runtime; so much so that I’m hard-pressed to not slot this film as a comedy. It also pretends to be a coming of paternal-age drama at times, and it is here when it becomes particularly hard to not gag.The real travesty of this film is how some really fine actors are given such thankless characters to enact. Jamie Foxx as POTUS collects every ounce of Barack Obama’s poise and statesmanship, so that he can chew it all up like a giant bubblegum and spit it out onto the front lawn of the White House, ensuring that he carries absolutely none of it into the film. He’d have made for an amusing sidekick janitor at the White House in another film. As the ‘leader of the free world’ though - as he once refers to himself in this one - he does best when he isn’t on screen.Jason Clarke, coming off the back of three terrific turns in Lawless, Zero Dark Thirty and The Great Gatsby, is saddled with a negative role far beneath his talent and presence. Maggie Gyllenhaal goes so over-the-top that you wish more than once that she had stayed dead after The Dark Knight. Channing Tatum as an aspiring Secret Service agent who’s trying his best to impress his daughter, offers up a measure of macho schoolboy charm, but there is only so much he can do to keep a straight face during all of what’s happening around him.White House Down is the kind of film that you stop taking seriously very soon, hoping that it will turn out to at least be a brisk, fun film. Alas, it rarely becomes anything more than a good exercise at testing just how many synonyms of the word ‘moronic’ you can think of.

How I wish the rest of the movie was executed that skillfully too. For die-hard movie buffs just the first few minutes make it a must-watch in theatre. For the less-inclined, there are good moments, but there is no glitter-dance-colour-cinematography. Certainly wait for a somber mood to see this one. All songs other than the one in the second half have good music and beautiful poetry. 
No one need tell the story – thanks to the marketing department that left no stone unturned in publicizing it as the Mahesh Bhatt-Parveen Babi love story. The story leaves a pretty big gap which makes you feel cheated. It feels like the first half is made with so much devotion and involvement that suddenly, the team wakes up…oops!!!…no time and money left to say it all, so let’s skip this part here. 
Shiney Ahuja has given a laudable performance. You really feel for him right till the end.  Kangna Ranaut’s dialogue delivery needs polishing, a lot of it! Also, either the dubbing is off, or she is trying to hide a lisp. The role required someone to shed clothes, and they found someone who had no inhibitions whatsoever, so what if even after make-up her face looks patchy. 
Almost everything loses its way after half time. The reasonable dialogues are followed by inane ones. Really charged scenes give way to drab direction. The screenplay loses the slickness it had in the first half. Also, while some aspects of schizophrenia have been portrayed very well, others like side effects of medication, why a patient resists medication, etc are completely ignored. 
This is one of those two-hours-and-a-few-minutes movies which makes you feel you have been sitting in that seat for more than three hours. If the audience is laughing out loud at serious scenes, you know they have been there too long. 
Am I being insensitive by calling a supposedly sincere attempt to pay a tribute to Parveen Babi a marketing strategy? My thought while leaving the cinema hall – can anyone who was so deeply in love, make an exhibition out of it?

37,1334,1334,1334,1334,[The] Wolf of Wall Street,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/wolf-wall-street-review/,,,,2.95,"Martin Scorsese shows the world how it's done, once again. A crazy ride of questionable morals, The Wolf of Wall Street shows us the escapades of a greedy libertine in a manner that makes you see through your own righteousness. Entertaining, hilarious and downright vulgar, Scorsese at the helm and DiCaprio's turn as the titular character make for quite a film. ","We live rather tame lives, if you really think about it. Years of conditioning about what's right and what's wrong; the pangs of guilt or, alternatively, the adrenaline rush one gets when one crosses a moral 'line'; passing moral judgements about the other; penance for one's 'sins'; the works. Humanity lives by a code of ethics that, at least for the most part, seems to work for us.  But then, who really writes this 'code'? Who makes the rules, and if we go by the fundamental premise that all of humankind is equal, then who's to say what defines right and wrong in the first place? After all, one man's food is another man's poison. Consequently, there will always be those who live life by their own rules, all notions of morality be damned. These people, usually, are the ones who aren't accountable for their Aston Martins.Enter Jordan Belfort - Wall Street stockbroker and salesman extraordinaire - a man who made millions by laundering fraudulent stocks to unsuspecting investors. A self-styled Robin Hood who took wealth from the rich and gave it to... Himself! A man who made so much money that he didn't mind throwing cash in the trash, just for kicks.Based on the book 'The Wolf of Wall Street' written by the real life Belfort himself, Martin Scorsese's film adaptation of the scamster's life is an astonishingly audacious piece of cinema - both in content as well as execution. With the film largely based on fact, one can't help but be overwhelmed by just how obscene Belfort's greed, depravity, lasciviousness and lust for money was; and that lust just grew bigger with each additional million he made. Jordan Belfort didn't just push the limits of morality, he ignored them completely, seeming to live in an alternate dimension where morality as a concept just didn't exist.Then there's what Martin Scorsese has done with Belfort's story. Call it glorification, call it treating a serious issue with a far lighter tone than can be considered appropriate, or call it sheer masterclass in adopting a cinematic style that will work best with the written word - either way, Scorsese knocks this one out of the park the way only he can.Directed with a kind of fervent energy that one hasn't seen from the great man in a while, The Wolf of Wall Street is cinema on crack. Outrageously funny, incredibly daring in terms of how it never shies away from going deeper and deeper into the realms of 'immorality', briskly paced to the extent that one never realizes its monstrous runtime, and phenomenally performed to boot, The Wolf of Wall Street will either be the most fun you've had at the cinemas in a while, or if the vulgarity of Belfort's excesses begin to get to you, it can also be the most taxing experience in recent times.Because make no mistake, neither Martin Scorsese nor his terrific cast have held themselves back with this one; they've gone all out to bring you characters that make you question everything you believe in. Sex, violence, drugs, language, corruption, immorality and everything considered taboo are actually celebrated with uncontrolled licentiousness in the film. In fact, despite the fact that the film has been released in India with a good six minutes chopped off, I still couldn't help wonder how the censors were mature enough to let the film release at all - not that I'm complaining. It is rated as an adult film, obviously, but I know for a fact that even many 'adults' will find it hard to stomach the level of all-round immodest extravagance of sin that has been depicted in the film.Of the cast, Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort and Jonah Hill as his aide Donnie give their characters their unbridled all. DiCaprio, in particular, must be saluted for pumping Belfort with a quality that makes him seem 'normal', despite his excesses. They should be someone we despise, but we are never allowed to take a moral stance with them. DiCaprio - and Scorsese, of course, - make you an unsuspecting participant in everything that you would ideally consider 'wrong', which consequently shakes you off from your own moral high ground, bringing your self-righteousness crashing down.Questions will be asked, of course. Is it right to glorify something that is so obviously 'wrong'? Should there have been a stronger focus on highlighting that sin must always be atoned for; that karma will come back to bite you in the backside some day? Is a film like The Wolf of Wall Street irresponsible towards society, because it seems to make heroes out of people who should be considered as villains? These are all points of view, which, while important to talk about, actually are a disservice to the intent of the film altogether. Because, whether we like it or not, the world is very clearly run by all the Belforts out there - the ones who are 'more equal' than the others. Scorsese daringly shows us that even these people are human, and by making an enjoyable film out of Belfort's story, he shows us that if we were in Jordan Belfort's shoes, we would probably have been no different. We're all, in some way or the other, wolves in human clothing.

38,1335,1335,1335,1335,[The] Wolverine,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 5/5.0,/movie/wolverine-review/,,5/5.0,,3.633333333,"Hugh Jackman returns as The Wolverine, and he is one of the key reasons why the film made for a better watch than I expected it to be. Simply by holding back on action sequences and focusing more on character, director James Mangold has made a film that just seems different from the typical films of this genre.","No matter how strong or how fast you get, you just can’t outrun your own inner demons. And Logan has stranger, darker demons, and for far longer to boot, than most other people – if you can classify him under ‘people’, that is. The brooding, sombre mutant is back, and he’s still being haunted by the ghosts of his past.Despite Logan being, by some distance, my personal favourite character from the X-Men series, I must confess that I didn’t have too many expectations from The Wolverine, because there have been far too many X-Men films coming out far too soon, than the world strictly requires. Besides, a few years back, director James Mangold managed to do the impossible by making the first and only Tom Cruise film I dislike, in Knight and Day. I’m unsure, then, if it was my low expectations or the fact that it actually is a film with its own merit, but I quite enjoyed The Wolverine. For one, it has far lesser action than one has come to expect from an X-Men film, or indeed, a film based on any Marvel/DC character or world. The film focuses more on Logan, the character - a mutant whose gravest problems stem from deep within – from his past, his present and his seemingly perpetual future. With the film being set in Japan – mostly in Tokyo, before moving to the outskirts, The Wolverine also has a flavour of Japan that is undoubtedly superficial, but one that works in its favour. Capturing the flavour of a country or city that has its own distinctive culture is largely unexplored territory for a Hollywood film of this genre, and it thus makes for a refreshing change in this film.Indeed, the entire narrative of The Wolverine took me slightly aback with how much it focused on the character and his surroundings, rather on VFX-powered set pieces. The few of the latter that are there in the film are quite well executed as well, without bordering on action-porn, as films tend to do these days. Watch out, particularly, for an imaginative and riveting scene on the top of a thundering ‘Shinkansen’ – what is ubiquitously known as a Bullet train – again, something quite typical of Japan.It helps, of course, to have the towering presence of someone like Hugh Jackman to hold the film together. After Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, Jackman is the only other actor to have a made a comic book character so much his own that it’s hard to imagine anyone else playing it. Also, after watching his incredible turn as Jean Valjean in last year’s Les Misérables, my respect for him as an actor increased tremendously, and his intensity shines through in The Wolverine as well. Every performance around Jackman, though, is so stilted and effected that it jars. The pace of the narrative isn’t breakneck, and yet the film never pauses and lingers around pointlessly either. The runtime of just over two hours thus seems about perfect. To round it off, the film also looks good – despite a bleak, de-saturated colour tone, it makes generous use of solar flares, which always seem to improve the look of even an averagely shot film. The film has a wider 3D release than 2D, so it’s more likely that you’ll end up watching a 3D show. The 3D isn’t particularly great, but it doesn’t hamper the film either. Of course, there is the post-credits scene to look forward to as well, an intriguing little teaser for Bryan Singer’s X-Men: Days of Future Past, which is summer 2014’s big release. So, if you’re absolutely fed up of big franchise films that OD on VFX and action, then you could give The Wolverine a shot – it is a wee bit different from the usual. If nothing else, Logan - and Hugh Jackman - almost adamantly keep things interesting.

39,1336,1336,1336,1336,[The] Woman In Black,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/the-woman-in-black-review/,,3/5.0,,2.966666667,"It’s not a good thing if you spend most of the first half of the film thinking, Harry Potter is the protagonist of the film. Well, Harry Potter in a Victorian suit. Anyhow, The Woman in Black will distract you from its poor choices (casting Danielle Radcliffe primarily) with it’s well formulated horror sequences and thrilling visuals. Brace yourself. ","The Woman in Black, simplistic as the title is, will haunt you for a couple of minutes after you walk out of the theatre. That’s a sign of a successful horror film, some would say. The film reminds you of the 1960s horror films (the production house Hammer Films have quite the success run), with elaborate production design, familiar horror tropes and a plot that one can’t go wrong with, but in spite of spooking you successfully, there are quite a few bones one can pick. However, if horror is what you went in looking for, unadulterated horror is what you will get.Adapted from Susan Hill’s novel of the same name, The Woman in Black is set in the Victorian era where young attorney Arthur Kipps (Danielle Radclife) has to be sent to North England to sell a (haunted) house that is so cut away from the village, it can only be reached by a long marshy causeway that is covered by the sea during high tide. Arthur’s job is to revisit the house for the original occupant’s missing documents.Local legend has it that the house is haunted by a woman who mourns the death of her child, something the villagers did nothing to stop. Arthur realizes this could be the reason for the number of children dying in the village. He goes ahead with his job, despite of multiple warnings from the locals. We are introduced to his financial burden in the beginning, and even though that could be reason enough to go into a haunted house, Radcliffedoes a decent job in selling his curiosity to us, about the house and its story. It’s the idea that he is married man with a kid that doesn’t go down too well. You keep trying to understand, why they would cast Radcliffe for this part – was there a dearth of actors who looked 30 plus? Because Radcliffe most certainly does not. He also has that perennial expression on his face – the same kind that Harry Potter carried in his movies at every moment of looming danger. Minus points for repetitive acting and disbelief there.Having said that, the film’s production design reminds you of homes that genuinely give you the creeps – the kind of haunted houses that needn’t do much, while it’s play with light, shadows, rocking chairs and wound-up toys are enough to creep you out. In that sense The Woman in Black relies on old-school horror tricks, with creaking staircases, random glimpses of half-decomposed ghosts in black, doors shutting tight on their own. We could thank The Woman in Black for reminding us that we can get spooked by the simplest things. A good amount of spine-chilling visuals also add to your entire horror film experience. Cameraperson Tim Maurice-Jones knows what he needs to get the entire picture together – aerial shots of a misty sea in pure grey hues, shadowed forest trees and their play with light and your regular minimalistic piano for background music - and you’re gearing yourself for 95 minutes of periodic covering your eyes and jumping off your seat.

40,1337,1337,1337,1337,[The] World Before Her,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/tore-herhe-world-her-review/,,,,2.966666667,"Nisha Pahuja’s The World Before Her will make you uncomfortable, it will urge you to question what you know and believe, and it will shame you for being a part of a society that doesn’t fundamentally understand that men and women are equal; that such a question being raised itself is a mark of how undeserving humanity is of the world it inhabits.","Who decided that a woman must fight to prove herself worthy of existence? When was it decreed that women are, in any way at all, inferior to men; that their lives mean only to be daughters, wives and mothers? Why is that even today, in a world that has seen humankind create unbelievable miracles – so many of them by women – we still have to ‘reserve’ places for women in government or in other organizations? Why is it that even urban, educated India has different standards for men and women?I must have been all of 5, maybe less, when I first heard the ‘saying’ that behind every successful man there is a woman. It rankled back then, and it still does. We’ve all seen, over the years, how women are the ones blamed for ‘degrading  our culture’, chastised for ‘stepping out of their boundaries’, questioned for possessing ambition, and even physically attacked for ‘embracing Westernization’. If all of this sickens you, then Nisha Pahuja’s documentary, The World Before Her, will hit you in the gut. It hurts like few other films in the recent past.There are two extremes in India – the modern, urban, high-flying but often ugly world of unbridled personal ambition; and the traditional, conservative, fiercely insecure India that guards its past far more than it welcomes the future. The World Before Her juxtaposes the two, with the most objective possible view of the place of women in both worlds. Ruhi is a girl barely out of her teens, from semi-urban India; a girl who aims to make it big at the Miss India pageant. Prachi, on the other hand, is a young instructor at Durga Vahini, the women’s wing of Vishwa Hindu Parishad – the self-appointed custodians of Hinduism (or Hindutva, as they’d prefer to call it.)As we take a look at Ruhi’s journey – which represents that of so many like her – at the unforgiving, relentless training they have to undergo at beauty pageants, you can’t help but feel sorry for the fact that so much of a woman’s self-worth is determined by her external appearance. True, there are pageants for men as well, but they rarely ever claim the spotlight the way a beauty pageant for women does. So strange that a society so unashamedly patriarchal finds a competition that pits women against each other on the basis of their looks far more appealing than one for men.Prachi’s tale, on the other hand, scares you. Here is a girl who is thankful to her parents for letting her live despite being born a girl, because of which she willingly embraces harsh, physical punishments from her father; a girl who derives an almost perverse pleasure because of her power and domination over the young girls, many of them teenagers, who she trains at the Durga Vahini camps. There are times when these camps almost feel like militant training camps; their acceptance and belief in violence as a solution against the enemies of Hinduism – the big monotheistic religions of the world, Western culture and the likes.Most people will find sympathy in at least one of these faces of India. The ones who fall in the middle, those who feel uncomfortable by the questions that can be asked of both these schools of thought, are the ones who will be most affected by the film. Both these worlds, though starkly different from each other, find parallels in each other as well. Diction expert Sabira Merchant, who trains Miss India contestants on the way they speak during the preparation rounds for the pageant, refers to the pageants as ‘factories’, which churn out polished, modern Indian women. The Durga Vahini camps are also like factories, spawning hordes of women who can raise fight if the time calls for it. Both worlds have precise routines, specific methods and a rigid structure that participants just can’t break free of. While Ruhi, Prachi and the other girls we come across in the film are representative of the journeys that women like them follow, they also become characters we invest in. It is hard to miss the moistening of Ruhi’s eyes when she talks about her dream of becoming Miss India and making her parents proud. It is extremely difficult to not view Prachi with a mix of apprehension and sympathy, when she talks about how she hates girls who are too ‘girlish’. And do look closely at Ruhi’s face and the subtle changes you see in it as the film progresses – you’ll see how her Miss India preparation took a biologically-induced toll on her beautifully flawed natural face as well.Interestingly, the documentary is almost crafted like a thriller. It switches between the two worlds smoothly, and as it goes on, you’re almost holding your breath, wondering what happens of the women we meet in the film. You wait to see where their respective journeys lead them; and as the two paths merge into each other, you’re left stunned, but with nagging questions that will haunt you. Almost like how children, when looking at a television, wonder if they’re looking at people in a world inside a box, or if the people inside the box are looking at them and at the world outside.The film restricts itself to the way women are perceived in the two contrasting worlds, but if you think about it, it also questions the two worlds itself. Which is the real India? Is ‘Western culture’ a threat to our own rich heritage? Or is culture a dynamic and evolving construct that has no option but to change as time passes? How is it that a woman can stand before a massive audience comprised of other women, and fiercely speak of how a woman isn’t supposed to think of a ‘career’? On the other hand, in the so-called modern, liberal world of the pageants, the women are taught how to stand, walk, talk and twirl. Their legs are supposed to be a certain way, their chins are supposed to be a certain way. Fingers, toes, wrist, neck - everything has a fixed position to project confidence and personality. Doesn't sound so liberal now, does it?Another terrifying thought you take from the film is just how communally charged a country India is. Day-to-day life might seem peaceful, but that there literally are armies being trained by the majority community in the country is scary. It makes you wonder if the minorities have similar notions and ideas. All of this is simmering below a facade of relative harmony. When it will explode is anybody's guess.The World Before Her is the kind of film that you can write and talk about for longer than you can imagine. Hence, it is also an important film; the discomfort which it engenders being a measure of which face you represent, of the ugly world we live in.

41,1338,1338,1338,1338,World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review1 Reader Review 3/5.0,/movie/world-invasion-battle-los-angeles-review/,,3/5.0,,2.966666667,"The first of the many alien invasion movies to release this year, World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles is a mistake. Aliens are clearly still a soft spot to excite the folks at Columbia Tristar, but this one has got zilch characterisation and no layers in the storyline. Non-stop action, little breathing space for dialogue and all you’re left with, is a film ticket you regret having bought. ","World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles is a painful action movie to sit through. One of those films which makes you despair for worthy newcomers in the industry - great scripts which find no producers - and instead go into mindless special effects bonanzas like this one, all in the name of a science fiction film. Trouble is, the film takes itself seriously and you begin to look for the Exit sign in the theatre.The film is nothing but a 2-hour long action sequence, shot in a manner which Barkha Dutt’s cameraman would have shot the Kargil War: running, ducking from bombs and lasers, with absolutely no aesthetics to photography and no reason for slow motion. Some may argue that it takes the viewer in the centre of the action - and believe me it does, some laser bullets feel like they’re coming through the screen - but why would I want to be amongst a bunch of characters who adhere to the most terrible cliches of American film casting (an Asian, an African, a Latin American, etc) and possess nothing interesting to boast of, not even a sense of humour.The dialogue in the film is mostly incomprehensible - the most common ones being “Move!! Move!! Move!!”, ‘Watch out!!”. I get the feeling that the sound design artist, responsible for creating sounds of gunshots and bomb explosions, must have charged - you guessed it right - a bomb. Action overcomes everything else in this film, which doesn’t even make a lame attempt at explaining logic.Americans are known to be proud of their Armed forces - the Marines - and this film is another attempt at glorifying their role in the middle of any crisis. When the world is suddenly faced with an alien invasion, Captain Nantz (Aaron Eckhart, in a solid performance) and his platoon do everything they can to save a bunch of civilians in Santa Monica, even as major cities across the world attacked by a meteor shower that brings along aliens. Any sense into the whys and hows of the invasion is made clear by edgy news reports - some say it is a colonization, some say they’re here for our water. All this could have been depicted through a new character of a scientist/expert on these things, but director Jonathan Liebesman (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Darkness Falls) and writer Christopher Bertolini (The General’s Daughter) decide to skip all such formalities and focus only on the platoon instead. The result is a film where the characters are just shooting aliens, and some more aliens and some more.Alien invasion films got a new life a couple of years back, when Peter Jackson produced District 9 - it was classy, made globally significant statements about colonization, evacuation and humanity, all in CNN-style again. But it managed to touch a chord somewhere, through more developed characterisation and the docu-drama feel. It was so much more believable. Heck, even the aliens looked better designed. Which means, there’s always a way to make an alien invasion movie interesting. Apocalypse itself is a great theme to draw people into theatres (2012 was a huge success in India and Rolland Emerich continues to make movies on the same theme) - we all want to indulge in that one scary fantasy of how it would feel like to see the world come to an end. Despite being done to death, the success of District 9 showed that aliens still continue to fascinate us, provided there are interesting characters and there’s finesse involved in their making. World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles could have won some brownie points had it tried telling the story through the eyes of the civilians - that way, we’d have got a sense of why Americans love the Marines so much. We don’t know what aliens look like, but why not add some quirks to their character design? This film’s aliens look plain ugly, as do their spaceships and it becomes apparent that not too much time and thought has been spent on them.This special effects film looks good when it begins - the overhead shots of the coastline under attack looks breathtaking, but after a point the novelty of all those explosions wears off and you’re just waiting for the film to end. So I’m at my sarcastic best when I say that it’s a great movie to go for, on a date. The theatres will be empty.

42,1339,1339,1339,1339,World War Z,The keen should rent; else TV/online,wogma review3 Reader Reviews 3/5.0,/movie/world-war-z-review/,,3/5.0,,2.966666667,"Marc Forster's zombiepocalypse World War Z can be fun, if you can overlook the consistent issues in the writing. The film stays watchable because of a continuous stream of scenes that will startle or thrill you, because of Brad Pitt's angsty (if weary) leading man, and because of some decent technical execution.  ","Director Marc Forster has steadily built up a solid little CV that has a number of watchable, if not really interesting, films. Though not quite in the league of some of his better work -Finding Neverland and Monster's Ball, for example - his latest film, the long-in-production zombie-actioner World War Z, surprisingly doesn't exactly do his filmography much harm either. World War Z is what you get when Steven Sodherberg's Contagion mates with Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, with an added dose of serious crack for good measure. An unknown, fast-acting pathogen that affects humans has spawned a deadly horde of zombies that is quickly turning entire cities into vast fields of the undead. Gerry Lane, a retired United Nations field investigator is reluctantly pulled out of a quiet retirement to identify the source of the virus.Despite the clear attempt to lend an air of credibilty to the zombie genre, which has thus far either been made strictly for fans of the genre or coupled with a comic element, World War Z can crumble under serious examination. It abandons coherence in space and time, takes umpteen liberties with its screenplay and has a singularly unmemorable cast, save for Brad Pitt, who himself looks a little haggard and battle-weary, and not strictly because he single-handedly takes on zombie armies either. Also, and there is no denying this, World War Z is the kind of predictable, done-to-death film that Hollywood is no stranger to.Still, if World War Z ends up being watchable enough, it is because of a few genuine thrills that the film manages to pack into its runtime, Ben Seresin's breakneck cinematography that manages to create a perceptible sense of atmosphere despite showing evident disdain towards lucidity in close-combat action scenes, and  some superbly-executed VFX. Also, even a tired-looking, underwhelming Brad Pitt has goods enough to pack a wallop with his effortless screen presence.Also, though this could possibly just be the softie in me, for the first time a zombie film had my heart reach out a little bit for the zombies themselves. In fact, considering how seriously the film takes itself, I personally felt it squandered an opportunity to show how zombie-like our own existences have become. After all, a purpose-less, materialistic life is hardly better than the un-life of a zombie; at least zombies have a purpose - infecting humans. Expectedly, the resolution of the film is as far-fetched as can be. And this is perhaps where Brad Pitt's persona helps the most; you need that kind of presence to overlook how truly incredulous the goings-on actually are. Apart from the last 20 minutes of the film, I really missed the kind of urgency he brought to his character in Babel or the sheer confident cockiness he displayed in Moneyball.The film is out in 2D as well as 3D, and again, the film would be far better experienced in 2D. The 3D darkens an already dark film, and doesn't really add much in terms of the 'third dimension' anyway. World War Z is really just a film for fans of rugged action and saving-the-world films, the kind of film that the audience should not take too seriously, even if the filmmakers themselves have done so.

If it’s the Greek mythology that intrigues you, however, I strongly suggest you rent Troy or even Disney’s Hercules. Basically, give this film a miss. ","I had an option of studying Greek Literature in college, and it all seemed so interesting with evil fathers, Oedipal sons and ostracized siblings – much like the plot of our television shows. I didn’t opt for it finally, but before watching this weeks’ Wrath of the Titans I thought I should read up a bit on Greek Mythology, so my movie watching experience could be devoid of questions. Wrong move. If you’re going to watch Wrath of the Titans (I strongly suggest you spend your money otherwise), please treat this as another action film with the heroes fighting monsters created out of the computer and nothing more. (Think Clash of the titans, John Carter and suchlike) Sequel to 2010’s Clash of the Titans, Wrath of the Titans isn’t an intriguing celebration of Greek mythology laced with universal morals that are passed down for generations. Maybe I was being too wishful to believe so, but I was proven wrong with this watered down version of a mash between Transformers and Immortals. The film begins with demi-god, Persues (Sam Washington) and his humble life as a fisherman. He is visited by Zeus (played by Laim Neeson) who informs him that the gods are losing their Godliness to the Humans and a dangerous war is brewing. Together, Zeus, Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Posiedon (Danny Huston) had overthrown Persues’ evil father Kronos, but now they must strike a deal with him to regain power and remain immortal. While each brother is battling it out to gain autonomy, Persues’, being the hero (and yes, there is no built up to why he was chosen in the first place) must save the human-race. Wrath of the Titans lacks a sense of story and structure. For a sequel, it assumes the viewer has seen the previous film and is well-versed with the small nitty-gritty’s of every character’s history. It’s like expecting to remember your relatives’ middle names and how they are remotely related to you. Before you can clear your doubt, a monster pops up on the screen: between three-headed made-up animals and a puffed up man-buffulo, you’re expecting pretty much anything to pop up on screen as a “threat”. The CG team is the real winner here. There’s no energy in the story-telling. When you revisit an older era, where the culture, habits and look is starkly different, the representation is usually one of awe and passion. Passion to bring out a world that we have only read of in books and more importantly a passion to tell a story based in that world. Wrath of the Titans looked more like a videogame to me – with no enthusiasm in the performances (a waste of the talented Ralph Fiennes), confused sense of structure and an overkill of visual effects. I strongly recommend you miss this one.

They absorb you in how they do it with mind-games and special effects. And this is despite the loud background score and an anti-climatic end. Action film lovers will love it. Those who question the basic concept, can forget enjoying it, of course.","They are creating a world so imaginary, that they can do whatever they want with it. Yet, in the world they create, they stick to some laws, even if they've established those rules themselves. So, here they create mutants, deformed people, but their deformity only makes them more powerful and thus more scary. It's when they break their own rules or deviate from them, that they distract us from what they are trying to do or say. Whether it is the special effects, the moral dilemma, or the mirror they hold to us as a society. X-Men: First Class successfully avoids such digressions and has a gripping story to tell. My issues with the X-men series has mainly been (even X-Men and X-Men 2 and more so in The Last Stand and Wolverine) - this deviation. Mutant-powers being redefined as per convenience. Like say, all mutants suddenly developing an exaggerated sixth sense. The beauty of the concept was that what one mutant can do, the other cannot. It is annoying then, when Wolverine can start hearing/smelling/sensing stuff he cannot see, just because it moves the script along. The other complaint I have had is that the characters were too black and white. That and the lame one-liners - those were the two things that made me really skeptical about a FIFTH film in the series. Fortunately X-Men: First Class consumes you. There's so much going on in terms of mind games and special effects that you have already pardoned the absence of attempts to act. That and it has witty dialogue and some of the pauses are brilliant entertainment. So yes, you fear Shaw, you empathize with Magneto, you feel for Mystique and you wish Prof. X could give his head a rest from his finger. But that's more about the characters and how they've developed over the last decade for you. And has barely anything to do with the performances. Interestingly (assuming that you've seen the earlier films in the series), you know how the main characters in the film are going to end up. But, there's enough going on to make you wonder and wait for ""how"". As usual, the set-up is to display what our mutants are capable of and it is all building up to a humungous showdown. Given the cool things that our newly introduced mutants are capable, I felt a little letdown by the climax. As if some one ran out of $-power. Or rather the money was all consumed by the thumping, loud background music. Even so, it is nice to see Xavier, the sacrosanct, use his power to flirt. It is a welcome surprise to see Magneto's human side or Mystique's feminine one. Their dilemmas are only mutant. But their prejudices are human. The ""bad"" mutants are racists. The ""good"" mutants patronize humans in the evolutionary process, like we in real life want to keep tigers from going extinct.The sides they have to choose between mirror what real life is all about. The communist/capitalist divide or the fight between races or even religions. Yep, there is a token religious symbolism thrown in too. This is the kind of deviation that is unnecessary and makes the film that is going well look over-ambitious and even wannabe. But, the point is this - at the end of 2-odd hours, I came out a satisfied, thriller-action-junky customer. And this is despite wanting a little more in terms of super-power display. X-Men: First Class is just one of those places where the whole adds up to more than a sum of the parts.Warning: Some scenes were obviously censored (I saw it in Pune, India) - either beeped words or scenes cut out.

X-Men: Days of Future Past has a terrific plot, aided by a superb ensemble cast.","There was a time when it seemed like there were just too many X-Men films coming out. After the original trilogy, the fifth film in the franchise, X-Men: First Class, featured an all-new cast, as it narrated the origin stories of Professor X and Magneto. The film, luckily, breathed some life into the franchise.The seventh film now, (two Wolverine films also appeared along the way,) X-Men: Days of Future Past, brings the cast and characters of the original trilogy as well as those from First Class in a terrific way - with a hooking plot that makes you invest in the X-Men like never before.In a dystopian future, the X-Men are being hunted and killed by machines known as Sentinels, for whom the X-Men are simply no match. Professor X and Magneto come up with an ingenious solution to the Sentinal menace.With the horde of Marvel films coming out lately, it is becoming increasing difficult to make each film stand out. The last of them, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, was a fun film, albeit one that still had too basic a plot. In fact, it is in the stories that films can either stand out or pale away; nothing separates them in terms of scale and execution.With original director Bryan Singer coming back at the helm, Days of Future Past has the thrills and bangs alright, but it is really all about the plot. The time travel aspect, the urgency in the characters' actions, the ambiguity in the motives of characters appearing both in the past and the present - all of it keeps you engaged all along. Even though the film seems to borrow so much from so many films in the recent past - for example, there are more than a few Matrix and Inception déjà vu moments sprinkled through the film - the fact remains that set in this X-Men universe with its unique set of characters, it works well. The ensemble cast works even better, because now there are just so many of them. Hugh Jackman has made Wolverine his own, and he's terrific. And there's great joy to be had with the thought of Michael Fassbender and Sir Ian McKellen portraying past and future versions of each other in the same film. Ditto for James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart. Jennifer Lawrence, expectedly in much better shape than in First Class, gets a meaty part and makes it count.One slight disappointment was that there isn't much that stands out in the jaw-dropping set piece department, only because we've seen so much of this already. But do watch out for one incredibly clever scene involving the lightning-fast reflexes of Peter Maximoff (or Quicksilver). With the final tiny post-credits scene, the stage is now set for 2016's X-Men: Apocalypse. Days of Future Past has set the tone for the future nicely.

","X: Past is Past – the name and the fact that 11 directors took a go at one story together – is enough to warn you that it is not going to be your normal Hindi/Indian film. Or if you are me, it is enough to get you excited despite the niggle, “too many cooks...” However, X: Past is Present, pleasantly surprises. The most pleasant one being that it does not get tempted by the many opportunities to go overboard, with the abstract. It stays focused on its protagonist's introspection.Sure, you could think of K (Rajat Kapoor) as a commitment-phobic, escapist. He says so himself. It is rubbed into his face and yours by each of his ex-girlfriends (or should we say X-girlfriends?)  But, it is more about not learning much from the past. This is not about a middle-aged man coming of age, quite literally overnight. He might change after where the film left us, but you wouldn't be surprised if he went through X-XI more relationships that took the same trajectory. After all, if the person falling in love is the same, can who he falls in love with change his perspective, until he really wants to?Until then, relationships will seem to carry a standard pattern. Which is why X: Past is Present feels repetitive and superficial at times. There are other times when it does give some insight, but then the moment/revelation is spoilt by spoon-feeding. Similarly, the camera angles do get a little annoying. At first, it looks like an attempt to be “cool/different”  and then it gets a tad annoying. You feel like saying, “I get it, K is confused and you need handheld camera work to show me his internal turmoil. Got the point, please hold camera steady now.”Even so, the consistency with which K's point of view is presented is something that got me interested in him. Even though I didn't get to know too much about the women, I found myself falling for K. The mystery that he is, the saving that he doesn't know he needs, appeals to the woman in me. And that is where X: Past is Present speaks subtly about how men and women approach relationships. However, that sweeping generalization is not the focal point of the film. K does not represent all men. X: Past Is Present is the story of one man who has gone through many relationships and hasn't figured out what he wants yet. About a man who lets his past relationships come in the way of his present ones. About a man who is looking for closure and maybe has to go all the way back to the beginning to find it – possibly the point where he became K. If the film weren't directed by 11 directors and written by even more people, it would come across as autobiographical. This is as much a compliment to the directors as it is to the editor. Dissecting the film director-wise or story-wise would be grave injustice to how smoothly it has all fallen in place. Jerky editing and back and forth in timeline usually get irritating if done without purpose. Here though, the non-linearity follows K's very human flickering thoughts. The editing adds to the ambience of being in someone's mind. K switches from one thread in memory to another, following his mind's own concept of connect and fluidity. However, when you do piece it together, it might not be a very interesting story. This is where the “how” wins over the “what”. Sensuousness is one of the constant tools through the film. There isn't explicit sex shown on screen, except once. And that once, it is not sexy at all. Yet, there is a palpable sexual tension irrespective of which woman is on screen. The women characters, themselves might almost seem like clones of each other – maybe because the man in question gets attracted to a certain kind of woman. Most of the actresses were very functional and looked uncomfortable in their bits. However, you can always trust Huma Qureshi, Radhika Apte and Swara Bhaskar to sizzle on screen and make even the most ordinary characters stand out. Aditi Chengappa does her bit to create intrigue, but that can be attributed more to the ambiguity of her character rather than her performance. Whether or not any of these were important in the film, X: Past Is Present attempts to underline how the extra X needed in a man's life. Should the focus then have been so much on the physical attraction? Taking the overarching theme of lust as a given, despite a couple of predictable moments, the film keeps you curious, which is not what you can say of many Indian films today. There is a mention of inanimate objects becoming a mode of communication between two people in a relationship. When it came up, I hoped that the theme would be expanded on a little more. The motifs stayed - watches, cigarettes, cups, etc but the theme didn't come back. Oh well, that would make for another film. And this once, maybe the directors can tell the reviewer, “you want a movie like that, you make it!”

","When you walk into a film called ""The Xposé"" and you know the word will stand for both skin-show and a big reveal equally, you aren't really walking in with too many expectations. I actually look forward to a line or two that will entertain/engage or at the very least amuse me. No such luck.Oh wait, Himesh Reshammiya's character Ravi is so obnoxious that it is amusing, till he gets annoying. But, till then, I was in awe of the person who thought of such an arrogant style for the protagonist. So, I am not rooting for the character, who is supposedly mean for the good. I don't care who he falls in love with and what he is willing to do for her. Considering it is a murder mystery, you'd think you are made to care about the victim. But, you are asked, neigh begged, to judge her negatively from the first frame she shows up in. And when the big ""expose"" happens, you don't care either. Sure, the writer has tried hard to make it a huge reveal, but it just doesn't matter enough. In addition, it goes overboard in increasing the tension. Yes, additional drama in terms of slo-mo scenes and dramatic background score. But, also story-wise it goes says more than once, ""not over yet, there's more.""The performances are as perfunctory as they can get. To rub salt into the wound, you have Irrfan Khan doing a voiceover. The setting of the 70s doesn't work at all. The songs, well has either, Yo Yo Honey Singh or Himesh Reshammiya as their singer. So, there's no looking for respite there. The sliver lining is - it is a short film. And that it has come out on a day where people are generally, likely to care about it even less than usual - let alone read its review.

Its ups, downs and in-betweens are handled with care, sensitivity and yet shows the filth that needs to be cleaned up to make this a better place to live in. Despite this it remains a be-as-it-may, this is home and I love it. ","Capitalism vs. communism, Dalit vs. Brahmins, Rich vs. poor, man vs. woman, North vs. South, fatalism vs. cynicism vs. self-believer, good vs. evil vs. not-so-good - and but ofcourse, Hinduism vs Islam vs. secularism. Yeh Mera India deals with all these concepts and more in its 130 minute run and does it fairly too. It employs some twenty odd characters and twines their lives together to make a believable albeit idealist picture of one city in this country. It’s a very enjoyable collage of characters that make up Indian urban life - from the middle-aged woman watching repeats of soap operas, to young career-minded woman aspiring to get away from Indian way of life. The creepy, cheesy bastard to the activist who wants a change in the establishment and soon. Among all the contradictions you see the irony when a doctor becomes the creator of death and when a judge is asked to bribe, or asked to go to court. While presenting this set of more-or-less realistic characters, Ye Mera India (YMI) has in its milieu - education, unemployment, underworld, judiciary, the naxalite movement, impact of jihad training on little minds, the bane of being a good-looking woman, TV TRP's dominating art - a comment on both the industry and the taste of what the audience wants. A setting where a person might not have money but he sure does have a mobile. A city that ain't for the simpletons. A city which supposedly thrives on lack of civic sense - from spitting on public property to lane cutting to road rage. The travel of farm-owner to becoming a suspect for robbery and faces assassination of her character. And in its midst comparing communism to religion. Sure, some of the attitudes on display might be exaggerated - both good and bad. And there's a phase where the sorry gets exasperatingly sorrier. And the usual transitions in characters that are just too good to be true. Then, there's the preacher-teacher going around showing everyone THE right path. While it works at times, it happens too often and unfortunately becomes unintentionally funny. Also the climax is a bit too difficult to digest and takes a lot away from the beauty of the film thus far. And yet it succeeds in making a point. As the mirror is held to various characters, the part of the audience that behaves like the character, sees its image on screen. Also when the intended-to-be-disgusting disgusts, you know all departments have worked completely and in sync. This is accompanies throughout with smart dialogues. And despite the extensive use of abusive language, it adds to the ambience rather and doesn't one look out-of-place. The narrator in the form of a voiceover recites insightful poetry. Though it might be a tad overdone in the first half.  None of this would have worked had it not been for the wonderful choice of cast. And that almost each one of them stood up to their task. And we are reminded that Rajpal Yadav can give a subtle performance if he's allowed to. A pleasant surprise, a decent eye-opener to the subtler hypocrisy in society Yeh Mera India should certainly be on your ""too watch"" list. If not the theaters, at the very least when its out on DVD.

This film makes no effort at subtlety. The drama, humour and action - all revolve around sexuality. None of it however seems forced and just when you begin to wonder what was the point of it all, the twist towards the end of the film save the day with a story around the ‘such is life’ theme.  Winner of Best Original Screenplay at the Venice Festival, this film also won similar nominations at the Golden Globes and Academy Awards. Either watch it alone, or with a cinematically mature bunch of people. Make sure your parents are at bay!","Y Tu Mama Tambien (And Your Mother Too) is a Spanish phrase, often used in response to a cuss word hurled at you. The film will never release in India and even if it does release on DVD, significant portions of the film will get the censors’ axe. (I rented the International edition...geez!). I wouldn’t call it soft porn - it’s in fact one notch higher. That said, I must say, its a good film, with some big names in world cinema attached to it. Directed by Alfonso Cuaron (he made Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and produced Pan’s Labyrinth), this film stars one of my favourite Spanish actors Gael Garcia Bernal (The Motorcycle Diaries, Amores Perros, Babel), along with Maribel Verdu (Milk) and Ana Lopez Mercado (Pan’s Labyrinth).Bernal (Julio) and Verdu (Tenoch) play very close teenage buddies, who at a wedding, court Ana (Luisa) and casually propose a road-trip to a beach, hoping she would bite the bait. When Luisa really does, the trio embark on a journey that makes them discover new shades not only about each other’s pasts, but about life in general.The film’s genre, a road trip, lends itself to easy viewing - thanks to humour, scenic locales, picturesque, agile photography. The purpose of the trip and the key take-away from it, is what takes this film a notch higher. Due credit for that goes to Cuaron’s screenplay. The interplay of the dialogues and the narrator’s voice-over mix very well and provide a longer shelf-life to the characters.I frankly thought there’s too much sex in the film and after a point all that the three are discussing is sex, how they do it, who they did it with and how it was. Sure, there’s a purpose to all those talks and although not all of it is titillating, I’m a huge supporter of subtlety and I’d prefer that a film-maker use semiotics and his own creativity to interpret such sexual energy.  Cuaron’s style is more like, ‘This is how it happened. I don’t want to hide anything’.One of the strong points of the film, is the manner in which Cuaron depicts life outside their car. An accident on the highway, a bride’s family asking for alms, political unrest, regular police patrolling, a beggar entering a restaurant to ask for alms - each of them are beautiful reminders that although the trio may be on a dream road trip, but eventually, they will have to return to the big, bad ugly world. Shades of that ugly world - the character’s histories, some cloaked in lies, appear intermittently throughout the film, resulting in tears, agony and arguments. Each of them are fantastic allegories of bumps on the highway. You slow down for a moment, but eventually you move on.I loved every actor’s performance in the film. Both Bernal and Verdu are intense, jovial and brooding. They’ve done their nude scenes with enormous confidence and their camaraderie shows. Ana is graceful, bold and mysterious and the one force that keeps the three together. Her character, as you learn by the end of the film, is the only thing that saves the film from becoming just a film about a journey.Watch this film with a mature bunch of people - those who appreciate cinema and do not start giggling or gasping at bold love making scenes.

Not in a good way. ,"For a person who watches at least two films a week in the theaters, including some really bad ones, I admit  it is difficult for films to get me hooked. But, hand-in-hand, it is equally difficult to keep me more than 100% detached from what's going on on screen. Even when my expectations are low, I am on the watch for something to like, something to enjoy. But Yaariyan, manages to even take that away from me. The screenplay is all over the place here. The only clarity it seems to have is that it knows not what to do with itself. It is almost like they used a trial and error method of sticking blocks of story together. That is especially sad considering the individual blocks of story are rather random in the first place. Picture this - Four pretty much good-for-nothing kids in college are picked up to defend the honor the college. Why? While you have given up on finding an answer to that, the principal of the college insists on giving reasons which might as well have not been given. So, they have to compete with some college school in Australia and jingoism follows. The competition continues to be pointless and the worst bit is absolutely disgusting sub-plots lengthen the runtime of the film.If I go about looking for a needle in the hay stack, I would say the only Rakul Preet came across as someone who might be a good actor if given a chance. She's sweet and has a fresh spontaneity about her that I'd like to see more of. And I say this with Deepti Naval and Gulshan Grover in the cast. Then you have a couple of songs the lyrics of which strike a chord, but why would you suffer a film for lyrics?Very rarely, do I say this about a film, but this once I have to - there go two and a half hours of my life. Especially considering the Pune International Film Festival is on. Sigh

Over-the-top, no-head-nor-tail, senselessness served in the name of unpretentious cinema. Sure, many from the crowd around me were laughing, hooting, and whistling their hearts out. At what though, is beyond me.No thanks, I'm very comfortable with my sense of humor. ","No one, (yes, including me), walks in to watch Yamla Pagla Deewana expecting an intense experience or a strong story line. Everyone is in there to have a good laugh, come out, and laugh that they laughed. And a scene or two that stick in the head, even after you are out, is a bonus. Even with my expectations being what they should be, I found very few funny or entertaining bits. I'm talking of earthen pots pausing in mid-air in pseudo-Matrix fashion. Only to be lamely put away by Sunny Deol's ""dhai kilo ka haath.""  Creativity, element of surprise is not for this filmmaker. The actors, well, they do whatever Sunny Deol, Bobby Deol and (today's) Dharmendra can do. I was worried I wouldn't be able to hear the dialogue in the middle of all the hooting. But it wasn't a concern at all. The trio is louder beyond that. After all, it is supposedly a prerequisite for the genre. Kulraj Randhwa's role exists so there is some sort of coherence to the planned chaos that the film is. As usual, I was disheartened to see Anupam Kher do a role which demeans his talent.The blatant disregard for the 'writing' department is so obvious that I cannot really complain about how the character establishment of Dharmendra and Bobby Deol as conmen had absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film. And there are many such glaring disconnects. In between this mayhem, it was only a pleasure to listen to a few witty lines strewn across that brought that occasional smile. But that is way too little for a film that is just short of 3 hours.Presenting nonsense is an art form. Watching the entire Deol family dance in one frame is not my idea of entertaining nonsense. Other than that, the action sequences and the stylization - the two other reasons why one would consider watching this film - are as lame as they could be. The interesting thing though is that whether you think the film is going to be - hardcore silly entertainment that you love or brainless torture of the senses - your expectations will be fulfilled.

There is always that element of laughing at, ""so silly that you cannot but laugh"" in films of this type. Fortunately or unfortunately, Yamla Pagla Deewana 2 has that element, but it wanes in about two and a half minutes.

The rest is a mix of inspiring 'quotable quotes' that are worth what they are worth and the typical underdog sports story. Behind all the emphasis on not pressurizing a child to score academically is a thick layer of pressure to succeed in whatever it is chosen for him. And that didn't at all work for me. However, if there is one take away from Yeh Khula Aasman it is the brilliant performance of Raghuvir Yadav.Whether or not I agree with what Raghuvir Yadav's character had to do, his performance is warm and endearing. So is debutant Raj Tondon's performance - he comes across as the perfect representative of the confused, diffident, complex age called adolescence. The rest of the cast is actually functional and thus caricaturish. Only these two seem to have real emotions. In that sense then, real emotion is what the relationship is about. That I found it far from ideal is a different matter. While Ye Khula Aasmaan looks down upon parents tendency to put their children down as a way to bring a sense of responsibility, it adds the burden of bearing a grandparent's aspirations. This then boils down to a child having to live up to someone or the others' expectations. What good will that do? 
So, what if a simple medium of a kite-fight is used signify this larger thing called life. The metaphor is used beautifully in one song, but beyond that it becomes a bit much and all I could see was the need for Avinash (Raj Tondon) to succeed. 
This brings me to the question, what happens to people who don't succeed? There are people who haven't ever succeeded in anything they did. What happens to them? Or it just might be that there is no story worth making a film out of in there. There are indeed very few 'loser' protagonists who have succeeded as a story in a film. 
I won't say which route Yeh Khula Aasmaan takes, that one you'll figure out as the movie progresses. But, what I can tell you is that Yeh Khula Aasmaan is not a complete loss because of Raghuvir Yadav, Raj Tondon and the chemistry they create. The preachy dialogue worked just a bit because it was within a relationship between a grandfather and his grandson. You could see it fall apart as soon as Avinash's friends began saying lines meant to inspire. 
Yeh Khula Aasman has some lovely, warm, genuine moments of camaraderie between  grandparent and grandchild both because of hard work at writing and an heartfelt performances by the protagonists. Unfortunately, it beats its purpose by doing exactly what it pointed a figure at to start with.

It's not just clever dialogue - the overall story, the build-up, and the sequence in which the sub-plots come also have inbuilt humor. I might have enjoyed it better if I knew more about the characters, not in terms of backstory, but anything that made me feel for them - it'd have been nice to connect an emotion to a character.

The camerawork made it a trippy experience. Though I don't understand why so many shots (day shots too) are almost completely dark. Did they take the genre too literally? But since there are so many scenes where the actors can barely be seen, it feels like the lighting decisions are made to hide their lack of skill. What counts though is that the film is enjoyable despite the dark ambience.

It’s a shame that the first hour and the court room scenes are very mediocre. Which is why the twists and turns post-interval come both as a pleasant surprise and make for one of the best climaxes I've seen in a long, long time.","Yeh Faasley's first hour is one of those in which you'd want to walk out of the theater. Like that of a badly made B-grade film. The excessively grainy texture doesn't add any fun either. It is way too distracting. But then, the actual plot starts unfolding and man is it a thrilling ride! It's not just the surprises; the psychological element that the story carries is one mind-bending process. In fact, it is one example of how even a straightforward, linear narrative can take a fair share of your brainpower. After leaving the theater, you go back and forth between why Dev (Anupam Kher) behaved the way he did. It also adds some insight into why Arunima (Tena Desae) who thinks her father killed her mother would still want to bond with her dad. Like anyone in love, she wants to hold on to the last thread of hope, which will keep her from hating her father she once loved. ""Why did he kill her? Is he the man she thinks he is? Was there no love at all between them? Did he kill her at all?"" These are the questions Arunima pulls you into, when you were half-ready to leave the theater. You didn't only because of your respect for Anupam Kher. And while he doesn't let you down, we know he could have done so much more with the scene in which he breaks down. Instead, there is a plain voiceover narrating the emotions. Such a shame. These are decisions for which the director has to take complete blame. Also, the courtroom drama ...actually can't be called drama because it is rather blah considering how smartly and subtly the psychological part of the plot is played out. The screenplay also doesn't support the story in terms of consistent pace. The set-up is boring and takes too much screen-time. The actual action starts much later and has very little time to play itself out. Yeh Faasley's story at its core is beyond awesome. I'd have loved to see what a different director and another screenplay writer would have done with it. Oh well, at least they didn't mess the way it turns out in the end. The psychological nuances and motivations explain everything.Off late, with any movie that I've started to like at any point, I dread the climax - it invariably is butchered by awful writing for the climax or commercial needs. Yeh Faasley is the other way round. The climax is just perfect!

Not nearly as charming or honest as Wake Up Sid, YJHD is the kind of film you wouldn’t mind watching despite the fact that there isn’t much in the film that is memorable. With a cast that will win your heart and music that’ll play on loop in your head for a while after, the film is fun but rarely much more.","*I am out on a vacation. Pradeep has been kind enough to review the film for wogma. So here goes...    ~ meetu* In 2009, a young 26-year old’s debut directorial film won hearts because of how fresh and real it seemed (by ‘commercial film’ standards, of course) especially considering that it came from Dharma, who’ve never truly been associated with anything ‘real’ as far as cinema is concerned. Wake Up Sid has since gone on to become a bit of a cult film; its male lead going on to achieve superstardom not just on the strength of his genes, but also because of some terrific performances that have only gotten better with every passing film.Naturally, expectations from Ayan Mukerji’s sophomore effort, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, were bound to pile up. I, for one, corrected my expectations after the first promo was out. It seemed that Mukerji decided to forsake some of the freshness and realism from Wake Up Sid in favour of a bit more, if I may say it, ‘masala’. That initial bit of correction helped me immensely, because my instinct about the film turned out to be quite close to how the film is.Stuck in limbo between the realism (or as much of it one can spike into a ‘commercial’ film) and the usual larger-than-life-ness one usually associates with Karan Johar (think Student Of The Year), Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (YJHD) is an easy, fun-enough watch for the most, largely due to its continuously vibrant feel, a highly competent lead and supporting cast, and its music, which straddles peppiness and flavor with ease. Episodic in nature, YJHD introduces us to Naina, a young medical student who is in a state of flux because she feels she just doesn’t get to have enough fun. A chance encounter with an old school friend makes Naina cross paths with Kabir Thapar, or Bunny, as he is known by his friends. Despite being poles apart, their attraction to each other has ramifications in both their lives, not to mention the lives of their friends Avi (Aditya Roy Kapur) and Aditi (Kalki Koechlin). What surprised me about the film is how it is as much about friendships and relationships that go beyond romance, as it is about the romance between its (quite enchanting) lead pair. Quite like Wake Up Side which had the flavor of romance but was essentially a coming-of-age film, this film too has romance as one of its pillars, but not the only one. It also is a story of strong bonds of friendship that transcend time and space, about the compromises that one has to make in order to make any relationship work, romantic or otherwise. Not surprisingly, it is also, yet again, a coming-of-age tale, something that seems to be a pet subject for Ayan Mukerji. Expectedly, YJHD falters more than once. Every time the film pauses for a moment of genuine, real insight embellished by some cheesy-but-breezy dialogue (penned by Hussain Dalal), you see a spark of what was seen in Wake Up Side. Soon after, though, the film goes back to farfetched situations that would have seemed more at home in a typical film helmed by, say, Karan Johar. This continuous oscillation between the insightful and the ‘filmy’ takes its toll on the film more than one would have liked. Another area where the film really should have been worked on more was in the treatment of the characters. Despite wearing their chalk-and-cheese character sketches on their sleeves, Naina and Bunny in particular often act or react completely out of character. So, while their overall trajectory is always clear to you, their behaviour and traits will often make you wonder why exactly they are like that, when they are actually not supposed to be like that.Despite some rather serious issues in the writing, then, what really makes the film race to the finish line are the performances. Starting from Farookh Sheikh and Tanvi Azmi who barely have a couple of scenes, all the way up to Ranbir Kapoor who expectedly dominates proceedings in terms of screen time, every single actor is worth their weight in gold, as far as this particular film is concerned. The surprise packages are Kalki Koechlin, Aditya Roy Kapur and Deepika Padukone, who infuse such genuine charm, likeability, believability and credibility into their characters that you can’t help but really love them. Ranbir’s performance needs to be considered in context. After two diametrically opposite yet equally intense performances, one could be fooled into thinking that Ranbir could easily ace this character and that he deserves more challenging roles. Yes, YJHD doesn’t challenge him like some of his earlier films, but that doesn’t mean that he doesn’t invest his all into it. Here is someone who gives every character everything he has, and Ranbir gives Bunny the life that he deserves. Also, one can’t but help notice the terrific chemistry of the Ranbir – Deepika pair. They look like they are meant to be together on screen, and the optimist in me believes that they have the potential to become the SRK – Kajol of their generation.Despite some highly contrived song situations, the music of the film, by Pritam, holds its own. Every song is a bit of an audio-visual treat; even the one with Madhuri Dixit in it, despite the terribly underwhelming situation it arrives in. Overall, the songs do play a major role in keeping things going. Badtameez Dil and Balam Pichkari are terrific because of Ranbir and Deepika respectively, while Kabira and Ilahi add soul and texture to the soundtrack.With a run time of 2 hours and 45 minutes and the fact that the film doesn’t really have anything new to say, the film isn’t likely to be universally loved. Still, it is the kind of film you wouldn’t attempt to find too much fault with, because of how it stays clear of getting annoying or overly predictable, even if you largely know which direction you are being led to. Not a particularly bad way to spend a few hours of your life, though I’d take Wake Up Sid over YJHD any day of the week, and twice on a Friday.

Youngistaan claims to represent the youth and I shudder at the thought of the youth - you and I - being so shallow and superficial in our approach to problems at the national level. What do I want from my representative in the government? Only my lookout? Only whether my point of view has been represented? I don't think so. I want what is generally good for the society as a whole. But, Youngistaan has created a Prime Minister who thinks his way is the way to go. I consider myself pretty liberal so, I don't really care about my Prime Minister's girlfriend problems or daddy issues. Everyone has them, he is human, he is allowed to have them too. Am I okay with him having a live-in relationship? Now, my liberalism is being put to test. I am okay with friends, but a role model. Hey, wait! In a film about the future of the country, why am I even asking this question? Fine, Youngistaan doesn't talk about just this issue. From the huge ocean of politics the two and a quarter topics they pick are change in calculation of rate of interest on loans for a particular range of people, a scam of some sort, and a quarter of a nod at farmer suicides. The accountant in me couldn't resist laughing at the implications of the interest rate change that our PM Abhimanyu Kaul (Jackky Bhagnani). The build up of the scam led to something so standard (I know, it's sad that there is something like a standard scam) that you wonder what the big issue was. The look of surprise when it is mentioned to our PM that agriculture is our main sector, is actually insulting. His superficial solution, makes you feel worse. Then you consider for a moment if Youngistaan is a story of a 28 year old boy who is emotionally blackmailed into becoming the prime minister of the country. But it doesn't work that way either. It loses that battle at its name itself, right? It wants to represent the youth. It is not an individual's story yet it spends too much time on the love life of that individual while trying to deal with national crises via some jingoism, of course. A storyline with such a premise would be a difficult sell even with the best actors at your disposal. Jackky Bhagnani does come across as sincere. But there is so little time spent on writing a character that is so important, that like I said, I doubt any other actor could've helped. Same goes for Neha Sharma who's supposedly the supportive girlfriend. Again, such a wonderful chance of writing a layered character wasted. A similar waste of talent is Farouque Shaikh. May his soul rest in peace.Sure, there is an attempt at trying something new. It feel flat on its face, but at least they tried. Oh well.

But then all this while the eyes were witnessing a Sanjay Leela Bhansali set-up. So, a Hindi film enthusiast should be all set to get dazed and dazzled. The advantage to this though is that in contrast the story and characters are as simple as can be.You know what simple means, right? Black and white. And eventually black turns white. Sure there are a couple characters like the lawyer (Mithun Chakravorty) and the maternal uncle (Anjan Srivastav) that make you wonder if they are black or white for a bit. But then you lose interest. The writers clearly want me to take sides, but don't give me enough details to be bothered.Neither can I be made to really care about the main characters. 2 out of the 4 (Salman Khan and Zayed Khan) are losers - and sore ones at that. One is eye candy trying out her emoting skills - that would obviously be Katrina Kaif. That lady is certainly at her elegant best, though.  And the only one who was worth watching, for his supposedly autistic behavior, Anil Kapoor has very little screen time.Now, a simple wiki search tells you that autism is ""is characterized by impaired social interaction and communication"". But our man is social enough to lecture his beloved uncle on family values. And he has befriended children and adults who have bothered to interact with him. Not to mention he has grown appropriately in his flirting capabilities. Ok, we shall not hold story-writers responsible for the big words they off-handishly throw our way. Please, can we have them write a decent, engrossing story? The Archie-Veronica angle and her rich dad spouting exaggerated insults at him is yawnnnn. It's a musical extravaganza madam, you expect the wrong things all the time.Now that is one thing Yuvvraaj cannot be accused of - lacking in the song and dance department. I actually enjoyed listening to the songs, barring ""aaja main hawaon mein"". And for being distracted during that one, I can actually blame the phobia I have for animated petals after Drona. The way the other songs were picturised did have a broadway musical feel to them,  and this was ratified by an all out replication of the makeup from the CATS musical. BUT, stick to that. Please don't have Salman Khan talk to Beethoven. Anyway, we could have done with a lot less of familial blah-blah. That would also help in reducing the length that is stretched to almost 3 hours.

Are they so smug to not realise that a two-expression Ram Charan taking the place of Amitabh Bachchan is many huge steps behind to start of with? Are they so blind to not see the disservice to films from the 70s by having a over-bearingly peppy, supposedly dumb Mala (Priyanka Chopra) replace a simple and sensitive Mala (Jaya Bachchan)? The original had this nice combination of angst and sensitivity between Vijay and Mala. It wasn't explored too well there too, but here it is completely ignored. This takes away a huge chunk of the meat that the plot had. I guess the only positive contribution by this Zanjeer is that the woman gets invited to the birthday party! You see, Mala was left out of Sher Khan's birthday party in 1973. Come 2013, she gets to look pretty in white and shake a leg too!Priyanka Chopra, like I mentioned earlier, plays a very perky Mala. We can't really fault her if the script used her like comic relief. That besides, Ram Charan tries too hard to look intense and Sanjay Dutt looks like he was forced to play Sher Khan. There is a slur in his movements in the fight scenes and in his speech when he speaks. A couple of other things make things even worse - the dialogue and the music. You don't know what is worse - the iconic original lines that are retained or the new lame lines. A few more moments of disbelief - how could they not know that 'jab tak baithne ki ijaazat...' by anyone but Amitabh Bachchan or 'Sher Khan beimaani ka kaam bhi...' by anyone but Pran is epic fail? The songs are more or less annoying. My take on item number is no secret. Not only are they aesthetically displeasing and condescending to me as an audience, but the manner in which they break the flow of the story is the most irritating bit of them all. Here you have two songs that can fit that bill. Zanjeer also has a ridiculous background score. At first when, 'raghupati raghav...' played during a fight sequence, I wondered if the projectionist goofed up and turned on Satyagraha's soundtrack. Unfortunately, not. And the background track repeated almost every time Vijay has a fight sequence. Oh well...I understand that even if you had nothing better to do, you'd be better off watching the Zanjeer from 1973, this one cannot be completely written off - maybe just because I have seen worse, and await much worse.

61,1358,1358,1358,1358,Zapatlela 2,Add to 'must watch' list,wogma review,/movie/zapatlela-3d-review/,,,,1.6,"Mahesh Kothare returns with Zapatlela 2 in 3D, proudly wearing the tag of being the first Marathi film in 3D. If you enjoyed the original film, then you might just have fun with this sequel. The terrifying Tatya Vinchu is still fun, and even though Lakshya is absent this time round, Adinath Kothare fills his boots surprisingly well. If silly, scary dolls are your thing, submit yourself to Tatya’s menace!","So that’s how it feels. A screen playing a Marathi film packed to capacity, an audience hooting and cheering in the first show on the day of release. Twenty years after Tatya Vinchu terrified Lakshya (and the audience) with the sheer audacity of his existence, he’s back, this time with the third dimension in tow. Despite being an unabashed fan of the original film, I reminded myself that I was only about 8 when I watched it first. I walked in to the theatre this time, with my palm at the ready, not too far from my face. Yes, I must confess, I was expecting to ‘facepalm’.For the uninitiated, twenty years back, dreaded gangster Tatya Vinchu, in his quest for immortality, transferred his soul into a doll in his dying moments with the help of a spell taught to him by Baba Chamatkar. The doll, owned by ventriloquist Lakshmikant alias Lakshya, wreaks havoc before it is ultimately shot down by Inspector Mahesh Jadhav. Sounds ridiculous? Well, if you had watched the film when it came out, you’d know just how much fun the film was, despite the corn-and-cheese.Surprisingly, despite predictable buffoonery, continuous madcap comic horror (if there is such a thing) and the absence of the late Lakshmikant Berde – one half of the soul of the earlier film (pun unintended) - Zapatlela 2 makes for a fun children’s film, especially if the audience were children when the original film came out. Yes, it is a silly film that rarely pretends to be anything but. However, sometimes, just sometimes, the hackneyed phrase, ‘leave your brains at home’, genuinely comes in handy.My palm and my face, then, rarely met during the film, and when they did, it was out of some genuine indulgent fun. This time round, Tatya Vinchu is hunting for Lakshmikant’s son Aditya, who has grown up to become a mechanical engineer, but in his heart of hearts wants to be a ventriloquist like his father. Aditya, of course, is blissfully unaware of the events of twenty years ago. Really, I cannot emphasize how much your reaction to this film depends on whether you were a fan of the original film or not. That ragtag doll voiced by the legendary Dilip Prabhavalkar took on a personality of its own, engraving itself in memory. The doll looks freakishly the same, and that moronic expression on its face still has the ability to strike comedy-tinged terror in your heart.Zapatlela 2 works to an extent, in spite of having virtually no plot and a number of pointless subplots revolving around the ventriloquist, his guard, a lady journalist and a romantic track involving Aditya; it works because of its relentless physical comedy. Also, Adinath Kothare, son of director Mahesh Kothare, does a fine job as Aditya. Mahesh Kothare himself reprises his role as Mahesh Jadhav, now Commissioner, and he does it well. Again, the cherry-on-top is the menacing return of the doll, voiced by Dilip Prabhavalkar. He’s still angry and bloodthirsty, and he’s still capable of taking on full-grown men with ease. The doll animation is marginally better this time, but even if it wasn’t, that would be the least of your concerns with this film. Also, I was quite surprised to notice that the makers haven’t compromised on technique here. The film is fairly well-executed, in the manner in which it is shot and cut.  And if you’re going to enjoy ludicrousness, then you may as well enjoy the shameless exploitation of the third dimension. Objects are thrust and thrown at you with alarming frequency, and I could hear children in the cinema hall particularly enjoying the experience. Let’s be clear; Zapatlela 2 is for fanboys and fangirls, and for their children, who are bound to have a good time. Take them along for a ride that Tatya Vinchu won’t let them forget. If you don’t fall in that category, then you’ve always got a palm and a face.

62,1359,1359,1359,1359,Zero Dark Thirty,"Beg or borrow, but do watch",wogma review,/movie/zero-dark-thirty-review/,,,,1.6,"Kathryn Bigelow is back post ‘The Hurt Locker’, and there couldn’t have been a better follow-up to that cult hit than Zero Dark Thirty. A dramatized account of the hunt for Osama Bin Laden, the film is immensely engaging without being unnecessarily dramatic, and more importantly, without ever transcending into jingoistic Americanism. Zero Dark Thirty is, quite simply, a thrilling and moving film.","It has been a while since I watched a film that I hoped would never end. Kathryn Bigelow’s Zero Dark Thirty, for me, was precisely that. A gripping cinematic adaptation of the long-drawn hunt for Osama Bin Laden in the wake of 9/11, I was amazed at how every second of the film held a sense of drama, even though the treatment of the film was far from dramatic.  Like most films based on real events, particularly those that are so fresh in memory, Zero Dark Thirty is the kind of film that almost anyone can paraphrase in a few sentences, knowing pretty much how the story proceeds, and definitely knowing how it ends, even if they haven’t watched the film. Yet, the film is so much more than just the story of how Bin Laden was found. For me, Zero Dark Thirty was partly a dramatization of a real life manhunt, partly a spy-thriller and mostly the intensely personal (and fictional) story of one persevering woman who makes it her life’s mission to find and kill the man who spearheaded the death of over 3000 of her countrymen.The film follows Maya, a CIA agent recruited straight from college and eventually stationed in Islamabad; she has done nothing at CIA but look for Osama Bin Laden. From an awkward, mute spectator of the torture of captured terrorists orchestrated by her colleague to a ruthless executor of those very same torture techniques (though never losing her conscience or her discomfort with them), Maya obstinately tries every trick in the book, and some outside it, in an attempt to smoke out America’s most wanted terrorist. Embellished with Alexandre Desplat’s minimalist but haunting background score, the film is technically top-notch. So much so that you’ll forgive some of the goofs; for example, the glimpse of the India Post signboard in a scene supposedly set in Pakistan (parts of the film were shot in Chandigarh). The camera that captures the action in Zero Dark Thirty is almost like another character in the film. It is always on the move, as nervous and fidgety as the characters themselves, almost as if it is as frustrated at the slow progress on tracking Bin Laden’s whereabouts as the head honchos at the CIA. And if the camera is a character, then the soul of that character is undoubtedly the editing of the film. Splicing together chapters of ‘the world’s largest manhunt’ across over a decade, across countries, hierarchies and departments while never losing that personal touch - the fact that it is humans hunting humans - the film has been creatively and technically edited to near-perfection. The final 20 minutes of the film are the icing on the cake. Post its US release, the film underwent its share of controversy. There is no doubt that the film’s much-talked about torture scenes are gruesome (but never disgusting or unwatchable). But to say that the film either glorifies torture or distorts the truth behind the extent of the torture is unfathomably ignorant. Maya’s reactions to the torture scenes and the manner in which she reacts even during and after she conducts some torture herself, quite amply illustrate the stand that Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal have taken, even though their approach to the film is remarkably close to neutral. For the second time in under a week, I watched Jessica Chastain anchor a film by achieving a remarkable graph in character that makes the viewer feel a personal stake in the character’s story. That being said, her performance in Zero Dark Thirty is miles ahead of her performance in Mama. It is hard to imagine anyone else recreate the character of a frail, petite woman with nerves that can make most men nervous; she does it with various male characters in the film and you will never have trouble believing it.Joel Edgerton wasn’t required for the role he plays, that of the leader of the SEAL team on Operation Neptune Spear. Having said that, the calming, reassuring effect of his sheer presence is hard to deny. A number of other supporting characters leave their mark; Jason Clarke as the man who initiates Maya into the interrogation process is excellent, as is Kyle Chandler, who plays the Islamabad station chief and Maya’s boss. The film is never infused with any additional drama; the actual unfolding of the events does that by itself. As I mentioned earlier, so riveting is the narrative that I never wanted the film to end. At nearly two and three quarters of an hour, I didn’t find the film too long at all, though I suspect there will be those that will. Still, whether you are interested in the procedural aspect of the hunt for Bin Laden or the dramatized portrayal of it, Zero Dark Thirty is a film that must be watched.

But it's too long and long-windedly preachy to hold interest through the end.,"Bhagyashree carries over from Maine Pyaar Kiya to show what post-marital life would be with a simple and virtuous woman like her. Simple she may be but succumbing her character, Asmita is not. She knows her mind and will not compromise or take any crap thrown her way. Asmita, however impractical is the only beauty of this film. The rest is a lot of ho-hum and a very poor attempt at comedy. I have often wondered why a person offends in public and apologizes, if at all, in private. The basic plot of this film makes sure that the wrong-doer is appropriately humiliated in public. And that if the offended is strong in conviction they will get their way. Yet, it takes an exasperatingly long time to get there it also has loads of eye-roll inducing dialogues served along the way. Surprisingly though, there's a certain flow in the script that is lacking in many Hindi and Marathi films these days. It doesn't come across as one episode was edited to be pasted after another randomly. One event led smoothly into another. That still doesn't mean that characters are consistent or transform smoothly or are written well. And the interactions between people seem extremely superficial. There's this constant feeling of being in the late 80s-early 90s. From the way the people are dressed to their body language to the way the songs are picturised. That also means that Bhagyashree looks absolutely sweet and the other side characters absolutely obnoxious. I can't deny that it's very adorable to see a bride actually feel shy on her wedding day. If nothing else it's nostalgic for sure. But, we'd much rather watch one of the films for 90s for that, wouldn't we? Also, some out of all the really long songs are absolutely hideous. And song or no song, there's absolutely nothing natural about any of the performances - as 'put-on' as they can get. If you have the patience to sit through or forward some long speeches on values, some distasteful songs, some yawn-worthy comedy there is a pretty impractical yet novel argument in the end. But that patience will be required in abundance.

Mostly silly, sometimes endearing but always pointless, it is the kind of film that will make you smile by the sheer sincerity in its stupidity. Give me Zhakaas over  Players any day.","Ankush Choudhary is clearly a man in love with himself. In addition to being the lead actor of Zhakaas, he has also directed the film. So he gets to walk multiple times in slow motion towards the camera (Ray Bans in tow), leap to super human heights and stay there long enough to wink at the audience, and in general make himself feel slightly more important than he actually is. Last seen in the disastrous Pratibimb, he has the aura of someone that you really cannot take too seriously.Perhaps that has helped Zhakaas in some measure, because inane as it is, I still came away feeling mildly amused. The prime reason for this is the fact that the film really doesn’t take itself too seriously. It promises entertainment and if the reaction of my co-audience in the theatre is anything to go by, it manages to deliver that in some measure.The plot itself is as ludicrous as can be. Right in the initial reels, it is revealed that Ankush’s character leads a triple life, with three different girls. A series of gags then go on to explain the Five Ws and One H of this situation. Needless to say, logic and anything that might appear close to it in a thesaurus take a backseat in this flick. The performances in this film add some measure of school-boyish charm to the ridiculous goings-on. Ankush himself is surprisingly endearing, because he invests himself completely into his part, or should I say, parts. Of the three girls, Sai Tamhankar as the spunky photographer Neha succeeds in sprinkling some believability into her part. She manages to emote well for the most, with the occasional tendency to go over the top. But then, in this film, who doesn’t? Pooja Sawant as the innocent head of an ad agency is pleasant. Amruta Khanvilkar looks marvelous as the Kolhapuri bombshell, but is completely miscast vis-à-vis her performance. The guys who come across as the true winners though, are Jeetendra Joshi, Pushkar Shrotri and Vikas Samudre as the three lovers who are denied their lady loves by the cool stud (?)Ankush. Each of their characters has unique quirks that seem pointless, but add a flavour to the comedy. They are involved in a series of madcap jokes and set-pieces that are delivered so convincingly by them, that you are willing to forgive their downright stupidity.Technically, the film has nothing to boast of. Colourful in its feel, it still leaves a lot to be desired in terms of production value. Also, though this might be a problem with the projection at the theatre where I watched this, it seemed that the framing at times was simply careless, with characters’ heads getting cut off for no apparent reason. The music of the film is purely functional. The fact that a couple of the songs have Hindi lyrics, however, is truly disappointing. It is hard to see a point in making a Marathi film that has Hindi songs. Ultimately, what manages to ensure that this film isn’t a complete waste is the fact that, quite like Priyadarshan’s Malayalam films of yore, a number of the jokes are such that they wouldn’t have been that funny in any other language. For that reason alone, I afforded a smile once the film was done.

This is a gutsy view of the current behind-the-scene in Maharashtra. Strong dialogue, serious material and yet not preachy - we are exposed to a part of what makes this world filthy - good ol' dirty politics. ","A line in one of the songs translates to - 
There's no foreigner to burn you,
Nor a Gandhi to put out the fire
-   Implying of course, that there's a fire for sure. You have created it, you need to put it out. There's no enemy and no savior other than you.
Zhenda tells you what this fire is, in current-day Maharashtra. The political situation created by the power-controllers in the system, and the resultant change in social dynamics of the common man, including the party-workers. And it does so pretty efficiently and effectively.Some powerful, smart dialogues, some realistic performances, and a story that could be as real as possible - Zhenda is an intriguing affair right from the beginning. The first few minutes create curiosity about the complex political mesh prevailing in the state. And then you are introduced to nitty-gritty using a few representative examples - a couple of party-workers, an aspiring politician, their friends, family, and other supporters. It then comes down to two specific party-workers who are greatest of friends and as situation demands fall into different factions of political party. Each thinks he supports an ideology. But both are victims to blind faith and misguided loyalty. Though it's pretty much predictable that a film making a political comment will have character arcs that can go only a certain way, but it is interesting to see each one develop. The transition of each character is marked by the function of power he controls and the priority in his life. A non-believer in politics, an ace marketing guy, gains power and his priority changes from aspiring to move to the US to something completely unthought-of for him. A completely brainwashed political party-worker realizes his worth in the political system through his negative experiences and takes control of matters. The role of family and personal career growth is somehow inversely proportionate to the power you can exude. There are a few things that leave question marks. Is it so easy for a party-worker to go off on his own? And you try to convince yourself. Maybe - considering they aren't that valued in the first place. 
But that's the film. The bravery needed to make such statements and have a story and characters so similar to real life figures is a remarkable deed in itself. To take it a step further, and take on, arguably, a political family most ""popular"" for taking on to violence to prove a point - the Thakareys - could be considered martyrdom, by some. But, Avdhoot Gupte does it and does it well, without flinching. I am tempted to call it a documentary. A visual documentation of the situation created by our ""leaders"" in the state we live in, in the last few years. We, the ones who are not politically involved, at least not enough to join a party, are bystanders and get a peek into the lives of those who believe in their leaders with eyes closed. It is targeted towards these people and poses a question on their behalf -
Vithhalla, konta dharu me zhenda?
O Lord, which flag should I hold up (support, fight for)?

Zid doesn't even try. Sure, there are new things happening, but the suspects remain the same, the new events reinforce the suspicion on all the suspects equally. Interestingly enough, the reason you suspect people other than the story is trying to point a finger at vehemently, is because the film is so strongly doing so. By doing these things in combination and with a 2+ hour run-time, Zid doesn't keep your attention and you lose interest altogether by the end. Sure, the final twist is a good one, especially with what it implies about what you've been seeing so far. But unfortunately, it comes a little to late. Another thing that got to me was the spooky, horror-style treatment given to the film. We are not talking about haunted houses or unhappy, troubled spirits. So, I didn't quite understand why have an environment that makes you look out for a ghost through the film. Such horror films are known to be associated with some amount of sexual content too. Zid doesn't disappoint on the quantity it has on offer. The quality though is completely missing in terms of chemistry between the two involved. While you could fault the actors for that bit, it's not that they can't act at all. You see some hope in Karanvir Sharma because he shows great restraint when there was every scope to go over the board. While Mannara compensates for that bit by over-doing the crazy bit, every once in a while, she shows a slight change of expression which tells you she can do a good act if that's what she was directed to do. Shraddha Das on the other hand, holds just one expression - with the typical, sex-horror film glaze in her eye that every other lady in a film of this genre carries. That aside, the writing just doesn't engage you like a thriller should. It tries the known hooks that horror movies usually opt for when they know they can't keep you involved - cleavage and sex. Tells you how confident the makers were in the story they had to tell, which incidentally they try to boast about - their narrative capabilities. Unfortunately, it shows a lack thereof.

Best you keep away from them. To do that stay away from the film, please.","Zila Ghaziabad is a revenge drama that never should've been made. Just like Jayantabhai Ki Luv Story was a romance that never should've been made. Without an ounce of originality Zila Ghaziabad just seems like someone's fetish of watching two hours worth of action. Amidst this free-for-all shootout, it was hilarious then to see a bone being picked because a few of the goons wore fake police uniforms while shooting. Huh? That was the only objection that the keepers of law and order had? Other than that, there are maybe four or atmost five one-liners that might bring smiles, two of which would be innuendos. Almost every frame reeks of drama. And drama almost always means either loud background score or slow motion that goes on for a little more than would be needed to make the drama effective. But hey, what can you say, for this is a world where slo-mo defines the character who is  in focus - If he's being recorded in slo-mo means he is important, means along with other characters in the film, we should fear him.That is as deep as the writing goes. The three male leads could take each others' place or character and you wouldn't know. The women, calling them props would mean they had some significance in the film. Unless their role as being the one who is shot/kidnapped to get at another man, implies they have meaning in the life of the men or the film. With such a background then, do the men need to emote at all. And even if they try would it come across as anything but fake. Even so, you can see Paresh Rawal, Arshad Warsi and Ravi Kisen at least try. Sanjay Dutt and Vivek Oberoi on the other hand try to hard. The only interesting character then seems to be Fakeera (Sunil Grover) who plays Shakuni Mama in this supposed replay of Mahabharat. Just in case you miss the Mahabharat analogy you have a loud 'yada yada hi dharmasya' playing when Pritam Singh (Sajay Dutt) is in action. It's a different matter that any two sides waging war against each other with a cunning character could mean its trying to depict Mahabharat. So, to give that one a break you have Sanjay Dutt staring at a chess board and after much contemplation moving a pawn on the board as a first move! It doesn't end here, later you have two kings facing each other, two steps away from each other. Item numbers - two not one, cheesy one-liners, self-referencing jokes that's what makes up for the parts of  Zila Ghaziabad that aren't action. The action sequences itself are tedious almost in competition with the tiring drama.

68,1365,1365,1365,1365,Zindaggi Rocks,Watch if you have nothing better to do,wogma review6 Critic Reviews 0.8/5.0,/movie/zindaggi-rocks-review/,0.8/5.0,,,3.95,,"Take away Sushmita and the rating falls to the last slot…that’s how much the movie is about Sushmita and her much-publicized rock star character, Kria. Sushmita’s acting evokes emotion - the audience smiles when she is happy and tears swell up when she is sad. It sometimes feels like you are seeing a slice from her real life. She looks gorgeous too - not breathtaking-gorgeous, but wow-she-is-so-sweet-gorgeous. She has designed her own outfits and they are dazzling. A Sushmita fan might not want to miss this one.  
For the rest, though, there is nothing much in there. Yes, Shiney Ahuja plays the doctor well, but since the story is all about the rock star, he can do only so much. He has some really insightful lines, especially when he is in the narrator mode. The other character artistes are just too loud and exaggerated. Most of them are have unnatural characters. Moushmi Chatterjee needs to do something about her diction. 
One of the best things in the movie comes towards the end. It is the symbolism between a poem that Kria is writing and the situation she faces, this is played out very artistically. 
The screenplay is very stretched out. There are many scenes, where the audience has enough time to think and say, “Okay, got the point, next please!”
The story is different and good, but the end is so prolonged that we realize what the climax is going to be an hour before the movie finishes. The suspense therefore is effectively ruined! Then, you just sit there waiting for it to happen. 
Of course, no opportunity is lost to put in a song. And why not? They have the perfect excuse! The atypical music is very easily overshadowed by the lyrics. To the eye though the songs are not much of a treat. The song that introduces Sushmita starts off as her performing on a stage and then becomes more like a video album giving it a very artificial look. Was somebody trying to save money by not doing a crowded, rock-show scene right through the song? And what’s with supposedly sensuous songs amongst unusually long white curtains? 
Not all the technical nuances are handled well. While most of the medical information given out sounds close to reality. But then, when there is a person dying, isn’t a doctor’s first reaction to take him/her to the hospital?!? There are flaws on the rock star side too. Like, can a rock star break into song wherever she pleases, isn’t she bound by contracts?

We are a generation that can afford to live life moment-by-moment. So, why aren't we. Go watch the film, before all the people who've loved it get you so excited about it that you are left disappointed. ","I loved Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. I don't know if it will last long enough to become classic or cult (never understood those terms). But, I enjoyed every single moment that I spent in that theater. Yes, even though it was a full two-and-a-half-hour-long film. Three friends are off to Spain to close on a deal they made with each other years ago - each will choose an adventure that the three of them have to experience together. The characters are alive, the cast is lively, the writer is thoughtful and the movie is clean, soft, perceptive entertainment.There is nothing profound about Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara; neither does it bring any insight that you and I don't already have from our own relationships. But, it connects from the word go. Maybe, I connected with it instantly because some of the things are too close to home. I've spent a lovely week-long, road-trip in Spain. I've walked through the little towns on their narrow, stone-bricked lanes. I've lived in the quaint hotels with their lovely lobbies.  And the cinematographer brings all of this alive. Spain, what a beauty you are! Add to this nostalgic mood, a piece of adventure that the three friends are experiencing. Deep sea diving, my latest addition to the ""I love"" list. And sky-diving which I've wanted to do (with my mom, no less!) for the last 15 years. The third adventure, uh...well...that one I think I'll play the woman card and leave it at, ""I'm happy to enjoy it vicariously through Abhay Deol, Farhan Akhtar and Hrithik Roshan.""Also fast getting on the list of ""I love"" are these three men! And goodness, even Katrina Kaif. Abhay Deol is instantly endearing as the sorted-out, problem-free, likeable guy who runs a little above average on emotion for a man. Farhan Akhtar's Imran is aptly described as an a$$hole. He plays the perfect shallow-outside-deep-inside, observant poet who doubles up as the comic relief. If I had to pick a weak-link it'd be Hrithik Roshan, but I'd be nit-picking about how his acting falls flat in the second half. He, after all, did get me annoyed with his ""oblivious to my arrogance"" attitude. Usually, introductions bore me; they are too in the face. And climaxes, disappoint me. The better the build-up towards it, the worse the fall in the end. Very few films manage the climax that is Goldilock's ""just right"". Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara's set-up is so subtle, that you don't even realize that's what it is till the opening credits begin. And the climax is yep, ""just right""! A minute more after that would have been too much. Yeah-yeah-yeah, there I do have my mandatory reviewer's disclaimer ""There are couple of flawed moments."" But you know what, they pass by quickly, and the fun/sweet moments are many more.Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara like zindagi itself, is about mistakes. It's about closure and the importance of closures. Because only then can we move on. Only then, can we have that new beginnings, we so deserve. ""Life is a once-only gift. Live it to the fullest.""  The cliché was alien to our parents. And is becoming the mantra of our responsibility-free generation. And why not? New money is becoming easier to get and even easier to spend. Savings is a dated concept. Because who knows? You might live long enough to enjoy retirement. Reminder: We live in a world of tsunamis and bomb blasts. So, there is merit to ""live the moment""So, when are you planning your next vacation? Fine, fine, take your time. Meanwhile, book your tickets before the praise that I've just showered upon the film raises your expectations so high, that they will only fall.

And yet, there is enough for the under-10s to enjoy indoors on a hot summer day. ","The set-up is as Harry Pottery as it could get. Orphaned child is used as a house servant by close relatives. He has two friends who make life livable for him. The plot deviates from here into bizarre situations. And somewhere in the strange world created, science is given all the credit. But, in the eyes of a 10-year old, it must all be fun. So, it'd be all right for kids to watch it when it comes around on TV.My issue with most of our stories is the lack of attention to detail. So our superhero 'zokkomon' doesn't have any superpowers, all he has is stuff enable by science. How then does he emit pretty lights around him? Maybe I'm just too scientifically challenged. But, it's all good because kids will oversee such stuff. They'll just be awed by the cool things this boy their age can do. That's what it looked like from the reactions of the kids sitting beside me. They were getting scared, exhilarated, laughing at all the intended points. And if it has worked for the target audience, it has worked. I think what worked is that the superhero didn’t go beyond his age; the pranks he played were well within a child's imagination. He stayed that age, he didn't grow up suddenly into doing larger than life stuff. Darsheel Safary's charming, not-overly cute persona works well with what he has to do in and as Zokkomon. And he's a good performer too. I loved his expressions in the roller coaster ride. On the other hand, Anupam Kher was annoying as Deshraj. I think I have something against obvious wigs. But his role as Magic uncle was pretty amazing. His makeup was awesome and so was his demeanour. A pity that our writers don’t believe in character-building. It's not like they can't or they don’t know how to, because they started something really interesting by having the yin and the yang, in the form of science and emotions. But it's not taken any further, there's no high point of conflict. Oh well, maybe that's too heavy for a kids' film. For what it is, the film is not good enough to haul the kids to a theater and cough up for the mandatory popcorn and soda. But it's perfect for a 2 hour off-time from kids when it plays on TV.

And of sensitizing them to issues like poverty too. Very in the face and forcefully shoves values down your throat.,"The words TRANSLUCENT replace the words 'Jai Ho' in the OSCAR-winning tune. And this is how my child is taught the meaning of translucent in his school. Educative, entertaining and to-the-point. Compare that to a film which is, in all likelihood made to entertain. Its target audience is obviously kids under 12. And all they do is moralize. Okay, mercifully there are no parents lecturing children, it's the other way around. And how? Not more than one or two adults amongst the entire cast and supporting cast of 50+ care about environment. And all, note ALL kids can lay down their lives to save the planet. If this one-dimensionality across characters was not enough, too many sub-plots are left without any closure - making you wonder why they were there in the first place. Not that you wanted more scenes with a huge sermon but at least some kind of an arc to the story would have helped. Again, the main story doesn't have too many ups and downs either. It starts with an issue, moves on the another one, magically resolving the first. Then it stays with the other one and drags ad nauseam. All child artists behave like kids who are practicing their lives' first skit at school - conscious yet self-important. The kids aren't given cute stuff to do either. The kind that would make you smile and at least keep you engaged, in the meanwhile. There are a number of references and spoofs of popular Hindi films, but I doubt many children would get the references because they might not have seen the original. And they are way to amateur and dull for adults to enjoy. Also no where are the happenings anywhere close to reality. For example, that these kids have parents who watch out for them, or look up on what they are up to at least once in a while, comes forth only in the last sequence. The climax though interesting because of its satire and the underlying truth is too late to redeem any part of the film. This is one of those that your kids might watch once and forget it soon-soon.

Both me and the film. Is it a coming-of-age story masked as  a family drama or a family drama masked as a coming-of-age story?,"An innocent looking boy to grow up into the protagonist, Dilsher with a thick stroke of dark grey. He can do anything to get what he wants. A viewer like me is hooked. I wait to see how it all turns out. I am intrigued by the air of mystery. And the film turns into a family drama – a couple in the midst of a cold war, a son with 'daddy' issues and so on. Somewhere in the middle of all of this, our protagonist is trying to come of age. Halfway into the film, it felt like the writer-director wanted to do it all in this film. What if, he didn't get a second chance? Only that can explain the “video album” style of picturisation and choreography of the songs. So what, if most of the songs are going to be on my playlist soon. The backstory for Dilsher's inner voice, in the form of Amira seems contrived and thus unnecessary. Dilsher's own discovery, that music is his calling, comes across as a by-product and not a destination that the film was aiming towards. The problem lies in the disproportionate screen time reserved for the Sikand family. Dilsher (Vicky Kaushal) is manipulating his way to impress Gurucharan Sikand (Manish Chaudhari). Sikan in turn, seems to have marital problems and doesn't like his son. Hmmm...you wonder why for half a second and you guess it – which is the 'big reveal' in the end. Yet, a viewer like me hopes till the end that you guessed it wrong.Anyway, that wasn't the purpose of the film, right? The idea was to tell the story of a boy who is trying to find his voice, himself. That bit is rushed up, almost as an after thought. Like an essay was prepared for an exam; the topic for the essay was “Voice”; limbs were added to the pre-packaged story to fit with the title. And of course, because it is an indie film, it has to carry some quirk – that is added in the form of camera work and sound design. The only saving grace then are the performances. Vicky Kaushal performs as if he is carrying a very huge burden on his shoulders – that of carrying the film. It gets an eager and sincere act out of him, but the load is unnecessary. Each time I watch Manish Chaudhuri, he instills and reinforces in me a fear – this character can do just about anything. Raaghav Chanana too does well as the insecure son who wears a mask of strength.However, performances and gray characters aren't enough to make Zubaan enticing. The story tries to do a little of everything. Therefore, every thing comes across as half-baked.
